0	i needed a new bass strap because my old one was frying at the ends i choose this one because it was very durable the nylon is very strong i do not see it fraying in the future the leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs the guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand good colour selection too highly recommended this capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument highly recommended just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with i bought this to daisy chain two small kustom powered pa cabinets virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application this cable filled the bill perfectly this pick holder is awesome it just snaps on to your mic stand add picks and start rockin it holds the picks securely so if you re performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away
1	compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board the quality is good i like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again very handy for making it all just right i will buy these again for sure i ve been using these strings for years tried a bunch of others as well but these suckers keep coming out on top probably will never stop buying them i now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my fender amp after i bought monster cable to hook up my pedal board i thought i would try another one and update my guitar i had been using a high end planet waves cable that i bought in the s once i found out the input jacks on the new monster cable didn t fit into the fender strat jack i was a little disappointed i didn t return it and as stated i use it for the output on the pedal board save your money i went back to my planet waves cable i payed back in the eighties for the planet waves which now comes in at around what i m getting at is you get what you pay for i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day but i haven t bought a guitar cable since this one plus years and still working planet waves wins needed an xlr cable for a gig and ordered one of these the week before it got the job done my bass sounded great through the pa and the crowd loved the band home run i ve uploaded customer supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is when you factor in the price it s plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain but a flexible platform for mounting components one other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table top only rack they work very well on the floor the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank i have a bass amp head and a power amp plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that combined weighs around pounds the rack is not stressed or strained by this weight and could probably hold another pounds safely and reliably another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components eliminating that expense i was expecting to have to orderraxxess rack screws with washers hardware pack of which turned out to be completely unnecessary my only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem if you need portability reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved such as setting up on stages this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment i am so pleased with mine that i intend to purchase another one bringing the total to three
2	i got it to have it if i needed it i have found that i don t really need it that often and rarely use it if i was really good i can see the need but this is a keyboard not an organ if you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano it may appear little awkward very durable and they sound amazing i love these drum heads and would recommend them to anyone that needs drumheads i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard it does just what i wanted it to do i bought this to use with my keyboard i wasn t really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals it doesn t work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what i d always used doesn t have the same feel either nowhere close in my opinion a sustain pedal like the m audio sp sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better the only thing i ve found the yamaha fc sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals
3	i ll start off by saying that i ve had this interface for about months now and it is still going strong i think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit not only does it provide channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out this could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio however i have a few gripes with the i the headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls imo the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aesthetics why stars the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it anyways shortly after i engaged the v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away i hope that this issue does not show up in all of the scarlett i interfaces i would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios hopefully just my unit is defective and it isn t something that is common among the i s another thing to note is that while direct monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use in other words i am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though so in the end stars the packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that i really like the build quality of the interface and focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit the only issue that i would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged overall great entry level interface sound card i love it and there are a lot of bold type enhancements to my acoustic now the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting as with all digitech pedals i just seem to love their ease of operation the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible the knobs are a little sketchy they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong but the sound is just great this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail i may buy a second one as a backup behringer hit a home run with this one not just a great sounding pedal for the price but an honest to goodness great sounding od pedal no true bypass but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you won t detect any tone suck it sounds good enough that i don t mind the lack of true bypass the g th performance capo is by far the nicest capo i have had in years of playing the main obstacle in using in using a capo is it throwing your guitar all out of tune every single time well the g th performance capo is definitely the worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune it is easy to use and holds all strings down completely and easily the g th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose very good cable well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele the reason i gave it only stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor
4	i ve got two other levy s cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they re fantastic i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what i had bought before i suppose it s just easier for theno big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and you re a big guy like me and or you play with the guitar bass around your knees you may not be getting what you thought in any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last these were the same strings originally strung on my godin seagull and i absolutely love their sound feel and durability the one reason i actually needed them because my g string broke while i was tuning too fast the sound is almost identical to what d addario describes these strings have a great uplifting sound to them hard to soft strums playing feels great with them nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel clean and smooth when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy i love the strings and their price definitely will stick with this brand as well cant go wrong great quality on a budget price hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up
5	ernie ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician community these strings are affordable and last a very long time on someones guitar during normal use you will not be disappointed in this product they sound very clean and bright and if you use a product like ghs fast fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longer they do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly these are great cables the only con i could give is if they go bad no opening up the ends to fix them but in my experience they are durable most people are using these on a pedal board so there s not a lot of movement to wear them down the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years use it every week at gigs solid no problems with the solder joints a good quality cable at a very good price hosa products are a good bang for the buck i haven t looked up the specifications but i m guessing the wire is to awg but since it s only long it s good enough what my headline says it does exactly what it s supposed to do removes those annoying popping p s out of your recordings until you can afford a sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than you re going to need this and the price was right too i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics hosa cable quality can be all over the place some of their products are good sound good reliable long lasting and some of their products are not good affect sound negatively break prematurely short useful life span these guitar cords are actually quite nice they feel good gooey soft rubber jacket like mogami they sound good and so far they are working reliably the rubber jacket is about in diameter by eye and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug i bought these when i needed cables fast for an internet concert we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up these cables arrived in good working condition and we ve been using them continuously since we have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone i would buy more if i needed them this is a fine cable at a decent price point nothing exceptional mind but it gets the job done well enough i bought the smaller behringer usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about due to the fact that the usb doesn t provide adequate phantom power for a condenser microphone not properly disclosed by the company the simple setup i have also includes the behringer c condenser microphone and a hosa xlr cable i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc over a simple usb headset without breaking the bank in addition to the positive reviews on amazon about most of the behringer equipment my son who has some experience with sound equipment said that behringer makes solid items but that i shouldn t expect much in the way of customer service he s helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items i bought to be quality as expected i m glad that i moved up to this board even though it has a lot of features that i won t personally use i m glad that this has two microphone inputs if i do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board besides the extra mic input my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in garageband i have found that my son s warning is somewhat correct at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website since this is essentially entry level equipment people like myself who have little no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects particularly in hooking things up to a computer which is obviously an increasing application i couldn t find any information on the behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a mac user for instance in addition it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring etc when using with a computer but they don t i ve done a lot of experimentation in addition to googling to figure out how to get things up and run so far i m getting quality recording results from this board i am currently using it with an rca type cable with the input to my imac s line in i might ultimately try another adapter for a usb connection or firewire but i haven t had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality i would give stars but the manufacturer should provide more information a friend of mine has used this stand for over a year and i ordered mine due to the quality and durability i saw with hers much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
6	love it i finally found one that supports my strings alvarez jumbo acoustic guitar zero issues with this cable so far it feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in unplugging and packing between practice spaces i ll update this review if when it breaks i purchased several of thes fender mini stands because i don t have a lot of sapce for my guitars and i fold these up and stick them in my closet when need i don t need them for approx ten bucks you can t go wrong they work as well as bulkier more expensive stands i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack that i had i m quite please with the xenyx lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound i m very happy with this little mixer this is a very nice cable for the price i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic haven t noticed any hum or crackles for sure a good buy seems sturdy enough and no noise issues so i m pretty much satified with it it doesn t leave the house so i m not asking it to handle a lot but with reasonable care it should last a while very pleased these d addario medium acoustic guitar strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point the strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our auto tuner and have held up well highly recommendedcfh i didn t expect this cable to be so thin it s easily the thickness of any guitar cable i ve used not sure about long term durability or signal loss interference if i had the foresight i d spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable still it works and was inexpensive edit months later and it s dead already wire frayed at the right angle jack you get what you pay for bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected snark tuners are great they are very accurate and are very inexpensive i have now four of them so i can keep one in each guitar case and one for the uke i have bought several small tuners through the years but this one has become a favorite it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible it fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front there is a metronome function which i haven t used simply strike a string if it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars when the key is in tune you will see a green indicator light and bar on each side i don t know how dependable and how long it will last since i have only had the two for about a month no on off switch is a bummer but it works solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience update after playing in a small shed for a while the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a b note we messed with the pa and all the electronics what it came down to was my mic pyle pro pdmic professional moving coil dynamic handheld microphone placement i switched mics and kept them in the exact same position and the rattle went away whats all this mean the quality of this mic is just ok if you ve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space they work well and i haven t had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises i highly recommend them plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper cords nice picks a bit small for my preference great for picking kind of harsh for strumming quality seems top notch some guitarists will love these works for practice it s a guitar instrument cable what can i say maybe not the best but it serves it s purpose these cables have taken a beating the last few months and have served me well with no problems real metal ends not molded on with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors it s nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play a lot of songs say capo preferred it helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on i recommend this product hosa guitar cables work great never had any problems with them i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect very comfortable strap the cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far good quality guitar cord very low noise repairable effective strain releaf thick rubber cover this is a great buy under bucks for a quality cord of course i just got it it might not be durable but it looks durable if i change my mind about anything i will update my review for now i would say buy one joe i just got it today and haven t spent too much time with it yet it sounded ok and i like the features on it i especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal as soon as you press down it s on lots of adjustments so i ll be tweaking for a while to find my sound but it seems like it s going to be ok it s a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve for the money it s a great pedal good product at a good price have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker great to have when friends come over to jam i ve found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by schaller and dunlop these look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strap i use them on a prs se and i did not need to do any additional drilling the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure highly recommended this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers gls audio ft mic cable is very high quality you will not be disappointed low cost long lasting i m very satisfied this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great so far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great nice and rubbery and feet is long enough if problems arise later with this cable i will update this review but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable these are not the greatest but they re cheap and they get to you fast when you need them i ve only had one fail and i ve bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio amazon is the first place i go when i need cables for audio video computers or concert lighting good music to all it s a cable no frills tangles pretty easy and due to it s design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should i ve been using these straplocks for over years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot folks this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it s not going anywhere this is a must have just buy it one end was loose so i tightened it it keeps coming loose so i had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads hope i don t ever have to open the end for repair spend a few more bucks and get a padded one this one is comfortable for mins then it s cramp time just save yourself the hassle this one is too cheap to return and while it s ok it s not great for long term playing here s what strap locks are supposed to do securely attach your strap to your guitar these do that much better than schallers and the fender rip offs of schaller i used the schallers many years ago they look great but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc but at one gig with my super heavy american deluxe string jazz bass the nut worked its way off the strap and i dropped it it was with a heavy leather strap and i did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and i m sure i kept it maintained absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable never again unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig forget about schallers they re a good company and they make great tuners i don t fault the materials it s simply that threaded things can work their way loose a fatal design flaw for this type of device come on its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident if you re having trouble getting the lockrings on i have a youtube video posted to my channel nickweissmusic just search for dunlop strap lock installation it s kind of tough at first but with experience it s very easy the package instructions are correct but not very helpful i have these on more than instruments and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade the package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock but i have never done so in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this i ve never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks if i did i d probably just replace it i do give the locks a little tug when i put them on to make sure they re engaged other than that you can forget about them which is the way it should be the only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the schallers do to which i say who cares well i guess a lot of people care about that since i see it in a lot of reviews if using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar so be it i have seen ernie ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile i think they use lock rings too maybe try those but i m sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops only complaint is the size which is my fault if you can buy at least a foot if you plan to use it on stage a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good for the price this works really well i see no faults it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now what do you say about a little chip of celluloid well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks these do it for me i like the look and more important i like the feel in my fingers and on the strings they also seem to make a good clean sound i use an ibanez electric and a gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars maybe it s all in my head but these feel good to me using any of my guitars i am impressed how well this works i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs this has solved it it s important to you to know the diameter of your guitar s soundhole i ve tried this with different acoustic electric guitars fender cd and fender kingman both of them with cm in diameter and fits perfectly i had read all reviews before deciding purchase and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering i should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound unplugged i would not consider this as a solution for it if you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar without hesitation this one is for you these are really well made straps for the money the only problem i had was that i wished i had ordered more of them i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough you get a speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around this is by far the best practice amp i have found in the past years and i owna butt load of new amps i have actually upgraded to a champion but still use this amp as much as the don t even think about it this is one of the best under practice amps unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp and in that case you should look elsewhere as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time as an addendum i would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras i have read from other reviewers i have a few of these amps so just for the heck of it i put in a celestion g greenback which costs more than the r and was very disappointed withthe results this amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now but can still be had new for under if you just do an internet search i ve been using these for about weeks now they are strong but flexible and don t seem to develop kinks or bending habits if you roll them up the proper way i ve seen and used some better cables but not at this price point and i ve certainly seen quite a few worse this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion i m a pro cheapo and i hated this thing they re noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummy like drop few more bucks and get something else this levy s jacquard strap is well made and comfortable it was much cheaper here than any other place on line or at a brick and mortar arrived quite quickly but a tracking number would ve been nice otherwise no compaints can t say much more than the description it s a cheap box that works nothing fancy and not for everyone if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
7	it is a decent cable it does its job but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth the switch is also loose the connector will move around mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications it would be more suited to home or hobby use bought this to hook up a beta to a panasonic g dslr and a kodak zi for interviews works the way it s supposed to degree trs is a nice touch good price just received this cord and it seems to work as expected what can you say about an adapter cord it is well made good construction and sound from my dslr with my mic is superb just be aware that the ends are so big that some vertical input boxes like my danelectro fish and chips can t be used with these cables because the input and output are too close together well made xlr pin adaptor to mini needed to get a real xlr mic into the computer and this did the job
8	this mixer has four mic inputs it has some fun effects this mixer comes with a hz filter and a band equalizer on the mic channels it has a fx send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono i do not hear any external noise it has a durable metalic case this mixer has great audio these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm series form factor i use mine for the much heavierblue microphones encore studio grade dynamic performance microphone and this clip holds it right where i adjust it to the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision machined mine effortlessly mate with anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom black anon stage stands b tripod boom microphone standand amusician s gear die cast mic stand black which are the only stands with which i ve used this clip bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the shure sm and pg and similar or a different brand that uses that form factor then this clip will probably not work also i cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares actually you should do that i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model i have five or six on hand including a few spares and if i needed more clips this is the one i would purchase this pedal is awesome not only does the dd offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay modulation and loop functions it s capable of looping up to seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing this pedal is amazing and i highly recomend it for any guitar player most of my pedals are boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards this means their stuff is made to last no flimsy plastics cheap rubber or faulty components or parts will cut it in boss s supieror product line considering that the sm was introduced to the world in a year after the shure sm lc shure sm vocal microphone i guess the gets batman status relegating the to that of robin but that s not really a fair assessment considering the and were developed at the same time and except for the s acoustic foam lined cage pop screen the two mics are identical electrically the sm studio microphone was designed to begin it s life in a recording studio as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers drum kits etc in that capacity it had no use for the pop screen of it s cousin the sm still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day so the sm slimmed down and even though it s still a fine vocal mic you ll see it used mostly mic ing instruments which it excels at one of it s long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the white house a pair of sm s is always seen on various white house podiums for press conferences and there is even a vip bundled kitshure sm vip dual microphone kityou can buy for this exact type of use the sm is an extremely rugged mic built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse that s one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies and on top of that it s just a great sounding mic for the price there is a performer seriesshure beta a microphonethat looks very similar to the sm but the beta has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different so make sure you try before you buy bottom line is the shure sm is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced a best value for sound companies home studio recordists and touring musicians
9	great stereo sound out of the keyboards my keys had a single stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true channel stereo so we could eq it properly and it worked like a charm i highly recommend this cable another quality product from hosa just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq i always like slightly longer length as i can always zip tie back but hard to stretch no noise from this cable this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box it lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when i need to use my table for something besides podcasting the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built there s nothing bad i can say about it if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up highly recommended on my mixer i have send returns on the same plug using a wire trs with send on the tip return on the ring and a common ground but my effects boxes like to have separate tr ins and outs this is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkbehringer shark fbq automatic feedback destroyerto the vlz s send returnsmackie vlz ch compact recording sr mixeri probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send return i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great no complaints on a side note i always clean all my cables with caig deoxit gold g spray contact conditioner oz and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce i also spray a q tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments i ve been a musician for over years i ve seen an awful lot of products come and go i don t get excited about the latest and greatest very easily but having said that this is the best idea in headstock tuners i have encountered i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff this item is definitely in the good quality family it s easy to read outdoors in the daylight yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light great design planet waves excellent price go dps
10	these are a little larger than a traditionally sized what you normally see used picks thus just a heads up having said that they are top quality and are excellent picks i use all types and all brands and fender s are always predictably great quality small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust but sometimes i play guitar in a band where i mix from the stage and the vocalist likes a little slappy echo on his voice but between songs he likes the delay off so i figured an experiment was in order i ran cables one from the aux out on my board to the delay input the other from the delay output to an open channel on my board i turned the level to max and dialed the really wet signal into the monitors and foh i let him kick that pedal on and off all night now i can concentrate on playing and not on whether i forgot to mute unmute his stupid delay win and it sounds pretty darned good i shaved a little treble off the channel so it didn t get too in the way almost like an analog quality good stuff the one i got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw i feel like if i tighten it too much i could dent my mic stand tube but i haven t dented anything yet so perhaps i m just too skeptical in any event it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction but everything works it s getting the job done and i haven t seen a better option all in all a pretty good device cheap accurate over mic even better over jack slot for your pick or coin is a joke and so far hasn t fit a pick or coin i stuck in it but that s just a dumb gimmick great pocket tuner cables are cables they usually all work and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality
11	it works really well and it s really thin it s thinner than i thought the price it s about right i needed only of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion they play extremely well and last a long time there s nothing better than these strings ordered these guitar picks for my son the picks were exactly as described we ordered the blue color which is dark blue with a lighter shiner blue design on top of it it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy he is very pleased with these picks the appearence is pleasing and it is made well very pleased with the quality we will be purchasing more picks in the future highly recommend easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip recommended well worth the price of the product this is my favorite pedal and i have a ton lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal great bluesy tones sweet and warm when the drive is down mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up like a cranked tube amp if you play the blues this is your pedal i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals it does what is supposed to i ts a gate and clamps the noise as good as i expected at the begining i had problems with power some how it didn t power correctly but i was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain so i solved it isolating the mxr connecting it with another power supply and it work so i left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine also check config and the routing of the signal this might influence on how it works i have it right after my wha and before my compressor and it works just fine fast delivery works perfectly i have of the danelectro effects pedals hard to say which i prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound i m partial to the chorus good item i was looking for a sustainer pedal for my m audio keyboard to use with garageband and found this so i bought it and it works great does exactly what it says it does and actually looks cool it s an amazing tool for keyboard player highly recommended this is a good solid cable with no problems when i m on stage i like a longer cable but at practice i don t need all the extra length tangleing up on everything the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck it s just as good as any i love the joyo pedals affordable and doesn t break the bank
12	i ve used this mic with my tascam us audio interface and pc to record a high school chorus concert and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone i placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone and one as a piano instrument microphone and have gotten great results from both the reproduction of the sound was very good the mic seems very solid in build and able to possibly take a little abuse which is good with a travelling recording system but i definately wouldn t try dropping one even though they re a nice metal case and metal grill i d recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals and instrumentals on a budget i have yet to try these with micing guitar amps but that s my next step as well as drums no complaints here the quality is great the sounds is excellent and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp use it all the time this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price as the title says it works the only reason i took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and i have to use some force to get it off the xlr but no issues besides that i was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from joyo but took a chance on the eq i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should i use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the eq but it can be used to get a scooped sound mids boost hi lowpass or whatever you need it s a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass when the pedal is engaged the lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enough i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed not the performance side of the pedal as far as i can tell but for example the n on the in label on the right is backwards and it comes in a weird box with plenty of engrish so i m skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on time will tell but for now it seems like a great box for the money i got of these to plug xlr cables into the jacks on my board i got it because my board only has channels with xlr inputs none of them work perhaps i got the wrong thing these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar they are even and not warped like the stock ones were i usually play classical nylon string guitar but have an ovation deep bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out i never have found strings that i really liked don t ask me why i never thought about contacting ovation and asking them what they use from the factory one of those duh things i didn t even think of until just now based on reviews and questions answered here on amazon i purchased this triple set of strings instant gratification first they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days but these retained tune fairly well the sound is excellent the playability comfy the tone of my ovation was back here are my itemized observations first three sets for currently cannot beat the value for price brilliance what many people call bright brilliance is the opposite of dull some strings sound dull right out of the package these strings are brilliant bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar tone the natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through no hint of tinniness plunk or twang mellow mellow is difficult to define but the best definition i ve heard is ah that sounds nice mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar it s a pleasantness that doesn t grate on your ears when you pluck a string these strings are medium mellow just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep balance at first the e overtoned the b and e but as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out the trebles became clearly audible while the e and a provided just the right touch of bass comfort the mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action these strings are just right especially the mm e which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming summary these are excellent strings which doesn t surprise me since i ve use d addario classical guitar strings for years martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow d addario just shines thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try highly recommended
13	i bought this xlr splitter to split the lead vocal from foh to my monitor rack used this way it worked great and i never had any problems with signal loss or power issues i began using a transformer isolated xlr splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter my only issue with the hosa y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when i plugged it into our lead singer s microphone it would be great on a guitar mic or something that s close to the ground or horizontally placed but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand as expected from hosa another great product solid construction and great sound reproduced i would recomed this product to everyone i picked these up on impulse they were on a good sale and i was dissatisfied with my older cheaper set of panasonic over the ears i m glad i did these are excellent headphones and they ve exceeded my expectations on just about every level the sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise they feel extremely sturdy and well made from the cans themselves to the nice thick coiled cord although a removable cord would be a nice bonus finally and this is important they re incredibly comfortable as a video editor i often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time the cans rotate on two axis so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and well padded they grip your head snugly without that horrible vice grip feeling i ve heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under i haven t tried enough pairs to make that judgement but i will say that i highly recommend them it s one of the best purchases i ve made in a long time if i didn t think that purchasing these items from amazon i wouldn t do it plus and more important i have worked as a purchasing coordinator for over years now i know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not i can find even cables that i can t find in radioshack best buys no where else i have done a lot of purchasing not just for myself but for business these ladies and gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way i would like to apply for a position with them regards ffsalsa this is a solid product i ended up not needing it so i returned it however it worked fine and gets the job done this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
14	this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genz benz bass amplification company andy said that this product is far superior to any other he was right fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle amp also fixed the effects loop jacks which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose of its power on gigs not good after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating cleaning and coating effect on the components wow and no andy does not own stock in have affiliation with or represent in any way the manufacturers of de oxit nor do i these aren t my first set i can t count the amount of monster cables i bought and own none has ever failed me so far highly recommend these i love how they sound and they are built well at this price these cables are a bargain the jury is still out on how durable they are but they all arrived in working order and have held up well despite several months of plugging and unplugging the length is great for when you have a bunch of pedals with inputs that vary from top to side i hate it when the patch isn t long enough and i have to mis allign my pedals anyway thumbs up will revisit my review if they begin to fail soon i m a string rock bass player that has purchased a lot of overdrive and fuzz pedals most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass they typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end don t provide enough dynamics or don t provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive this incredible inexpensive box really nails it you get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking the downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff the frosted side of me loves that i saved a lot of money buying this ripoff it s not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i m happy a little flimsier than the at but at the price it s good this stuff works great and is well worth the price i used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals no more scratchiness no more jarring volume spikes all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new i ll always keep a can of this around nothing more to say great stuff fantastic stuff i sprayed it in my bass guitar s pot and now its like new wish i had found this stuff sooner what was it brillcream a dab will do ya something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning worth the coin i ve got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years this stuff cleaned most of them out pretty well but my midrange pot is starting to crackle again i hate to tear the chassis out again but it d gotta happen first off let s get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the dr on the epiphone web site length bout length lower bout thickness lower bout width so now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it the only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the length most bags are you can always opt for the epiphone hard case edread or world tour rwg d or gba the bag i got now that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the review as my title says the guitar reminds me of my samick st which is a very well made spruce top acoustic which is also made in indonesia i have played guitar for over years so i have a collection of over guitars and of them are acoustics but this is the first string and i bought it just to have it around for songs like hotel california etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar i would rarely use i am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under asking price it tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out you constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure the bridge plate on these strings must be huge i found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you don t hit the large one right next to it i have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which i like the nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of that the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out i have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one i have is the later these strings actually save you money because you don t have to change em much i keep em on a year or so and i play alot out door indoor constant abuse they never rust when they break i change em now i m not a player who likes new strings to begin with so i like not having to change em they really hold up there are better sounding strings yes but if your plugin in anyway you can tweak the tone the tone isn t bad just not as good as a martin uncoated string but if you like longevity and less squeak these are great i admit i haven t had it long but so far so good i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out couldn t find another cable so i thought i d find another solution with a more generic cable this joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition which made me a little skeptical i may never need all its features but for what i need powering devices it is doing the job beautifully my pedal board includes tuner chorus and octaver stomp boxes a bass di and a rolls headphone amp the jp frees me up from any other wall warts money now i just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board
15	a classic mic clip simple inexpensive and durable enough keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break i like this pick the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers its not soft or to hard of a pick i like it the only reason i give stars is because i ordered of these and had the chord with it and one was missing the chord i ordered both at the same time other than that they are good hot mics this is a very reasonable price for this bag i got it for my les paul epiphone uke the fit is fine this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke i ll just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesn t have one
16	if they re used for live performances they will not last very long good for the price i need to resolder the ends after a concert though i got this by mistake confusing it with the tremolo effect but either way i liked it and decided to keep it it s a really good deal at the price and it sounds just as good as major brands the only problem most people find is the material that it s made of it s like a hard plastic not metal like most are but if you re not a person who abuses your gear it should last you a good while i cannot use it for recording because there is some hiss from it like all other behringer pedals and i record direct not through amp but for live playing it s great it s especially perfect for garage and bar bands i bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage it works for that it s a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables and that makes me a little cagy about its durability i tend to use it for cable runs where i don t expect a lot of movement e g running a cable to a mic stand and save my better cables for the belt pack mics the jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell and it really activated my allergies at first i stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell not everyone has allergies so this might not be an issue for all folks but i couldn t use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months they re cheap and they work fine i haven t noticed any sound issues at all i bought this one to replace a shure it s a big step up from that one i am pleased with it the old one had a lot of handling noise this one has a little but it is very good for the money i paid for it my next one will be an sm but that will be awhile from now i m very happy with this pg update december the handling noise is definitely something to consider it would keep me from buying another one of these other mics i own don t have this problem to this degree these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well guessing they are lacking some shielding
17	the gain on this mic isn t the greatest but for speeches and soft recordings this guy can handle it all very well unit works fine with my digital piano it s light portable and fairly sturdy the price is right for what you get i only do test recording with this digitally to get a better idea of my learning process from the other side it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have stars instead of only because this thing won t tune your guitar or carry your amp i use this solo in a duo with a bass player in a trio with drums and bass i have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room i use it through a pyle pro self contained pa into which i also plug my martin grp elec acoustic the sound quality is excellent the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out i would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and pa i haven t heard a hint of feedback and the on off switch is a plus the price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to i bought a toshiba flat screen for around bucks think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less the same is true of a lot of audio gear a lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it s great to have a company like shure make something so good and so affordable they have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford i cannot recommend it strongly enough
18	so far i m very happy with this microphone tone quality is fine and does everything i need it to do for backup vocals in my band although a longer cable would be nice it s great a cable and was included in the package capos are not something that i shop for i have had two for years one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type it is similar to this one yeah in looks only this one blows that one away it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways this is great i play a tele and an acoustic martin it works great on both i play professionaly and this is the best thing i ve gotten in two years just got this have used it for recording and rehearsal it works well so far and i will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years right now though i d say great product i ve used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d for several years i thought i d give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews they are lighter than i expected they are closer to light than medium i m not that impressed they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs you never know until you try update i ve gotten used to the sound of these strings and i do like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing pure bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow bg sound though at my age i need all the help i can get so i ll have to admit that i like do like these strings i started with the shure pg and most recently acquired the shure sm i d probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a neumann or telefunken mic costing g s simply isn t that much better than a nady mic costing bucks but with respect to the shure i m less sure that the sm isn t worth more than the pg perhaps if you have a sufficiently high powered and clean amplifier and have tweaked the eq settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice the two mics could be mistaken for one another it was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency p a that led me to realize the pg sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the sm switching to the more common admittedly more expensive mic gave me just the extra gain i needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice at least for announcements p s i notice that the head of the pg is larger than that of the sm since the rise of the digital audio workstation who doesn t have a computer with free included garage band on it large even gold plated expensive looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place despite appearances when it comes to mics size doesn t matter except for appearances directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half way around the face knowing that the girls in the front line think they re cool they look just like madonna a or janet s headgear some of the best mics are tiny with an opening the size of a pin hole good mic for simple live stuff that isn t too expensive it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things
19	using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet it is holding a shure sm microphone the microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic but i m using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads this is the mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects can t believe it took me so long to get one of those you are looking at what i consider to be the best friend a voice ever had during a year broadcast and voiceover career i have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the shure sm b and it s predecessors the sm and sm large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi track studio work i ve used over the years the sennheiser md ev re ev re n d shure sm b shure sm shure sm and most recently tried a heil pr sometimes this was not of my own selection but i just used what was available of the lot the shure sm b is my favorite of the ones still available the sm b is a better shielded sm and the sm b of today has a better shock mount than the old sm or earlier sm b the shielding in the b model minimizes rfi from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc the sm was a redesign of the sm i consider the sm to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn t been in production in ages i have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the rca dx and rca but they were not as good as the sm or sm or sm b today s sm b is the best non condenser vocal microphone still in production stop looking and buy one you will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the ev s i can play a sm b like a violin the others i just don t seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an sm b while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn t dj s change jobs a lot and i got tired of finding the ev re re n d mics or the sennheiser everywhere i went so i bought my own sm b i never liked the ev s or sennheiser much and didn t ever feel like they were much of a tool the heil pr is pretty good but doesn t have any on board eq options for recording not having the eq is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can t do much of that the sm b is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an re n d but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the sm b is only dynamic large diaphragm mic i know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work the others are more versatile but the sm b is the voice microphone and that was all it was intended to be it has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphone of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably that is one reason vocals sound good on a tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multi frequency overtones of the human voice unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn t intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise if you are doing a dry voiceover you can t hide the hiss of a condenser under something else with the sm b you don t have to even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves recording engineers today are usually totally ignorant about they figure anything short of a multi thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong if you want a good all around microphone this is not it if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is as others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear i ve ever connected to it i think if you have some cheap usb interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers most real studio preamps are a good match for it i ve plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too you need at least db of gain the spec sheet actually says db would be better lots is made of the low output of db but it isn t all that much less than the shure sm which is db db isn t much at all for any decent mic preamp but again most of the one box solution usb interfaces with built in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind the shure sm b comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra they all need an external windscreen but only the sm b comes with one i got mine years ago when it still came with two windscreens it has a nice metal case for storage travel i think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one shure calls the a ws but still come in the metal case i use the smaller windscreen mostly and shure calls them the rk and their distributors still carry them the smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and i d suggest getting one of the rk s but that is the only accessory you ll need to add the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged they are also very durable for foam screens on the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple eq adjustments for flat bass rolloff presence boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best you can just leave the plate off if you want this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic so i m just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work i should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new heil pr first to make sure i was still an sm b guy and it took a while for the heil tryout to happen since i didn t want to actually buy one i still am an sm b guy i would give it stars but it won t let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class i rounded it up to stars but the sm was actually a bit closer to a star vocal mic good all around mike if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio i recommend this one best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals best mike for the price and purpose if you thought a pick is a pick like i once did long ago you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and or complexity i use the dunlop tortex mm purples early on in my playing i was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better why after messing about i found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack the interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard with a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility i tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid s i like the dunlops feel grip and durability they hold up for a very long time how long i have had some last a few years they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability my students use them too i don t demand it but i do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges highly recommended you won t be disappointed think it sounds like a trash can lid no it doesn t it sounds like a crappy china which has it s place in the rehersal studio for one want a really good china spend more money that s how it works great for practicing small diameter gives it a shrill overtone poor on recordings unless you re looking for that there s always an application for though c mon what do you want anyone giving it less than stars is a pretentious wad it s it was made in the remote hills of wuhan china where they ve been making cymbals of sorts for more than years and you got one for or go buy a k kustum and quit your sniveling i say get one get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china boyah there s a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these and if it doesn t it should this is a great all purpose dynamic mic i use it for instruments vocals even field recording sometimes the sm has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals but that doesn t mean that the can t handle a voice they re pretty much the same mic as far as i m concerned and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner i think you ll find the same thing and if you re operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably then you probably already know what you re looking for i ll be getting a to add to my personal cabinet soon but if you re like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics you can t go wrong here this mic works better for some people than others that being said it is the first mic i put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them if it doesn t sound good then i try something else i have no complaints it is my go to mic this adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small dv cameras will function but with caveats first it s construction is pretty light weight that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it that s something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it this is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera that means you would need another short xlr mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter so just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others i went to sam ash music and found a similar adapter cable heavy duty and with a longer cable for the same price it pays to shop around i ve been hooked on d addarios for quite a while the per unit price on these is great and i never worry about breaking one of these
20	these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough mic great for all your needs i highly recommend them at first i thought this would be a gimmick but it was cheap so i figured what the hell once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was when performing live i always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic once i got this little guy though i just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear it also protected my mic in a fall once too can find anything better for this cheap it is not a bad mic for the price if you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over bucks but it is no comparison to a studio mic since i have worked in a recording studio now you need to decide what you want getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for it is like having hd tv and bd player but playing an ordinary cd you would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer speakers and so on if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic this mic is quite good for its price i would probably say it exceeds your expectations arrived as promised in a frustration free packing also make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit the only reason i did not give stars is mine had a little dent on the body may be due to transportation but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks i actually like this bench a lot it fits into my gear back rolling duffle style that contains my cables power strips etc with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag i have the kt which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust depends on your preference i suppose this one is smaller lighter the other is larger easier to adjust first of all this is not the best microphone ever made but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected i give it stars as a microphone period without even taking the low cost into consideration they are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra for sure i bought one behringer xm then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about years go however we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech s personal sm s are busy at another job i honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the behringers at one time alice cooper and his band were using the behringer xm s however they may have moved on now for all i know these are not shure sm clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs they have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shure s have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq ed correctly they are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq it also is if anything more versatile than the sm as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an sm to pick up it doesn t overload easily has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the sm it has a reasonably decent blast filter so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don t have to add a windscreen another strength of these is durability my have sustained numerous drops a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall no damage at all to any of them i used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now i just shrug one weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise but on the stand handling noise is no issue mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable if you want sm s you need to buy sm s if you want a good all around microphone in the to class then try one of these no on off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the sm s we use and frankly the on off switch is a liability i don t think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all around microphone for the price you can pay more and get less legendary performance indeed works perfectly extremely easy to set up very good sound good price that s bout all you need to know great all around mic used for vocals no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music if you re buying your first mic or switching from a cheapie and intend to use it for singing vocals this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation i ve never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic that came with some bundle years ago i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly you can stand feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in between the sm cn comes with the mic ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip the standard sm does not have a switch one less thing to break and i don t miss it but the sm s does have it for a few dollars extra absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you i will get another for my monitor it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic but with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics i made the mistake of thinking i could save forty bucks and get by with the shure pg i m no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp rather than a p a whatever the reason the pg simply doesn t have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the roland cube peavey amps i try to employ it with i use a adapter with the xlr connector that comes with the mic when i borrow a shure sm mic from someone the difference is instant and dramatic it s a far more efficient i e louder mic producing a full clear sound and without additional pre amplification demonstrating why it s the most popular microphone in the world for five bucks extra i can t fathom a reason for avoiding the sm s the version with an on off switch it s a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick up of private comments by indiscreet band members and even if you re an instrumentalist it may be wiser to select the sm over the sm the former mic is a little more ostentatious but it s also slightly more adaptable and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non musical sounds above all the sm has proven itself to be the sherman tank of microphones simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller perhaps a good point unless it s in reference to amazon prime which is the shure sm of commerce competitive prices no postage easy returns but anyone who returns an sm probably had no business buying it in the first place they are the populous drones of the industry invariably purchased by professionals who know first hand what they re getting reliability and virtual indestructibility in fact it s the very popularity of the sm that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators consumers require choice but with the shure sm there need be none
21	i use the cable great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great i like the smooth fabric sleeve it doesn t stick to things like a plastic rubber cable can this is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use it would probably fall apart fairly quick on the road or if it were adjusted constantly that being said it s a great little stand for low duty home use i m using it with a blue encore microphone which isn t really heavy but still weighs close to a pound this stand holds it very sturdily and with the boom feature it can be set up in just about any position i would ever need if you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget this is a decent stand and for less than bucks it s a bargain i ll start off by saying that i ve had this interface for about months now and it is still going strong i think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit not only does it provide channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out this could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio however i have a few gripes with the i the headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls imo the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aesthetics why stars the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it anyways shortly after i engaged the v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away i hope that this issue does not show up in all of the scarlett i interfaces i would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios hopefully just my unit is defective and it isn t something that is common among the i s another thing to note is that while direct monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use in other words i am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though so in the end stars the packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that i really like the build quality of the interface and focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit the only issue that i would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged overall great entry level interface sound card received it in time standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after days since i was out of days return time sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today i was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasn t recognized and i sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel now it s working these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand they do need v phanom power from your board or a mic amp i m using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which i will review in more detail later the vdc comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which i will review as a set if you do stereo recording you can t go wrong with these their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear it sounds great and setup outside with db of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away rain drops comming down and sounds you never would hear note never get these wet you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain you will need xlr cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar but you already know that this is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord it s no peavey but it works just as good i haven t used the cable yet but it looks new and durable the cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what i expected can t wait for the rest of my gear to get here so i can do a sound test based on physical condition i would recommend this product this is a black sponge for smaller mics i got mine for use with some behringer mics at first i didn t think they would fit but it just took a bit of stretching they fit really snug which is excellent because they won t fall off or slide around on the mic causing noise they do what they re supposed to do after reading all of the reviews here and around the internet i took a chance since this is my first professional level microphone i m glad i did because it s really great one thing you will need though is a phantom power unit i wish i could remember which one i got here on amazon i think it was about but it worked great excellent sound quality much better than any other mic i ve used no complaints it s quiet enough and the price is right is it a monster cable no but it doesn t cost as much either i ve used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine this box is very well made and will last a long time the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy i like the fact you can daisy chane this device with more of the same i am very happy with this purchase and i will be buying a few more now that i know they are made with quality and functions perfectly i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem besides that fact that they are quality cables the colors are pretty dope and really stand out nicely in the studio took a while to find what i needed but this is what i needed free shipping exactly what i needed at a great price ay yo homie this interface be off the hook you know i be all interfacin and stuff you feel thx behringer
22	this pick is great highly recommended i love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick grip is very good this is my new favorite rock pick a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass seems sturdy enough i side on safety so i use a soft cloth for extra protection but this item does what it was designed to and should last a long time i liked it very useful for connecting rack components between great idea in different colors i will buy it again does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating pros they look very nice they cause much less wear than the nd hand rack screws and washers cons more expensive and i had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship i d purchase these again but i now have but only need at the most once my rack is filled our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses it looks very stylish and functional as well donr be fooled by the imitations should be their slogan there are some real junky ones out there and these are great love the washers life savers thanks great rack mount screws rubber washers are perfect lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon i use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile dj equipment and they have held strong i really like the one handed operation and i really do prefer that the access to it is behind the fret board instead of out front that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy on off i ve been a jim dunlop fan for more than years and this product just reinforces that these are great xlr cables we run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent i have several gls cables and have zero complaints okay well i lied in subject line bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand i can say that with authority since i run kj shows nights a week and have for the last years so i know good singers when i hear them and they will ask if i have a shure sm to which i reply hell no you think i m going to put a in the hands of a careless drunk the more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic i d rather lose one of these behringers than a or a wireless sound wise these are great for their intended purpose if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain
23	most comfortable picks only complaint is that i would like four in a pack if you use all four fingers buy two sets bought a couple of these to build pre loaded pickguards for strats they work just fine nice solid feel screws included and white or black tips there are two rows of connectors there isn t much to say about this product except it works as advertised if you don t have one of these and you are a live performer i highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up pun intended i m an amateur sound tech we ve been using sm in our church for years now and our singers song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we ve had before our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this beta a because of the good reviews when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah for me it sounded better than sm my songleaders have tested it and guess what they dont want to use the sm anymore after having played the yamaha ypg key portable grand piano keyboard in a showroom and loving it i was torn wondering what all i would be missing out on if i went with the more economically priced ypg i now own the and it appears as if i am missing out on twelve keys that is i am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer s remorse after opting for the cheaper this is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than i will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality of course my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as i will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited as such it might be best to say that for a novice one could not ask for a better instrument for the price so what is the difference between the and the based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences first is the obvious fact that the possesses keys while the has the also includes a stand sustain pedal and power adapter which must be purchased separately for the while i am unaware of the specifics the also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices beyond these definitive differences having now played both models the also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly why buy the ypg if price is not an issue go ahead and get he it is a beautiful instrument however for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need keys purchase the like the the possesses piano style graded soft touch gst keys which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted the feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability the like the also features usb connectivity and general midi compatibility as well as almost all of the same high quality voices which separate both the and the from many other models in their price brackets besides the pianos the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic while it is unfortunate that yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the theyamaha survival kit d accessory kit for yamaha ypg ypg keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor extended warranty and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply in my opinion the ypg offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck again the sounds great feels great and is hard to beat for the price for its hard to say anything bad about this gadget it s accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument the visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that s a silly extra that doesn t interfere with anything so no problem
24	i actually replaced a boss tr with this pedal does everything it is supposed to do without the perceived that s was they say volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals if it s perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds i have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because i was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off i am a fan of joyo i own the vintage od the ultimate drive the sweet baby the us dream the crunchbox clone and this one this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal i m giving it stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap but the octive leaves much to be desired i have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue apparently one of the components is installed in a reversed positon which results in the lackluster octive i haven t taken mine apart for the fix but i read that it s just unsolder flip and resolder the same component you can google it for better instructions still this ain t bad for the pocket change they charge the reason i haven t fixed it yet is i have the feeling that once i mod it it will sound just like my dano french toast albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass hey it gets the job done and that s all i can ask for i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all while some had better casings metal instead of plastic at the end of the day i m looking for a good sound not a pretty pedal board the pedal seems solid enough it doesn t take up much space it sounds great and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come and if you are like the typical musician you are looking for something that s not going to break the bank first i bought a fm dsp on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store that was my mistake i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks well here it is friends in all it s glory tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price it s loud it s clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it add a danelectro distortion pedal of some sort off amazon for distortion and you re home i own nine amps including fender crate and peavey tube models and this is cleaner if you play c w look no further if you fingerpick this is your amp electrified banjo mandolin or violin this is the amp but if you follow the darker side keep looking hello musicfriends this is built cheap but sounds great good controls too for me in the studio songwriting its perfect but i would not exactly go on tour with it there is something about the knobs i still love even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it may be the age thing it does what it says it does only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled times a week
25	it is exactly what you need in a capo you can cover all six strings move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down all in all a great capo that is well made and will last forever kyser is an awesome small christian company and i really like their products and supporting them with my purchases such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes worth every penny mind you does require some length and height adjustment for some epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put so far so good went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand haven t used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected so far so good i recommend it quick to clip on and off really is there anything else to say what else do you want it to do these suckers are wonderfully reliable i ve had one for about years the only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the bottom of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect however for a keyser sent me a bag of a about of them can you go wrong no great product this will work for just about everyone but i prefer the walker williams brand but these work fine easy to get strap locks on will keep on the side for next guitar you shouild be happy enjoy like this camo capo s simplicity and its unique color my friend got a new one after seeing me using it but his is a bit shorter than mine mine works both uke acoustic guitar i have no problem to use it on single hand as the manufactor suggests for its duration i don t clip it on the guitar when it s not in use this capo looks great and does the job it does take a bit of pressure to open the camp but its better then the winding versions re strung my eko ranger with these d addario ej light strings and am again getting a nice ringing tone with good sustain no issues like breaking or dead strings that i had with elixir s just good sound these take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm they made my cordoba c sound like a more expensive guitar not overly bright just a richer tone i see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts much more fun than a black box i own one of each model i automatically put these on any guitar i own as soon as i buy it i change strings and toss those white plastic pins makes any guitar look so much classier i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too phenominal value tons of bang for the buck they look soooo good on there installed easily in different guitars so far i seem to have problem with getting it to hear low e of all strings but it is very compact and convenient to use i ve seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but i ve never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this kyser one it is by far the best i ve ever seen and i ve been using it for years now and it still works fine it makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn t corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years very highly recommended these strings retain a good feeling for a long time well past the point of them needing changed because they ve lost brightness i ve owned many tuners through the years and i keep coming back to this one buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point no problem at all great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thak you very much bought these because i thought they d be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when i want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce they give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string and they don t wear down the strings and i actually use them on occasion for my steel string acoustic guitar when i want a nice mellow tone the only negative is that because of being rubber they stick to the strings so they aren t great for quick strumming which i wish they were this is an excellent gig bag plenty of compartments for all of your accessories well padded and has enough carrying options a good buy i heard great things about the s and so being a novice without any idea of what to buy i bought it based upon reviews i ve played it for a year and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars here are my humble thoughts the seagull is comparatively unattractive its snake head headstock with the tiny not great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar the cedar top is very nice looking and the rosewood fretboard bridge on mine are very nice the laminate sides back seem much thicker than competing guitars and this makes the guitar heavier and to me less alive resonant during playing the satin finished cedar top is very easy to marr the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force but at a heavy strum the top seems to bottom out and lose definition the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok the binding is a sharp degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing something i ve not encountered before i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle nice all in all it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it s made in canada for asian mexican prices that said just because it comes from canada doesn t embody it with mystical vibes in fact for the price range i can get a just as good asian mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back front sitka spruce solid top wood better tuners and a more attractive headstock with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good i don t regret getting it but i feel like i overpaid for what i received and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade s exchange rates i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price seagull to me is over hyped thanks for reading what s to say it s not a high end capo and for the price i can lose it like most of the other capos i have owned it s not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly i love this guitar strap button it s a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink it works well for it s stated purpose and appears to be of high quality the leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole check out my user name stinkylungs on youtube to see a video i made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close this style of capo can throw your guitar out of tune if you don t put it on right when used correctly though it does it s job just fine i purchased this for use with a sennheiser e s microphone and the bestselling on stage boom microphone stand the mount has exceeded my expectations the fit for the stand is perfect with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down the part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out a screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase
26	i don t believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo but this one is quite good for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use it does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built it is as with all capos important to take it off when not in use so the rubber does not get grooved this is just good common sense if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another i bought a string one in blk love it for simplicity and needed it so i didn t have to keep searching for the other got gold to remind me it is for six strings i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive i use this mostly with my honeytone mini amplifier and reel echo tape echo simulator works very well with no problems a lot of danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to ac voltage outlets it s a capo nice fit yet sometimes i wonder if it fits too tightly as when i use it and of course the strings are tighter sometimes i feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight yet it is a capo structured very well this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case the only problem i have is it smells terrible but that s fine i just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable other than that this was a great investment these strings are a little more money than the average strings but they last longer great for the dedicated guitar player puts on a good shine for your instrument i like the spray bottle applicator you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings i bought this capo for mywashburn d it works on my orlando classical guitar as well i wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn t too expensive and the kyser quick change guitar capo fits the bill nicely update my orlando guitar was stolen boo hoo easy on easy offthe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off rubberized clampsrubberized clamps helps prevent the kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets ergonomicthe arched arm with the weird looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the kyser capo durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum update i ve had this capo for almost years and it s still working like a champ according to amazon s instant order update for moi i got this capo on november the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video it s the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent i don t think you can go wrong with this one i have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently the price is right for these and they work just fine my only real issue is that sometimes they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you re going to bar thus producing a sound you weren t looking for some of the higher end capo s counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring however like i say these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard and are from what i can tell the most popular model on the market easy to use capo good strength holds the strings down well not sure that it s as good as the g th capo which i still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune but the kyser is much cheaper and does a good job probably the best kapo out on the market very high quality and a sleek look easy to use what more could you want the description says the color is gold it s not more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for i think i would stick with the black color though works great but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time some responses to comments i ve seen in the reviews i ve had mine for years used moderately and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible haven t put a pad there or anything the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz however range of motion is on the wide side to get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic i have to put it right on the edge of the st string and screw it down all the way and it does sometimes leave some buzz the price is nice though so i would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo the package arrived on time this is the best capo around and works great does what it is supposed to do works great just clip it on and jam out forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one you ll be happier trust me i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons it is lovely clear shard silk screening the capo itself is really good it is very snug on the strings i got pink cause nobody would steal it and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great nice feeling to them they get the job done and that about sums it all up can t expect to much more from them
27	i searched on amazon for a banjo strap and this came up when i received the strap i realized it doesn t fit a banjo i then looked at the description closely and found it says it s a guitar strap just to let you know this is not a banjo strap i was able use it anyway on my guitar it s not the best strap in the world but it s not bad i gave it four stars for that reason i think it would wear quickly with lots of use i chose a star rating because i ve simply never owned a tuner of this high quality in my lifetime this tuner blows away my old guitar professor qwik tune tuner this tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion martin makes great sounding strings i decided to use light martin strings because they sounded louder and better and i could play them just as easy as the lighter strings these picks have served me very well i am happy with the quality of all of them i would purchase additional planet waves assorted pearl celluloid guitar picks i was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what i got there isn t too much to say about it it s sturdy it s adjustable it s a great price it really made playing easier for me a must for every serious guitar player this is one of the easiest to use slides that i have ever owned i have been playing for about years i play mostly classic rock this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide dunlop does it again i love these strings and use them for all of my acoustic playing best of all i can find them here for per set so i m not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time easy to play and they sound great long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time this is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff honestly the best effect it held was the phaser jet pipe effect i got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted it does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price bodow from trinidad it came in nice packaging cable looks great feels of high quality so far it still works well ft is nice for home if you re a performer longer is required
28	these are okay strings for the folk guitar nothing special but the price isn t out of the world either good buy for the money tried them on a gibson j and they seem to do good nothing that spectacular really it did it s job was easy for my husband to use made me able to use a strap on my guitar i restrung my martin ny with these strings and found them to be excellent as a new guitarist the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound even though these are folk strings i put them on my year old dread and they sound really good i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing so far so good
29	i have a gibson les paul that i bought used when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry i first tried lemon oil and it would work but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it its rosewood so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey i ordered it and applied it a few hours later i restrung my guitar and started playing and didn t care for the way the fretboard felt i think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn t completely dry i decided to give it another hours the next day the guitar neck looked and played great it is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ bends and slides are smoother than ever great product and one that i will continue to use if you need a quick treatment before a gig or something i would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation i am worried that i will damage my instruments if they are left standing around this will allow me to show off and protect them it s good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price doe s not stay on to well moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned after buying this product i have concluded that is a lot of money for foam does the job but i think the velcro job would be preferable to this one martins are no doubt excellent strings the light strings carry excellent deep tone and are not to hard on my fingers this item was received well packed and on time provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks yeah the strings that it came with were terrible but it s an amazing guitar i ll admit i bought it because it was cheap so i could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged but it sounds great and plays really well i like how the wood finish isn t all slick has a nice natural feel to it i m using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks it was smaller then i would have pictured but it still is a good product it can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off only problem i had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in besides that its highly recommendable to anyone i will definitely pick up more for my other axes heard good things about the ernie ball slinky string set and decided to give it try on our son s taylor gs mini replaced the worn out strings out of that guitar and he is back in business honestly though it is hard to really compare strings these seem fine and currently i see no reason to try another brand in conclusion i see no reason not to buy and install these again please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help it s good was having a lot of feedback and got tired of taping a make shift sound hole cover recommended have used them for months with no failures decent quality ends and build there s really nothing else to say about them and i m saying it now to reach the minimum length requirement buy some now this thing does just what it was supposed to i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that and it does just what it is supposed to works as advertised the cutter makes this thing really worth while if i lose it i m buying another more words required i bought one of these to try on my asher junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick worked but it was difficult getting all three picks in one wedgie so i ordered a second one between the two of them between the nd rd and th th strings up next to the nut works pretty good holding these types of picks which admittedly the wedgie was not actually designed for liked it so much i ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass the bass version only down side i see is they do seem loose like they could fall out and i doubt the picks will stay in place when i case my guitar haven t tried it yet but otherwise worth the price and a good doo dad to have around especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself real help to me staying organized
30	i ve played string instruments for the better part of years starting with a cheap tijuana wood box as a year old progressing to martin and string acoustic guitars and a few electric fender and gibson units all good in their own respect i decided to treat myself to a les paul for my th birthday but not having the financial resources to buy a git i shopped and shopped finally settling on this cherry burst lp it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding it was even sorta in tune but a quick dial in with the electronic tuner brought that right simply put nice guitar after allowing the strings and neck to settle in together i spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height intonation and pick up distances and now this lp rocks if you re going to spend mid range on a fine practice performance guitar you can t go wrong with this one kids two thumbs up suggestion a fender mustang or amp makes this guitar sound even better bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar it seems to work well no issues in the first couple of weeks this is a fine guitar but it isn t amazing my particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear coat there s one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick guard mounts to the underside of the body neither would be apparent to someone who wasn t appraising the guitar but they are there and don t look normal to me maybe i got the first one off the line after they switched from black painted models my guitar also has a weird v shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn t match at all i m guessing that it s a joint that has been glued together i know that the better les paul guitars have a one piece neck and since i didn t read about this one having something different i assumed it would be the same glue is stronger than wood and les paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area so i guess my guitar should be more durable than some still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery i m not sure that seeing these finish issues before hand would ve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar but upon reflection it would ve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying my remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all les paul guitars versus my particular instrument the guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap even while sitting the top strap peg is angled up slightly where guitars with horns have them angled down which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a les paul the pegs just don t stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars it s great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that real les paul guitars do but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup the range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small and i found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated strings without additional hardware the guitar sounds decent it looks pretty great although not quite as pretty as the pictured one and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars note the shorter scale length is characteristic of les paul guitars it doesn t indicate that this is less than a full sized guitar though this is a fine guitar for the price i m not sure that i would make the same choice if i were in the same position again i bought it years ago here at amazon and i couldn t be happier this was my first electric and after over a year of owning it i got a way more expensive fender strat and i still prefer how this epiphone feels it is really lightweight a lot more that even other les pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars i have tried this makes it very easy to play it stays in tune and it looks really really lovely i like it so much that i decided to add a pair of slash s alnico iis on it that cost more than the guitar itself this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain good ol crunchy bluessy rock call me cheap if you want and i wouldn t care this is one of those items that makes you wonder how come there s others way more overpriced and just don t find a way to justify that a real gibson les paul will sound better it wasn t until recently after years i estimate somewhere around hours of heavy use that it started fretting and that s why i gave it only stars but what would you expect from a guitar i m sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet tone machine it has always been if you re learning looking for a first electric or just want a practice axe that will not dissapoint you just go ahead and buy it don t give it a nd thought and do it i have been playing for over three decades and it has been a while since i have owned an electric guitar i bought this amp along with a epi les paul all i can say is wow this is a great combination this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects well built and looks even better in person than the picture plenty of power as well better than anything including the stage quality amps like marshals from back in the day a great practice amp but good enough you could use it for a small gig going to pick up the optional foot switch if you buy you won t be disappointed well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning am i impressed u bet cha this thing is simply beautiful it arrived well padded in a double box initially i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws none not a finger print on it anywhere this guitar is extremely well made and put together right it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter the neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities i put a quarter under the th fret and it s right on the money it s considerably heaver than than i thought i would imagine it weighs about lbs i have a strap ordered and on the way the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had your hand floats over the frets i don t think you could get a better piece for the price point this is one awesome guitar i also purchased the fender mustang i amp epiphone custom case fits like a glove and planet waves planet lock leather guitar strap comfortable and very secure which made for an unbelieveable combination along with rocksmith i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination the only problem in my household is who gets to play next waited two months before reviewing my les paul to make sure there were no issues i am very happy with the guitar it came well padded and was in excellent shape it was set up well and has played well out of the box just did my first string change making sure i used the same gauge of string and didn t have to make any adjustments to the guitar played as well after the change as it did before was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it s a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play free prime two day shipping no sales tax and saved about in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store the savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new mustang v amplifier the only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box this one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer it is not a big deal to me but i thought i d mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone when i ordered this one i wasn t really sure if a cable would be included or not so i ordered one at the same time i m glad i did
31	i swear by these strings these are the only strings i will use on my les paul their bright tone sounds great and full while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze don t buy these strings just because i like them buy them because they suit you because you like the tone they provide because they feel good against your fingers cons what cons try them it d been about years since i ve had an electric guitar i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned i decided recently after moving back to my home town that i was going to get back into playing electric guitar only this time i wanted it to be more than a hobby i fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will easily deliver it came in perfect condition the action is set perfectly and i don t have any issues with buzzing strings it comes with clear black control knobs which i ll likely replace with something a bit prettier but overall this is a great guitar it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp because well o it is a lp its no gibson but it is a lp very happy with this purchase works as described for the price i have no complaints at all clamps firmly and easily doesn t move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic i love this assortment every color and size you ll ever need you can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality i would buy this again or recommend to anyone i use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though definitely a star purchase good overall but pick ups are terrible might be better replacing the pickups but i wasn t willing to spend the extra money i got this pretty fast i took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it stars just for value alone i m still shaking my head in disbelief that i got this guitar for the price first the tuner issues that i ve been reading about replace the strings i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune a set of d addario s cured that straight away or whatever you prefer just change them the tuners aren t the best but they are not to blame it s the cheap strings now technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box the neck angle was so off the a string rattled no matter how high i set the bridge the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle yes i could have sent it back but i suspect i would have gotten another just like it i had to spend about hours shimming the neck and the nut never had to do this to the nut on an electric not even on a used guitar the nut slot was cut too deep as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable it required business cards to shim the neck which is the most i ve ever had to use after i got that straight i removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws in my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal but as i m looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work i m steadily staring at the qc passed sticker must have been built on a friday afternoon or something now after i did this it is sweet i play through a peavey valveking and it rocks as good as my strat w duncans and dimarzios the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all after adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them i d argue that this is as good as any epi i ve ever played as far as pups and all so don t hesitate there because i don t really care for epis and i m in love with it i bought this to sell mainly but now the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it otherwise i d highly recommend a more expensive model the models are great right out of the box usually this is really quite a fantastic little gizmo it functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick simple and fun it is easy to read from any angle it adjusts every which way you just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations showing you when you are sharp flat or dead on quite amazing especially for the price highly recommend and i m stingy with my star reviews i got one of these a while back and being like i am with guitars took it apart to see just what it s made of mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but it s plywood body inside kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there otherwise decent build basic original lp design bolt on surprisingly good electronics w full size pots and open back way toggle good neck but bad tuners note any mount tuners meaning mount hole at and o clock position respectively will fit with the bottom hole of the screw junk tuners mine had so add to get more than minute in tune play here and you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with i like the style and though there s plywood involved still good fit and finish though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are only in looks electric guitars don t resonate that s why pickups are important i don t like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys you lose interest learning on something that can t hold good tuning so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that it s likely they ll keep this style but revise it some to be hardwood body and real tuners as i think the price point demands it otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups but they were a little too much for the squier bullet i put them on even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck while i had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness more metal moving over a guitar pickup hotter sound more gain and on a stratocaster more glass and bell like tones i ve used ernie ball s slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound fun fact get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery there is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound ringing out of your amplifier a little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent i ve been playing with my brother s lunchbox and when he first plugged in for a jam at his house i thought he was joking this amp can easily cut through drums even in the close confines of his practice studio granted i am not a heavy hitter but we were messing around with come classic rock from the early s and this amp at three on the volume knob was plenty loud the tone is very good but not exceptional it s not as clean as a fender or jazz chorus but it s still better than many of the amps i ve listened to if you want to make this a spectacular tome machine plug aboss fbm fender bassman pedalinto it about the quirks the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb it does give a hall like sound as you increase it but was designed to simulate an open back amp more than a true effect the gain controls the input signal to the amp and according to the manual is more like a soft overdrive the volume level is solely controlled with the volume knob with the gain knob playing no real role in how loud the amp gets finally the speaker switch on the rear is for turning the internal speaker on and off not the speaker out circuit for routing the signal to an external cab that means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the inch internal speaker off or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal one plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker you need to do that with the speaker switch personally i love that feature because you can also use the phones jack as an output to a pa with the amp s internal speaker still active you definitely need to follow the instruction manual and especially the advanced user s guide or you may be initially disappointed my brother returned the first unit he purchased because there was a pop when it was turned on or off as well as a slight hum when it was idling the replacement amp exhibited the same problems however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems i mentioned quirks the power on and off procedure and positioning the gain knob to the mid level are the keys to smoothing the amp out bottom line this tiny amp packs a punch and has sound characteristics that have to be heard to believe if you want true reverb you will need to plug in a pedal check out theboss frv fender reverb pedalif you haven t already but for small venues and practice rooms the ambiance feature is probably all you need do take the time to read the documentation before you start using it because when this amp is properly used it s simply amazing the cry baby has proven itself since the s it is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock it takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level the epiphone les paul guitars don t particularly sound that great but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar but you re not completely sure if they will stick with it if you can spend another and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele the reason for this is because for if they decide it s not something they want to do anymore you can resell it at the same price you bought it for as long as it is still in decent condition and little no money is lost second if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a better or more high end guitar mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use i have a couple different high end guitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still i ll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions this is the neatest little light i have ever seen it takes aaa batteries included but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out and has nice leds the lights are bright enough for my something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand battery life so far has been at least hours actually probably hours as my daughter has been using the light also i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable a real needed item is you play in darker rooms my son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it great purchase
32	i started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck i found that i needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the g th both are very good i did notice that if i had a wider neck i think i am mm at the nut on my two takamines the may be a bit short they work and are cool looking i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great cheaper ones also work this a great instrument cable if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of regular cables i bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home he has guitars everywhere i am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars it is pretty good at staying in place though i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim i just received these tuning machines today the pegs line up so they drop right in remember the e a d are that tall capstans and the g b e are the shorter capstans it all works out i ve also put springs in the block i like stiff tremelo bridge flush to surface and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional strat knobs had to get cts split shaft k pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar but back to the tuners they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning much easier and faster to change strings i just ordered another set for my strat h s s great guitar but could certainly use these tuners wow these cables are made really sturdy and the noiseless feature is priceless definitely a real good value for the money very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and don t want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find a long time planet waves user i trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards imho it is not the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip i like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar and into the amp at the other end the actual cable is horrible it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should e g like my old planet waves cables do they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre very disappointing purchase i like the sound of this pedal and the ability to get the right over drive sound i want i ve used it with my reissue s fender strat plugged into my vintage marshal watt head and a slanted cab love the sound i am also using this pedal with my ibanez gb arch top jazz guitar and i am amazed with how good of an over drive i can get i ve also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better
33	i purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago and have always loved it i only use pedals and this is always one of them it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds i have played boutique chorus pedals and the boss is loads better in every way you will not regret this purchase pros easy to use no hum small sonds awesome indestructabecons noneif you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever will last forever and sounds incredible get this i ve only recently heard of joyo pedals and that s because amazon com kept recommending them to me i normally stick with boss pedals they sound good and they re all the same size so they re easy to set up maintain this pedal was priced very well and had nearly a star rating i used to have a boss phaser i don t recall which number off the top of my head it was a pretty complex little pedal and sounded great but i needed money and sold it when i saw this pop up in my amazon i got curious did some research and decided it would be a wise investment sure enough it was it s obviously simple to use having one knob and all over all the pedal sounds great and seems to be very well made based on this experience i m very much interested in checking out their chorus flanger and overdrive pedals i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive simple yet well made and great sounding phaser very very good product i have no complains about it definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard good and transparent compressor with low noise operation very tough construction although not the best it sounds good to me it depends on the situation the sustain is good jj tubes are the best sounding vacume tubes the only tubes that go into my vintage boutique amps
34	good strings for my electric guitar i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal i completely agree with that and it will sustain your notes it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate i use the ns when i use my chain of pedals that said this pedals has some wonderful uses every note will have the same volume you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume you can set it to sustain for days again you will need a noise gate there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as active as this one perhaps that s the price you pay for what this pedal can do i recommend messing with it quite a while you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it when its about wah effects i m too careful cuz not all brands make it well when i found this one i can be shure that there is no more wah sound out there crunchy warm and with the clarity of this i prefere vox in wah effects and this its a great choice and its too cheap for the quality you get happy with this recommended the boss cs is right for me i have been using it with excellent results i have many compressors line mxr behringer digitech and although i alternate their use the boss stands out on many rig configurations it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product i highly recommended it as your main compressor if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it good luck in the reviews for this item there seems to be a lot of debate over what the fender mini tone master is and how we should evaluate it is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier do we review it compared only to other mini amps or do other small combos costing under creep into the discussion well i bought one for myself and the conclusion is this it isn t the best way to practice guitar quietly at home but it s also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you d expect appearance durability actually the aesthetics of the mini tone master are one of my favorite things about it this is a conversation piece that i wouldn t mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies it just so happens that it s a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also the component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap yet are put together in a convincing way take a step back and you d swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather the grill cloth over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers actually while the amp is cheap it s also fairly durable in fact i just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review and it seems to be working fine phew it should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a v battery or a v dc adapter a boss pedal supply adapter will work for example while the battery option is obviously nice for portability the red on light seemed noticeably dimmer with v s and i can t say how long the battery will last if you plan to have it in one place most of the time the adapter is the preferred way to go sound the concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it a one watt output with twin speakers given that each speaker is smaller than the tweeter on a large stereo speaker you won t be surprised at all to hear that there s virtually no bass in the sound it sounds like a poor w solid state amp only shrunk down to a few inches at the same time that s kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier and it puts out a fair amount of sound i opted for the mini tone master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones low gain high volume produces pretty good clean tones and with humbuckers and the gain turned up it can get a bit raunchy unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally i haven t figured out which yet i had it at most of the time but it didn t seem to cut much treble as i turned it up actually it got the brightest around and then almost became more muffled beyond that but again for a mini amp my expectations were not that much to begin with i do like the four knobs and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on off flat toy switch i expected the speaker to overdrive break up if you pushed it too hard and not in a tube like manner that wasn t necessarily the case but there are other problems something internally rattles after the volume goes above and it s not the speaker being overpowered this is a common issue with cheap amps and i might even pop it open to see what is rattling around and the sound quality isn t objectively good by any means but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style alternatives the primary reason i rated this instead of really isn t any of the issues above i am happy with the amp but it s limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home quiet practicing my favorite of these by far are the vox amplugs which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers the sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality and volume fullness than anything this mini amp could do also they are offered at or so it s simply a better value another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software while sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps the possibilities for effects modeling and recording are endless if you think about recent improvements in small size bluetooth speakers you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the mini tone master offers at the same time those speakers can cost up to and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp your opinion of it will depend on your expectations but if you don t take it too seriously it s a cool little device and in my book anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at ok i am a pro musician rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road i was using an old ibenez chorus pedal one of the first to hit the market of which i did not use much basically due to it s used for certain songs i upgraded from using separate pedal boards to a single unit decided to buy the boss ch super chorus to add to the collection after my first gig i removed the ibenez chorus pedal because of the tonal superiority of the boss unit i am certain there are units that may boast of being better but i have found through my years of playing that more money is not always better great tones easy operation and it is the best bet for the money
35	i ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try i d been looking for a boom attachment for a non boom stand because i play guitar and sing this seemed perfect and it is regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book they can be helpful but also take up too much air space on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces this thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself the other thing i like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock so you re not just tightening a joint and relying on friction as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired anyway no reservations about this one a dead simple idea that works great i have had this pedal for about years just replaced the old one a month ago it distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though this effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color i use it through a epiphone valve jr and a marshall x stack with jtm on top and its fine this thing through a champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a eq pedal this does just what it says it does one volume knob one tone and one distortion knob crank it i have purchased three of the fender f neck plates for three different mim strats they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says it distorts you want something to make your guitar sound like junk this will do it why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use boutique and distortion are an oxymoron these things are built with heavy metal it should last i kinda hope it doesn t just kidding you want distortion you got distortion i don t gig it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd but if you re like me play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres this amp is a blast it is very likely that i will play a johnny cash song on tuesday and a metallica song on wednesday pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound no pedals no hours of minor tweaks just punch it up and learn the song virtually every genre is represented here i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it i prefer traditional r n r sounds and the spider iv recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds even with the best modeling in the world my les paul does not sound like a strat being played through fender it sounds digital no getting around it something else that weighed into my purchase was durability although i only play for fun i still play hours a day my year old also is learning to play so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily the one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of line amps was that they were long lasting and durable i have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger just becuase they can take such a beating ultimately i decided that for the price at the time i couldn t beat the line there is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp they sound better more prefessional they are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes although the line sounds tinny and at max volume for in home play it sounds terrific there are mountains of reviews that compare the line to vox marshall or fender they are all better than the line every one of them but be prepared to pay times the price for effects pedals head units cabinets cables etc to get those flawless professional sounds good amp great value this is a great invention i have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this it really saves on batteries and extension chords it is well worth the money here s the deal with this pedal it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money in my opinion for spending less than for a distortion pedal whether it is your first pedal or th pedal a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it this is a little more expensive than some other brands but i think it sounds great and it s way more durable than a plastic pedal i m pretty new to electric guitar so i m not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers to me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp so i think it s a good purchase these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time this pedal has been around for a long time and though the overall quality has declined as boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals the boss ds remains the staple image of distortion stompbox s the ds is a no frills tank of a pedal it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as michael moore stepping on it so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it this pedal doesn t replicate any type of amplifier it s not a marshall in a box or a mesa boogie or a vox or a fender from a tonal aspect it isn t complex or dynamic it will add plenty of grind to your tone and plenty of hum to go with it if you re looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your watt practice amp look no further if you have a decent tube amp look elsewhere because with this pedal you get what you pay for and it simply will not do a quality amp justice pros inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal cons lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast without the excessive hum and almost unusable tone control this would get stars what a fantastic product i believe i have been wishing for this for years only one problem make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot no longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal board i have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is t u f f i you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product still holding strong building another board and using this stuff it s much better than regular velcro i don t have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away in the reviews for this item there seems to be a lot of debate over what the fender mini tone master is and how we should evaluate it is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier do we review it compared only to other mini amps or do other small combos costing under creep into the discussion well i bought one for myself and the conclusion is this it isn t the best way to practice guitar quietly at home but it s also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you d expect appearance durability actually the aesthetics of the mini tone master are one of my favorite things about it this is a conversation piece that i wouldn t mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies it just so happens that it s a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also the component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap yet are put together in a convincing way take a step back and you d swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather the grill cloth over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers actually while the amp is cheap it s also fairly durable in fact i just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review and it seems to be working fine phew it should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a v battery or a v dc adapter a boss pedal supply adapter will work for example while the battery option is obviously nice for portability the red on light seemed noticeably dimmer with v s and i can t say how long the battery will last if you plan to have it in one place most of the time the adapter is the preferred way to go sound the concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it a one watt output with twin speakers given that each speaker is smaller than the tweeter on a large stereo speaker you won t be surprised at all to hear that there s virtually no bass in the sound it sounds like a poor w solid state amp only shrunk down to a few inches at the same time that s kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier and it puts out a fair amount of sound i opted for the mini tone master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones low gain high volume produces pretty good clean tones and with humbuckers and the gain turned up it can get a bit raunchy unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally i haven t figured out which yet i had it at most of the time but it didn t seem to cut much treble as i turned it up actually it got the brightest around and then almost became more muffled beyond that but again for a mini amp my expectations were not that much to begin with i do like the four knobs and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on off flat toy switch i expected the speaker to overdrive break up if you pushed it too hard and not in a tube like manner that wasn t necessarily the case but there are other problems something internally rattles after the volume goes above and it s not the speaker being overpowered this is a common issue with cheap amps and i might even pop it open to see what is rattling around and the sound quality isn t objectively good by any means but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style alternatives the primary reason i rated this instead of really isn t any of the issues above i am happy with the amp but it s limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home quiet practicing my favorite of these by far are the vox amplugs which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers the sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality and volume fullness than anything this mini amp could do also they are offered at or so it s simply a better value another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software while sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps the possibilities for effects modeling and recording are endless if you think about recent improvements in small size bluetooth speakers you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the mini tone master offers at the same time those speakers can cost up to and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp your opinion of it will depend on your expectations but if you don t take it too seriously it s a cool little device and in my book anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at it s a very generic sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp the same is true of many of the pedals from this era including the gasp tube screamer the tube screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp but not too many people will tell you that it s a great stand alone distortion because it s not same goes for the boss ds now here s where things get interesting there are plenty of modifications that can be done to this pedal by keely monte allums and others that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks for the cost of this pedal and the or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod are well worth it mine is modified with the monte allums tri gain rectifier modification and it s absolutely killer i use it as a lead boost but by itself it s a nice overdriven tone that you ll find plenty of use for if you want a basic solid well built distortion pedal this is it but by itself the boss ds is really nothing special but as a platform for great sounding mods you can t go wrong
36	good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should only problem is i prefer to wear it on my ring finger but i have big hands viz xl and xxl gloves and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger a bit annoying but not the slide s fault i guess i bought this as for practice i have a amp but was looking for something a little more portable this is what i came to it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too the lead cuts clean mostly in general is does tend to get a little noisy though however for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever like i said i have a sort of name brand amp that is estimated at around i can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp until i can afford a really good amp this will be my primary one and really i have no problem with that pros cheap price fair sound quality nifty built in effect can plug into aux letting you play with musiccons cheap item quality distortion can get messy not very versatile metal only i hope it never breaks the dimarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available the dunlops tend to release if they re bumped and the schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use i use this mostly with my honeytone mini amplifier and reel echo tape echo simulator works very well with no problems a lot of danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to ac voltage outlets its a great pedal sound really crunchy i got a peavy vyper sometime i use this if i want a crunchy style but the amp i got is really good and has its own distortion styles i use the heavy metal config on this pedal i recomend it to anyone does not introduce noise i run it on the stock battery it still works you can make your guitar sound like metallica or megadeth of course it also depends on a lot of things like pickups amp etc i also have a very old little peavey practice amp this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life listen to it on the boss website i heard to it and then i thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them but it does sound really really close regards forgive my english not from the u s by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be i run a randall g hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state i ve used or heard for recording i use a peavey and its so sweet tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard recently i started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that i felt like could only be achieved through a pedal there is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals i used the dod death metal for years when i first started playing however there is a downside go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old am radio if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least quality dist pedals are not budget friendly i chose the mt because i know boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using it gives a variety of sounds it can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones the controls make it very tweakable and i have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it read the included book look up some mp s over videos online and check out other guitarists settings it will help you tame this pedal into what you want perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot there are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful i ve seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz i must say learn how to shape sound spend time dialing it in to your rig within minutes i was pleased with the mt i used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick heavy distortion with a good response i say the mt is worth an investment if you re looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board i bought this pedal after looking at the boss tu and korg pitch black for bass this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode strumming all or strings works well for a quick tune but i still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune the accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low b i read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out tc electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped imo but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselves i was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the ad g strings and it worked okay the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze i chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as i can i tested this sweep option on an old ibanez artcore guitar which hasn t been played for years and even with old strings i got a reasonable tune out of it strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune i am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old boss tu i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze
37	i like the quality of the picks not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style thanks consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does unfortunately that s about all it does however if you want to have the perfect break on through guitar intro sound this is absolutely the pedal for you quality wise it s awesome and if i needed that sound i would definitely own one again i got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions and honestly i haven t missed it because i m not in a doors cover band or anything i use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom h this adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events i own several of these and love them i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional also check out hosa s sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter
38	mxr make pretty good pedals for the money i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion it is not it has plent of volume which is good for boosting but even with the gain knob turned all the way up this thing is an overdrive which is not a bad thing if that s what you are looking for very mid rangey sound as well just not for me but it s well built and would make a decent od but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal highest quality guitar i ve ever seen in this price range it looks feels and sounds amazing a i bought two excellenti like i am very happyi am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you i ve been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job yes it could be metal and i wish the button gave a satisfying click when i step on it for under thirty clams i can look past these things i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation i really have no complaints at all with it s performance so i am glad i didn t shell out x more money so i can feel more secure when i unlatch my pedal board in front of gear snobs i don t think i need to run this pedal with every amp i own but it does a great job opening up the sound of boxy or dark sounding amps when i run it in the effects loop of my palomino v great little practice amp btw that little amp sounds huge also great in front of my blues jr if you own an amp with a single tone knob pro jr valve jr etc or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp s controls this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead once my sound is dialed in i leave typically leave it on and forget about it it s also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar i also own an olympus ls this gives me the same recording ability but it is much less expensive you do get the ability to record with four channels which i am dying to try once i get my hands on encoding software also nice and not included with other brands a tripod to hold the unit a handle to use the unit like a microphone charger and earbuds some have noted the zoom doesn t have speakers built in if you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it you need monitors or quality headphones i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls this may be a big issue if you don t treat your equipment carefully time will tell but i have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money i am also looking at the zoom h which will come out in sept this product may actually be the ls killer the dimarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available the dunlops tend to release if they re bumped and the schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use this pedal really hits the spot warm vintage analog slap back delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate which if you are a fan of johnny greenwood you will love i also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound with the modulation on and very short delay time sounds almost like a phaser i bought this pedal after looking at the boss tu and korg pitch black for bass this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode strumming all or strings works well for a quick tune but i still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune the accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low b i read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out tc electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and

pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old boss tu i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze great as a booster as others have said for solos it ll boost your mids and your signal as an overdrive it s great kind of a midsy marshally sound it does suck out some of the low end but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever it s a boss it s solid and a great price remember this is overdrive not distortion for distortion look at other boss pedals this is a superb tremolo pedal its dials allow for enormous control of the effect it s very sturdy an often noted feature of boss pedals further it s utterly easy to use allows for both v battery and power supply adapter operation and most important of all it delivers beautiful tremolo note it comes with a v battery installed but it does not come with a power source adapter if the price is more than you re willing to pay consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo this also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much sound manipulation as the boss product it s still quite good but the boss takes the prize i paid about for mine and have zero regrets
39	i have had and tried about every compressor out there lastly the old standard dyna comp only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone blah this is a very transparent compressor i use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric low setting on the switch and compressor set at about it gives wonderful string balance and sustain at this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds and it does not wack the bottom out of your tone none of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string just balance and sustain as close to a rack mount as it gets the blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues from here you can get any type of compression you want or need mine has a white case as some of the other reviews state you barely need any type of guitar cleaner when using these microfiber cloths i ve found for the best results use a wax sealant product and then use this cloth separately and afterward to clean your guitar the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly in a world of round wound strings flat wounds the original bass starings aren t as popular these are nice and bright love em terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps i ve played this pedal for a while now and really dig it i m old school fender blues deluxe reissue and strats and teles this pedal has a great warm organic feeling tremolo that i use a lot you can barely bring it in for some warmth or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect i ll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b type of organ sound the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well it delivers massive fuzz plus sustain for that purpose it s excellent both in sound and construction it feels like a metal brick however be warned if you re looking for a standard distortion pedal this is not it it s a fuzz pedal it delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal like say a boss ds if a great fuzz pedal is what you want this is a superb choice and so far as i know the best one for its price if the price is still too much for you consider the modtone fuzzer which is about as good but substantially cheaper at least as i write this the mxr phase is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen at present i own an mxr phase a boss ph phase shifter and a line mm modulations modeler with a few phaser patches so i can compare these three units the phase has a single speed control that sets the rate of the phase so it is simple to use if there is a single knob that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit in this case i agree the mxr phase is by far the cheapest of these three units in my opinion it also gives the best sound within its capabilities and actually seems to boost the volume slightly the boss ph gets a slight volume drop but it is workable and the line mm has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because i usually don t leave modulations on for an entire song but turn them on off in different sections unless its a chorus of the three the phase has the least versatility you can imitate the phase sound on both of the other units the line mm does a slightly better job and both the ph and mm have more sonic possibilities also the boss ph will give a lot more spacey extremes than the phase which stays in a normal range but again of the three the mxr phase sounds the best of the three at what it can do bottom line a classic pedal at a great price great sound slight volume boost simple to use limited sonic possibility safe or normal guitar sounds no crazy extremes beautiful bright orange color you can t miss it compact size does not eat up pedalboard space
40	i am normally a guitarist in my band but i have found myself at times needing to play the keys also having two instruments to play a pedalboard and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage so this adapter made things much better for me when i find myself back in that position works great with my on stage keyboard stand if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must worth every penny i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar i was using a borrowed first act guitar without any amp and i wanted to see what kind of sounds i could make it was inexpensive and fun to use the sound quality isn t the greatest but that s to be expected you can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds it s very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable i pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects but i wouldn t want to take any chances i use this mostly with my honeytone mini amplifier and reel echo tape echo simulator works very well with no problems a lot of danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to ac voltage outlets this is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier the first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it this has a replaceable sponge you take it out soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container would say it gets more humidity out this is the best little guitar pedal adapter i ve used and i ve used many over the last three decades it s exceptionally quiet which many are not and it puts out volts which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery and you won t have to buy a new one every dozen hours i ve used this on a splitter to drive three pedals but at four and up i can hear the current drop a bit still that s a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers not a box on the floor but it sure is nice to have some gilmouresque delay and a little extra gain driving the tubes and this is the best v adapter for pedals available that i know of including the boss ones dan has released some cool well made pedals in the past years and this little wall wart is a worthy companion a very good deal at clams as stated in the title this adapter is what you need if you use your danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries you can now plug it into the wall as advertised it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so i ve owned it the reason i took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn t seem too durable so because of this i have been very careful so it doesn t get broken you might be able to find an off brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the honeytone so you won t risk ruining it what can i say lower priced than most and very low distortion i could not hear the hum but for multi pedals to save on cost i use a godlyke power supply but this is a good power pack got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great price was right i already own two and had no problems quiet no hummmmm buy it if you need a wall wart
41	i ve been using a crybaby for going on years now some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way well i ve never noticed to me these always feel perfect also you can adjust which part of the sweep you re using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the pot i ve tried other wahs morley doesn t do it for me and the vox is very good i just have always gone with what i knew no complaints with the crybaby this is the mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects can t believe it took me so long to get one of those good strings though in use i didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard diaddario phosphor bronze strings if you are familiar with shubb s they are by far the best capo you can get some people do like the big close pin but if you don t buy a shubb in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist the crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as i can foresee case arrived in great condition quite roomy fits my vendetta and or my les paul two exterior pockets for tools extras etc x thicker padding than the epiphone gig bag i got for the lp but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away i m not hauling them to shows get one the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode the screen could be a little brighter otherwise no complaints the best non rackmount reverb i have ever had so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb excellence once again from tc i owned this pedal for many years before finally trading it in on some other equipment it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing the sound it does very well is the late s early s fuzz sound white room black curtains satisfaction ina gadda da vida note this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound as i said it does one thing very well but its range even with classic rock is quite limited if you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound this pedal gets you of that sound if you want to also cover other classic rock you re gonna need at least one more overdrive distortion effect i am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide this one works fine so far it is rather heavy and i like that i also like that because it is metal if you drop it on the floor it is not going to break like my glass one did be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger i purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago and have always loved it i only use pedals and this is always one of them it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds i have played boutique chorus pedals and the boss is loads better in every way you will not regret this purchase pros easy to use no hum small sonds awesome indestructabecons noneif you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever will last forever and sounds incredible get this for many years i ve been playing with proel and fender cables until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components best of all warranty for life or maybe longer using the string cleaner on a regular basis helps to prolong string life and keeps your guitar sounding bright and full a repeat buy if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound then get a boss gt guitar multi effects processor and install boss gt patches by james limborg search google for boss gt patches by james limborg oh its a crybaby i have a crybaby wah you suck because you don t own a crybaby i m tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn t even tell you how many strings their instrument has this wah pedal just doesn t cut it maybe at one time but not today it hasn t been up to par in a long time as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal my mom bought me this one i thought it was awesome until i learned better it took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when i finally did i thought i broke it the eq on this pedal isn t good there is no smooth transition from heel to toe there is a big drop in the freq that kills the effect you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop you have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board i can t say its just a complete piece of junk it does give you a wah effect it is a classic pedal but there is better out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing i even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue i still had to slam on it to turn it on off and it still sounded like a cheap wah my suggestion the mark tremonti wah is great kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use it may cost more but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway so just go with the tremonti power wah to begin with what i use for wah is the digitech rp processor you may say that this is a cheap processor and it is but i ve been using it for years and i haven t seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters why i suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on i have mine set fairly light and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily you even have presets crybaby being one of them you can get an entire processor full of effects and an awesome wah for a little bit more if you want a cheap child s gimic type toy this is for you want to get serious about a wah spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere i ve had my wah pedal for a number of years now what i can say is that it has put up with a lot of use no problem with the pedal itself mechanically however the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time if you mount it on a pedal board you will probably remove those feet and this won t be a problem also the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal if you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable at least on my unit the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat what i have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push all the way in otherwaise zap other than those two issues the power issue really no fault of dunlop s if you use the supplied power cable its been a great pedal a classic that will surely live on the dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition and looking great it also had two soft cloths that are needed for application removing excess and polishing i couldn t be happier it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board if that s not a problem definitely worth the price i acknowledge that this is a minority opinion perhaps i just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards but while i loved the sound and functionality of this wah wah pedal it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable i suspected that the potentiameter was shot so i had that replaced but the same problems reoccurred like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it good product but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit i had
42	i guess i have tried about every type of pick around thick ridged things with thin strumming edges great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side look this is just easy the star hole means i grip it and it doesn t move until i let go never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the pick pen on the counter of the local music store trying to find that feel right yup cause they were three for this pick is well designed for mandolin playing unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners it s also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them i use to misplace my picks all the time when playing and now i do not have to look around for them any longer as i know where to find them i like to use different gage picks therefore i have ordered more for christmas stocking stuffers whicdh will be enjoyed by my friends does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come was not too expensive for such good quality a real workhorse for sure not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars i also have the guitar one which is incredibly big almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it the strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition the strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable i would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap
43	the ukulele is very cool looking it plays nice it doesn t sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele it comes with cheap strings but it s a very fun ukulele i think it s worth a hundred dollars i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center when i first got there i was looking at the lanikai brand but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that i felt like a strong wind could tear it apart then i saw this one it has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range i have already learned the basic chords and can t wait to become proficient with this instrument costs about x as much as some cheap capos and it s worth every single penny this has a strong clip yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks it won t budge once you clip it and it s low profile made of metal it should last a lifetime i took off one star only for one thing the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways some other capos like this onejim dunlop russell banjo uke capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side away from me the player but it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones that said i can work around it and it s a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes if one was to have large hands as i do not this interference may be even more of an issue to consider c ya happy strumming mahalo these stay connected but aren t so wide that they change the style of picking i like them and so does my music teacher we try to stay stocked in these picks love my assortment of picks and the price was right i like that their is different gauges because i don t always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but i only received instead of picks but whose counting i m still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again thanks works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too this works amazing it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin it also works great for a guitar it works really nice with steel strings but i have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin it only works correctly above the rd or th fret on my mandolin any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn t have enough pressure to work on the st or nd fret position on my mandolin even though my mandolin has a fairly low action i have a number of kyser capos and very much like the style i own at least six kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a taylor string to a fender american strat without any problems but in this case the banjo capo didn t work for what i need perhaps the capo sent to me was defective although i have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn t seem broken just not up to the task from feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it but i know that i don t have time while on stage to take seconds to set a fussy capo just right to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn t start to buzz on me in the middle of a song i went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo this is the second tuner i have bought like this i got it because i need a second tuner they are very good tuners and i highly recomend any tuners this company makes i have several types of capos this one seems well built a little bulky for string banjo especially if you are fingering near it i really don t need to change that fast so use it very little might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply this rosin is great because it s encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin it s so easy to apply and doesn t leave any messy residue on my fingers i haven t been playing the violin for very long but did know i needed something to rosin the bow easily this was exactly what i needed i use this all the time for acoustic guitar banjo mandolin as well as an autoharp and my daughter s fiddle i ll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused for my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open g even if it s too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well i ve used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job nobody really gets excited about tuners but i ve been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that i know of when i started out if you wanted to tune and didn t have a input good luck this little gem is worth it s weight in gold so easy to tune with it we have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong automatic shut off helps too
44	seriously this is a great pedal i can t improve upon what others have said but i will mention a few points i use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone or to add more crunch to my fender frontman when inserted in the effects loop it s run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me i sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies if it gets noisy or self oscillates after a while change the battery to a fresh one better yet use an ac adapter i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews otherwise it s been on my setup for about seven years i take care of my stuff i bought this as for practice i have a amp but was looking for something a little more portable this is what i came to it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too the lead cuts clean mostly in general is does tend to get a little noisy though however for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever like i said i have a sort of name brand amp that is estimated at around i can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp until i can afford a really good amp this will be my primary one and really i have no problem with that pros cheap price fair sound quality nifty built in effect can plug into aux letting you play with musiccons cheap item quality distortion can get messy not very versatile metal only i hope it never breaks the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic i can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either the heads are all too large i believe i used these on my gibson les paul custom years ago and they worked perfectly not on my newer sg though at least with the new screws it comes with fender start appears to take the system well only time will tell almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys when i put them on i felt confident that i wouldn t have that issue anymore it s easier to strap up because of the quick release tab this should be every bassist guitarist s best friend the winder works well for me and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool so i don t have to search out a pair of snips but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward also the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy and doesn t work well for reluctant pins i actually like my dunlop winder better this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more but i guess that s the compromise of having a working cutter so i won t be throwing away my other winder any time soon this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use i stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar i actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica but those were dismal failures big win for the guitar though this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use it s easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone it s easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist the crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as i can foresee perfect for hanging displaying your guitars very sturdy they hold up well to both my bass or guitar without moving or flexing both are on the heavy end i own now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection these picks are nice they re great for metal if you like a durable pick the paint fade away after a while but don t let that stop you it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time no complaints about this hardware easy to install with patience easy to use the click on off system securely holds your strap and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post these work like a light switch on off so i m not sure how you can rate them as poor there aren t really any directions so it takes a little mechanical knowledge just a little it s not rocket science to make them work quality metal secure function and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts i ve installed these on a hoener full sized squire acoustic and fender strat s this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars i tried this untreated microfiberpolish cloth on my gibson es because i had heard good things about it we ll begin with some stats the cloth is by and has an border stitched aroundthe edge it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea there is a small warning on theback of the package that states not designed for cleaning electrical devices you can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water rinse it out and hang it up to dry now to thereview my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny i have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body s front and back and backof the neck i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off when going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish what i discovered about this cloth even with increased elbow grease is that it has it s limitations so if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out if the body oils have been there for awhile probably collecting dust then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it i decided to use dunlop s dunlop formula guitar polish cleaner to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely since then i have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the planet waves microfiber polish cloth it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid i also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind you want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play i would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything i gave this untreated microfiber cloth stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort my highexpectations based upon the blurb were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around it was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess nonetheless i like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime i will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time i am done playing good quality seem durable enough sure there are better cables out there but for the price these are hard to beat i m not on tour with any group i play for church and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home with other musicians willing to give their time plus an occasional gig for a town celebration or some such activity i ve got a few sound effects pedals and processors i like using but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car this mini pedaltrain easily holds four of my favorite devices it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy etc the case is awesome too heavy duty good stuff the board came with velcro tie wraps power head etc to mount and use your devices i had it up and running in a few minutes and it makes my travel and play experiences easy without looking for a roadie to get help the angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect since i first got it i ve rearranged once already talk about easy you ll be glad to have your sound effects mounted wired and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear tear on wires from just handling i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments though i am not a professional musician i find each them to be of equal accuracy in fact the d addario s compact size and fit is totally un noticeable and though its screen is micro in size it is very clear and viewable denoting flat sharp notation a great choice for the price wow i got more than i expected from this chromatic tuner sure it s a plastic case but who would be rough on a pedal anyways had it about weeks now and im impressed i see people say the blue indicator light is too bright but truthfully its ok because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough if it is too bright for you just put a little piece of black tape over the light but like i said its ok cause you can still see the tuner lights i use this pedal with thevisual sound one spot combo pack works like a charm for the price you cannot go wrong with this holds my les paul and feels secure i ve never had any issues with this don t bother spending x as much for something that does the job as well as this edit bought another one this christmas for another guitar and this one feels as good and as simple as the first one i gave it a star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks but this ft cord is taller than i am which means it s about tall it s a great product for the money exspecially if it s just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp it s short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working very nice product great quality i ordered three to start was not sure if i wanted to trust my guitars to them arrived installed in minutes they come with plastic toggles to screw into drywall i chose to hit studs rubber washers come with to size for different necks if you are going to mount off a stud i strongly suggest using an aftermarket high quality toggle made from steel very happy going to order more i ve had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven t failed me once i love them and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so they rotate in full circles and are super durable you should buy them for all your guitars and you ll never have to worry again they are also very easy to use and install what s great about the dunlop design they work the only thing you need to do is ensure you ve got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i e just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear end off without worry the design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around rotate on the post which is exactly what you want the schaller ones see below have a major flaw in them from my family s experience we will never run anything other than this design going forward what doesn t work with the schaller design our family of guitarists and bassist have been using shaller style locks for a while now every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new th anniversary american p bass not good my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend the problem with the design is there s a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that s screwed into the body unscrewing itself we ve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon we tried to make the shallers work but just could not maybe we re all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us i have never owned a straplock system prior to owning these dunlops and boy am i amazed every straplock system i ve used in the past on friends guitars semi permanently mounted the strap to the guitar often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim in contrast these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off it s great better still the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes making installation trivial and the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that i think i could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch using the posts like the oem ones this is a great system and i would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar my wife plays the fiddle and the mandolin and this stand works great for both of them it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport i ve been using these picks for years they ve always been great between these blues and the yellow i m covered i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product a work around for the main issue follows the review the flaws that bother me in order of significance are quality very weak soft metal screws using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw heads on all that i worked with of them rounded out so much that i was afraid they would be hard to remove later causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws engineering the instructions recommend and the screws the ones that come with the straplocks are designed for a phillips screwdriver however a standard driver is too big to fit into the strap buttons so you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit or using a which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job engineering the point of connection for the strap is th of an inch out from the guitar the strap button has a radius about ths of an inch therefore any lateral stress i e weight of the guitar is magnified by more than x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw a pound guitar would be applying a constant to pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher realistically if the screws weren t total crap this might have been a or star review once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won t fit and get the things properly installed it would probably work out for most people so if you are stuck with a set here s what i recommend go to a hardware store and buy x oval head stainless steel replacement screws note that these won t fit properly but they are the closest match and can be modified they are cents each at my local stores and would have cost dunlop maybe cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this put the screw into an electric drill pointy end in so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head it doesn t need much i used a belt sander and it took about seconds each while you are at it file down a cheap screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button install with the new screws as normal and recommend that your friends try a different brand i agree with other reviews that boss exploits its customers by insisting the pedal have the psa supply but sells it separately it s a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine just glad i didn t have to shell out more to boss for something they should have provided with the me the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good you get a letter with an arrow on each side and it s not very responsive the korg style dial in reverb controls are easy but extremely limited expected better you get either room or hall neither are that realistic going from manual patch level to bank level is awkward it may just take practice next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected if i set the e level delayed signal level or balance at around thirty it can be clearly heard when overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected but the delayed signal remains at the original volume effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudible did boss just start making multi effects pedals have they learned nothing despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me does have features that recommend it some of the drives are usable the controls are accessible and easy to adjust the solo setting on the comp fx module is a nice booster although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the od ds module maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boost the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches i was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting but all it does is turn the preamp on and off or step one way through the presents fs u it almost appears that boss very cynically crippled the me so it did not threaten gt sales i m looking forward to learning more about this pedal so far it does some good things but it could be much better has anyone else noticed the me reviews out there aren t too useful i m thinking of checking out the vox tonelab ex which is being blown out now at gc for example update despite the limitations above i like the portability of this unit it runs on aa s i think which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play for example at a jam where you don t have power nearby new fail update the tremolo in this unit just stinks i mean stinks whatever the waveform is it s not a sine wave not smooth at all very poor musical characterists whatever engineer was in charge of this you screwed up big time your own boss tremolo pedals are much better than what you ve put in the me why would you do that boss i like tremolo but it s virtually useless in this unit some people won t notice but if you like that swampy fender style tremolo you will be very disappointed i like these straplocks but they were a little tight to get on a levy s strap i did manage to get it on however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box i guess boxes is good as it provides more protection sadly when i tried to use them amp it didn t work i checked the wall plug cord flicked several switches and knobs but still didn t work needless to say i sent the amp back to amazon which was quick and painless i wanted an exchange i expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me but i was shocked to find out that as soon as the return ups label was recorded at the ups store they shipped out another amp and it arrived in days since i returned the first one wow that s customer service the amp is great small footprint sounds great for what i want it for which is bedroom basement practice amp does it s job very nicely i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless honestly i don t think i will every fully utilize the full capability of the fuse software i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there i may use someone else s uploaded presets and play with the various options later on in summary stars for the amp and stars for the customer service i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy i purchased a set of these strap locks years ago and i dont recall having this issue so i m thinking that dunlop changed the screws at some point i was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle and the locks are secure however due to this issue i m considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon what else is there to say they are easy to use they are easy to install and they are easy to check i ve tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to no expensive pads to buy just use water simple to drop down into the body of guitar no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole comes out as easy as it goes in i have of them love i know this is a great product i ve had a set before i have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless the product comes in a clam shell package for me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some there are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn t fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere i found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return if i find a retaining clip that will work i do have one to compare with then i can use it that said i ll say again the straplok system is a great product i know i ve owned another set for more than twenty years a little story to back these lock s integrity i installed them on a korean made washburn wg v incredible guitar after tweaking i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar the screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood and i epoxy all my screws in before the strap lock broke amazing nice tough hardware the only complaint i have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided easy to install just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system fast to take on and off of your guitar i would suggest getting a tough thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps i have now switched over to dimarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with dunlop locks for many reasons and i am very happy but this product is grade a i always felt secure with these straplocks our bass player uses some expensive and heavy fender basses and he loves these strap locks i ve used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count it s hard to find a tough low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere but this one is the best one out there for the price paid its made well with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that i love i use it for all of my equipment connections and it simply works with no problems and no noise that i could detect try it out you ll discover the same as me and my band mate s have that this is the best cable for the money on amazon i m in love with the dual design system it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly there is one downside to this system as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time one component which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren t much help either the directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go but i didn t know the name of the piece nor could i readily find it in there after that i installed this into my new guitar and strap and i was ready to go i highly recommend this it is much easily to switch out straps w o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process i have used dunlop straplocks for years i bought the original style years ago for my strat les paul and partscaster the last two having the most weight these things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem i ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out it was on the strap i used the most for the heavier guitars so i got some mileage out of that thing i ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar i suggest these over the other brands watch what touring bands use these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch if you happen to be without a strap with locks on it these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping great product accurate small functional inexpensive better battery life to previous generations very good quality adapts easily to any type of guitar heads i always purchase grovers for my guitar straps but my gibson les paul standard plus had a bigger strap knob so i bought this dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly a good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system i use this often to record my band s gigs now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks tough to even strech this into a full review this is a no brainer great strings an industry standard at a great price what s nor to love have them on four guitars never a malfunction easy installation and use watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses work very well nice low profile easy push button on and off but it is true not good for thick straps and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use these are really great guitar locks i use them on all my guitars and i would highly recommend them to anyone i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles it s also cheaper these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best the software itself sound interface starsthe installation and activation starspros the drums included in ez drummer are the most realistic computer drums i have ever heard i m using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit i use ez drummer with mixcraft and have modified pretty much every beat i have used so far with the built in midi editing capabilities the interface is clean an easy to use you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw cons when i was reading reviews i just thought the people complaining about the install activation were being wusses i mean seriously how hard can it be well they were right it sucks it took me two hours to get it all working my advice don t even install the app from the included disc instead just go create yourself an account at toontrack com and download the most up to date version and all the patches for the modules that come with it my experience try to install from disc fails with a google d the problem found out i needed to get a toontrack com account and download the installer from there downloaded the mb zipped installer then i had to unzip the files which took about minutes on my pc i was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install then i had to jump through one final hoop to active it take this key copy it here then copy this here stand on your head etc great software horrible install slick i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals i ve knocked this microphone around a decent amount and it is plenty rugged i couldn t be happier with it at one point i had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat but then i smartened up worked my calluses to the point where i could probably play s tuned to e with no trouble and realized that these strings worked great for my strat because of the strong tone that these provide and ease of bending on the upper frets these strings also are good for les pauls where the scale length is shorter than the fender guitars making bending like velvet the surprise here is how they traded a little bit of diameter the fatso part for incredible flexibility the other f part looks great no noticeable noise or signal loss a really nice change from stiff skinny rubber cords i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now it s time to treat myself with this gift so i don t have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china it s very rare thing to see now a days wow i m really impressed with this tuner strumming the strings gives you a quick overview of which strings are out of tune and as you tune each string it automatically switches to a chromatic mode it s quick it s accurate and it just works well i ve owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable i keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs string trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts the dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required i m using this pedal like a clean boost for leads and i m very happy with it s sound uncolored db of clean gain give these picks three days and you llnever go back to another style almost impossible to slip out of your fingers great tone amazing clarity effortless harmonics durable and fast this pick literally makes you play better i ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use very secure the best i ve used so far i don t know if this is a common problem but i have these on both of my basses and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing like metal does before it rusts it is literally only one of the arms out of i have so i think it was just a random thing the problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn t just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose and one time the first time i didn t notice and it actually fell out notice i still like the product this was just one of those things i think so i would still recommend it i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy keeps things in place one problem the coating will wear out in a short time a few months and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside this might make it a bit hmm i don t want to say hard to lock but you d better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure mine has un clipped a couple times because i didn t check our climate is humid so it s rust friendly which could contribute to why i m having issues however once clipped properly you shouldn t have issues great buy
45	summary for those who don t want to read the whole thing this is more than worth the money if you re a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you re experienced and are searching for a backup travel option or anything like that get this do not hesitate a cheap guitar doesn t always mean a pos alright full story review so when i was a kid up until my early teens my insanely talented and self taught older brother helped me learn how to play guitar i got pretty decent but somewhere along the way i stopped and i ve regretted it basically every day ever since then recently i decided to stop internally griping about it and realized i should actually do something about it so here i am having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists i have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and i have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars like a typical beginner s first act i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it i got way more than i bargained for i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited there was no way i could afford to dive right in and buy a high end top of the line fender or martin like i had had the benefit of learning on back in the day i knew i had to go cheap at least for now i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars after an exhaustive amount of research i chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos i d pulled up on youtube were excellent plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general despite the positive reviews i was still a bit leery buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble even if it sounds nice and plays well sometimes a perfectly solid functional instrument just doesn t feel right as i went through the checkout i silently reminded myself that i could send it back for any reason i went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility i d just have to bite the bullet and buy something better even if costlier well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed i certainly didn t expect perfection and i was convinced that i would find some kind of error if only cosmetic with such a cheap guitar i am here to tell you that i have not found anything wrong with it even if i had unless it drastically affected the sound playability of the instrument it would still be worth the price along with the guitar i bought some new strings martins because times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable i see that some of the other reviewers disagree maybe their strings were older or maybe it s just preference i don t know all i can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded old shockingly enough the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box it doesn t seem to have any trouble staying in tune either all of that being said it wouldn t hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe i mean i m sure that when i do finally put the martins on i ll be even more mind blown than i already am with the way it sounds this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets oh and contrary to what other reviews have said yes it does have a truss rod while we re talking about its positives let s not ignore the fact that it s also super attractive with its shiny black finish there isn t much about it that would give away its price no it s not a guitar but it certainly doesn t play like a guitar either i don t regret this purchase at all even in the future when i progress and upgrade i will definitely be keeping this lovely gem if you re still unsure do what i did and listen to some demos on youtube i doubt you ll be disappointed pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did he clearly doesn t know what he s talking about and i as well as everyone else in the comments section was sure to express my feelings about that haha one user even claimed epiphone should sue him check out the video reviews by the users companies goldhat samashmusic giggear and shadowfw my only complaint about this guitar is that i didn t buy it sooner good luck on your search i hope this review has helped over the years i ve literally owned dozens of electronic tuners generally five or six at a time in various locations ranging from a musiciansfriend promotional item to a rack mount most have been in the range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko the seiko sat e is my all time favorite because like mama bear in the fairy tale it affordably splits the difference between too small and too big it stays put on the floor when i run it inline between my guitar bass uke and my amp and its lcd display is large enough to be legible when i m standing at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare bravo great guitar companies don t always make or sell under their aegis the best strings i love my teles but i can t stand fender strings likewise i love my martin ukulele but trying these strings for the second time i had the same conclusion as i did the first aquila s are far better aquila s have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound the martins begin to hold their tune sooner aquila s take a couple of days or more but the sound is thinner and the feel isn t nearly as friendly the approximately dollar price difference is not for me worth the lesser satisfaction even on my least expensive ukes considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings the higher priced aquila s still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks use the martin s or any cheaper string when you are working on your uke put the stress of repeatedly de tuning and re tuning on them then switch to aquila s for playing some may like the martins but few won t love the aquila s like it better than the other tuner i bought this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again
46	this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up allows you to get close to the mic and still play an instrument like say a guitar can be used either sitting or standing recommend highly be sure to get a pop screen for your mic and recording needs to improve recording quality its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting squire fender guitar in terms of e to e string spacing the low e string out of range and not fit in the hole two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled but it seems it will cost me a fortune if i keep using these i think picks are like well you know a personal choice i bought these cause they are simple inexpensive and will compare to others i have been using these lately would buy again don t even hesitate buying this thing it s everything you need it s a pop filter it clamps on to anything that isn t over about an inch and a half in thickness it gets the job done buy it this saved med at least instead of getting a traditional pre amp best invention ever also portable downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but i keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it there on the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use it works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make shift panty hose pop filter what else is there to say this microphone s quality is amazing i just hooked it up to my pc windows and it worked no hassle whatsoever nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great i recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises the stand that comes with it is very stable but it is low to the ground or in this case desk table so it may pick up some unwanted background noise computer fans mouse clicks movement etc filter works very well and looks professional only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure the thing is that they don t seem to stay i mean you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic arm but it doesn t stay where you put it and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality but i think if you re lucky if just might get the job done i really liked this one i bought the crunch distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone i very much like how joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced boutique pedals i will continue to buy these products from joyo until i find something wrong with them and at present i have nothing to bitch about at all here sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound as an example this is the jf and jf on guitar and the jf on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a line spider buy this these pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open which oddly had staples holding it closed this little guy has help me record with my apogee one voices and amps to prevent air flow shock on diaphragm wanna have excellent recordings get one hi guys really simple little review here this is a windscreen it does windscreen things pros it works it fits my microphonecons the package game a little smushed so it s a little misshapen it s it works if it s not the highest quality stop complaining it s what did you expect kevlar filter is of good size and easily comes apart for changing the fabric i will probably use panty hose if it gets torn other than that it works so what more can be said i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought what could possibly go wrong i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new first the package was stapled that s right stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened then to make matters worse there is a hole in one side of the fabric when i order something new i expect it to be new based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller i bought these because i really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show and these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place i bought two because i use a digitech live harmony processor and two xlr mike cords are required to make it operational good price here too hard to find just mike cords usually longer ones are only obtainable i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy it would be nice to have a counter weight for the long reaches but can work around that detail its well made yes you can make your own pop filter at home but you don t want to why else would you be reading this besides it won t look this good i ve purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months the most recent one i purchased was not this one i wish it was i thought i d try something different just to see the differences well i can tell you that there are significant differences between this and some of the others featured here the bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to the competitors that i ve tried do not if you do not have this rubber piece any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly this is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible fortunately nady placed this rubber piece on it s clamp so this has never been an issue the only complaint i have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times a single dot of superglue fixed that compared to the other pop filters i ve seen and used this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can t beat it and yes pop filters are a must with condenser microphones just buy one now save yourself the trouble it does what it s supposed to do it s as well made as most i think they all look cheap to me unless you get a studio professional grade the screen pops out easily but it will pop back in it works well for my home recording peter piper picked a pack of purple peppers test passed no puh sound to be found on the recording this is a decent pop filter it gets the job done but it has a few flaws it attracts a good amount of dust the screen tends to mess up which caused me to tear the first screen the goose neck tends to unwrap it s self out of place it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in other than that it s a decent pop filter but not for the price under would ve been better i should have went with something cheaper than cough cough the auphonix pop filter cough cough but i will in the future does not stay in place well i read several reviews of pop filters on amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were finally i just went with this one and i m pretty happy with it it seems quite servicable it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough the arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don t bump it i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it i think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer i can blow on it directly not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles and i feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic so then i m gonna keep it and use it till it rots or gets lost though i d warn if you don t know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de esse the whole thing but between the pop filter and a slightly off center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses s from making an appearance in any way works exactly like its ad says it would eliminates pops and secondary noises in the background easy to install nice looking not much to say other than it s a good cable good solid connections with no play after consistent use it s going strong at first i was skeptical of this nifty little tuner but since i ve been using it for the past few weeks i ve yet to have one complaint it sits right atop clipped to the guitar operates on vibrations so doesn t pic up other guitars is light barely even notice it and seems quite accurate this was a great investment for my home studio i ve been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone i should of bought this a long time ago works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made but other than that works as intended i love this product it is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar you end up using just the right ammount would definately recommend it this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop simply plug it in and find the right drivers my only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic it does seem like it can break easily thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk all in all it works and i am pleased tested this on my blue yeti usb microphone and could tell the difference with the pop filter on right away good investment so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable very sturdy and awesome pop filter adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter i would recommend this to anyone i ordered two of these stands and they work very well definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
47	i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great it s got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too battery lasts for months well done behringer good quality cable and price works as good as those expensive dlls cables it does not make any noise i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value more expensive cables may be more rugged but for the price i m very happy with the hosa s i have purchased quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any ernie ball products great very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces i have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use the planet waves tri action capo features a trigger action which makes it easy to put on and remove compared with any other style of capo i ve ever used as the product description says it has a built in pick holder which certainly is not necessary but which is a feature that some users will find attractive if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing don t worry what looks like a spring actually is a spring the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that vise grips work this capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes and narrow neck standard acoustic guitars as well as acoustics with wider necks e g godin s seagull guitars the only quibble i have and it s a minor one is that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments once adjusted though the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz well what can i say based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a no brainer however after only months of light use used on my rig at home it is toast the cable barely holds a signal now constantly need to jiggle the thing to work and before you ask is it perhaps your output jack all of my other cables work with my gee tar so it is definitely the cable anyway i gave it stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc i have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus i have several bad habits including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or i drop it at some point on a bit of a lark i bought a pack of the clayton beeholds mm and really like them the hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required and i find the hole to be in a very natural feeling spot the pick is fairly long but i have not had any accuracy problems with them and so far durability has been good i still use other picks too but i really like these and can t imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand these great little accessories are a nice convenience the allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip this particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position older models would swivel without much effort bought to replace to older models i had on stage they ve worked out great the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands no spinning copasetic i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case i ve posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page the right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp i use a mogami silent cable mogami platinum guitar straight to straight with quiet plug feet for the input to my guitar but i can t justify paying a lot more money for the side that goes to my amp it s not getting bumped around plugged and unplugged etc this cable works perfect for it s purpose oh yeah and it matches my tweed amp this is a pretty strong cable i wanted something i can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case i m sitting on the amp the angle does the job seams strong seams like it will last so i have these old ev mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled these provided an easy inexpensive solution no complaints i m a professional musician playing times a month this pedal does far more than i need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles i really like the second looping function that s plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative don t forget to order the external power supply i would have happily paid a little extra money to have it included not sure why it s not double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would i haven t had a chance to play with customizing patches etc but i m sure that i ll be pleased with what it has to offer the pots on my bass has become scratchy so i sprayed a bit into them turn the pots back and forth a few times and no more noise great for what i needed
48	i ve had this little amplifier for a few weeks and i couldn t ask for a better practice amp it s amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room but it ll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds it s rugged and portable and it s fun to play around with some of the effects the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus there are several types of practice amps high end modlers line g dec vox vt that can still run and are typically overloaded with features the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v peavey valveking etc these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality and then there are the micros i always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas boy was i wrong i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear he s not a big kid so even lb amps are pushing it plus a gig bag and school back pack that was initially what brought me to the micro not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso turns out this is an amazing amp the tone destroys the line and the features crush the vox pathfinder watt or bug v and the fender frontman not even in the ballpark each of the models are distinct the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate obviously this isn t a loud amp but that s not all bad you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes it also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously for example i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy don t let the size fool you i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i couldn t have been more wrong there are several big websites and it s tough to find any negatives about this amp quality sounding and durable for a great price oh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too i always purchase grovers for my guitar straps but my gibson les paul standard plus had a bigger strap knob so i bought this dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly a good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system it is a fun little practice amp and i agree with the praise it gets the positives have been covered so i ll point out a few minor things i don t like first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying the rest of the controls are on top why do i have to grope around the back to find the most important button plus i keep it in a cabinet so i have to pull it out to turn it on and off next i wish they d just name the settings clean overdrive distortion and so on jc clean black panel brit combo and r fier mean nothing to me then there s another minor annoyance that the input is recessed a degree angle plug won t fit unless you run it around the back lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means it s heavy not heavy like i can t pick it up just heavy for something called a micro amp none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini i bought this amp to replace a squier sp that came with my guitar the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button i couldn t afford a bunch of pedals but i wanted some effects so i could get cool sounds from my electric guitar i saw the reviews for this little amp on amazon and decided to give it a try it is awesome for such a small amp the output is plenty loud for practicing at home and it runs on batteries too so i can take it anywhere the effects are better than i d hoped for this is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer but for an intermediate level guitarist like me who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family this is the amp to get it has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus flanger phaser or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay i m one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that i have the time i don t need the deafening stacks that the kids like i love this amp this is a very reasonable price for this bag i got it for my les paul epiphone uke the fit is fine this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke i ll just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesn t have one it came in nice packaging cable looks great feels of high quality so far it still works well ft is nice for home if you re a performer longer is required
49	a fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from a great deal for a nominal amount of money i sent it back probably due to my ignorance has multiple patterns to collect sound was a clear mike but i didn t detect any body to the sound maybe a preamp would have helped i checked out many mikes and ended up with a rode nt a which is probably similar in character my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars suspicious ratings to me now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out but since i found a good solution i don t think it s worth the effort this bag is light with two back pack straps a pocket for accessories excellent quality material and a good quality zipper if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it i love this thing action is perfect great sound good feel easy to play i highly recomend this
50	at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar too much noise with one spot this was way better lot of feature outlets can all be used to power either v or v pedals for each outlet just use the voltage selector switches to choose the voltage you need plug in your pedal and go outlet works the same way and gives you a similar choice except that it s between v and v outlets and may only be used one at a time if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise like outlets outlet gives you a choice between v and v outlet is a v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power isolated outputs delivering ma each centre pin is negative ac output at connector will power all pedals most of my pedals are to ma so potentially i could have plus pedals in a chain awesomeall the cables you needlike all t rex fuel tank power supplies your new chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter free once you ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play excellent don t even think about it just get it highly recommend it i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present so far so good you can t beat the price thanks this case it built really well it has really nice plush interior storage area for picks strings tuning fork etc in the neck it does have a lock on one of the latches the case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key so dont worry just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it above all it fits my epi lp perfectly as it should hehe this is accurate and can be used for many different purposes it is durable and can be used while playing works like the picture shows hangers adjust to required width of head stock wood finish is nice look on the wall hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty i m very satisfied with the quality of this case as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected this case is the best i ve ever had very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong the handle extreamly soft to the touch i guess all my other cases just don t measure up to this one it even locks if your guitar fits but this for the quality the case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be the pocket inside is nice for holding accessories it does include a lock on the middle latch but somehow mine eventually stopped working as the lock isn t very good quality the lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used otherwise great case highly recommended i bought these when i had to re tube my marshall jcm kk head this is the only tube head i have played or had so i really cant tell you how they compare to other brands but these things rock they are very good for metal hard rock and have lasted a year now while gigging and practicing weekly i was recommended to jj by a friend who only uses them and i will likely be doing the same i paired them with the jj kt s and these things just rock it s a simple strap button don t know what else to say i can t imagine a strap button not serving it s purpose i hate minimum word review requirements i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks i could not believe the quality of this case fits my epiphone les paul like a glove very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable i was really looking forward to receiving this amp i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight unfortunately from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser like effect to the sound i tried different basses with it i tried different cables with it i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase shifter sound came out i tried all different knob and eq settings as well nothing helped so i m returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don t think less of ampeg at least not yet i really hope it s a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful for it s packed with cool features like an effects send a cd in a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice it also just looks cool and very pro my intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here i have to say buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label if there is a choice between amazon com and other vendors and even if amazon is a couple bucks more i recommend using amazon the customer service is so easy and immediate it s worth the piece of mind i ll update this review when i get the new amp later this week i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received see below
51	wawa pedals come and go and get modded and re thunk but i always wanted an original cry baby so this was a birthday gift to myself not disappointed down the road i may add some of the gazillions of electronic mods available now to personalize the sound but for the time being i m gonna enjoy this pedal as shipped very good buy great packaging earlier than expected delivery thanks amazon if all you re looking for is an inexpensive way to hang your guitar until you can afford a good quality leather strap this is it the quality and function of the strap is actually better than i expected for the amount paid as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more if you re toating between practice with an instructor it s okay i purchased it for that reason and i m an adult so i can be careful this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent dirt but that s it there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price use very little of this rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off it also lubes your strings good all around product this bag is light with two back pack straps a pocket for accessories excellent quality material and a good quality zipper if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it this is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere one note this does not come with any picks one customer said it did but mine did not it has a sticky pad on the back and sticks well to a wood guitar i even moved it once and it still sticks fine it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out when i sit down to practice my guitar i just want something very simple to keep time it was a pain previously to have to mess with menus and such on a computer to bring up a metronome app from tablet phone or computer with this i ll just have to flip a switch and dial the tempo that i want simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines i do recommend this one
52	rugged robust flexible couldn t ask for more in a momentary switch like all boss products it will probably last longer than me i got this for my boss loop station but it doesn t work very well i keep hoping i ll find something it does work well with it s d addario you can t go wronggreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thanks i m using this footswitch to control a drum machine it does the job and i ve had no problems with it i put them on a dipinto mach v with that levis rat fink guitar strap i need to exchange i use this on all my guitars i tried some off brands and i ve found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon t leave home without itbut take and extra button battery
53	cheap quick and easy it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive it s almost painful i haven t had it break and it doesn t cause any issues with the instrument so i m more than content with this handy inexpensive capo i bought a set of these from amazon s warehouse deals page with a discount because of some expected damage they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise i was expecting some damage to the items but hoping that between the of them that i would be able to salvage enough to put together one full stand i bought these because i needed only stand with good height on it for mounting my lcd hitachi flat screen to it i use this tv in my studio so that everyone can see what s going on when we record and work on music i needed something that was going to be sturdy and hold the tv high enough that everyone in the studio would be able to see it all the time both stands showed up in good and working condition they go up to about tall and are perfect for mounting speakers onto although i use it to mount my tv about ceiling height which is about the same weight as my speakers if not more they work great i m going to add some pictures of my creation when i get around to it give me about a month this is not my first guitar nor am i breathless epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of taylors and martins it s not here s what it is an exceedingly well constucted amazingly playable guitar fit finish feel and action were all very nice sound on the other hand let s face it it s plywood all around it sounds like plywood but that doesn t distract from the fact that it s a great guitar for bucks it s a fine first guitar it s a great beach camping cabin guitar leave it in your car to practice at lunch leave it in the office any guitar is better than no guitar and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box new premium strings do make a difference if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you won t be disappointed if sound quality is your primary concern well you are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy for my desired application this guitar was great i m very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat they are good quality guitar picks and i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for some guitar picks this is a good product its not the best strap but for what i paid for it its well worth it ive had it for about a month and so far it seems to be holding up very well this is a great product for a beginer these lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them my other review was for the heavier gauge cobalts but these sound just as good regardless of p strat single coil or humbucker great tone sustain and flexibility i am sold on any cobalt gauge head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and i have tried them all
54	my friend has commented on its bright color you ll never lose that thing i hope he s right cause i love this little tuner works well and easier to read than many of its competitors i ve owned this and a couple of other korge tuners in the past and currently own three in the past i would use a keyboard to get the bottom e on my guitar and take it from there these days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive i keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when i go out with my guitars i also use it to tune my violin and it works great if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better over all for the cost you can t go wrong these used to be expensive none essentials but today they re small accurate and portable i tried this but ended up going back to tortex i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid nice grip sound articulate durable nice i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite i bought gauges both are going to be used for years got to admit i was a little intimidated by the installation process when i was shopping for this pickup but when i got the box i was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions not too long not too short along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly the jig method is super easy and provided great results i was really excited to try out the pickup so i plugged it into my roland ac and let her rip it was awsome very full and very representative of my guitars sound k k you have a convert in me i am now thinking about trying this on my martin unquestionably a top of the line manual string winder but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar s headstock on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy for now i ll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb it s a fender heavy so there s not much else to say about that good price and selection here go for it very nice cable i used this with my planet waves v adapter it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful the onespot adapter itself would probably be even better as it only takes one place on a power strip etc instead of a chunky old school adapter like the planet waves style really nice product for the price i ve used the tortex picks for a while now and have been really happy with them this pick however takes it to the next level very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick i use the for acoustic and the same holds true great product
55	great all round pick one of my favorites easy to grip and are pretty quite they wear out extremely fast though i only use dunlops for a number of reasons first the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions two thumbs up use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick i use the mm mm and mm sizes great strings used them for years always loved them put them on an eric johnson strat wouldn t use anything low quality for that guitar this product is excellent cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue made my little martin look almost as good as new nice wide lip sturdy appears to be well made and durable nice finish on it hopefully will last a long time i bought these guitar picks for my son he really likes them a lot i would definitely buy them again
56	put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a great tough i could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here i like the fact that it can be partially installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole which will have to be enlarged a bit either way once plugged in it sounds great this pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a blueridge br i installed some fishman under the saddle pickups in a few martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good if not better if you don t mind the pickup visible in the sound hole this is the way to go another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar this is not a bad product just not great as soon as i received it i installed it on my custom made grit laskin guitar and played with it for over two hours installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes my problems with it are fold sounds just a bit tinny too much on the high end and not an equal amount of bass a small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries and i couldn t get mine to work in passive mode and the biggest complaint is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you re performing on stage you have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft like i said it is not a bad product just not top notch and definitely not for professionals if you re just fooling around at home or recording at home it is fine and will do the job for you but if you re a pro you ll want to spend double the money and get an l r baggs m the m gives you the truest sound unbelievable works in passive mode and is very easy to change the volume control sincerely doc quiet and durable i was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all i expected i use it for practice and recording myself i really like it but for the price i wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect i have it on my martin d which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good
57	ok here s the deal i m just a small home studio type of guy and honestly i wasn t expecting much when i shelled out the for this mic i have just always seen it around and i thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi pattern mic the first time i recorded with it i had it on omni mode and played some acoustic it sounded amazing i can t believe this mic is that good crisp clean sound who cares if it s made in china like that one guy says and very flexible usage i ve since used it on toms acoustic a room mic for amps and even some background vocals and it has shined every time so if you re like me and looking for a low price ldc with multiple patterns get this you won t be disappointed at all these really do work great no more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now i do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my monitors if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know thanks i m using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface unfortunately these angle the speakers down by default so i had to do some cutting and rearranging but it worked out if you need to cut these to fit your speakers try to find something better than scissors because it s quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them this mic stand is a great value this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed i bought a few years back and it s still working amazing till this day if you re purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands just make sure that your mic comes with a shock mount because the stand tends to move a little but other than that it s a great buy very good quality cable and plugs easy to make custom length cables from inches to ft my pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that i actually made room for more because there was no extra wire to get in the way just what i needed for my home studio monitors that sit on the table next to my computer and my daw system was surprised at how many different versions i was sent they all work well thanks heaps besides that fact that they are quality cables the colors are pretty dope and really stand out nicely in the studio
58	good strings they work and sound good i didn t notice much of a difference between these and run of the mill d addario strings i picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit it does a wonderful job of that drive set low and the level set high tone set to taste the additional noise it produces is relatively low so you won t have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with as with any other boss pedals it s well made and reliable there was nothing wrong with my original neckplate but i was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra it was a direct replacement for the original i have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear bright yet robust sound and i found that in the martin msp sp strings i knew i had found my strings after a short time playing with these they are light on the fingers sound great and priced right
59	i bought this because i wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short i m pleasantly surprised with this cable it s decent sound and decent build quality for a good price these are good strings for a good price i have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time these strings retain a good feeling for a long time well past the point of them needing changed because they ve lost brightness nothing that spectacular really it did it s job was easy for my husband to use made me able to use a strap on my guitar nice solid no frills guitar strap i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot brand name good string good tone seem to last awhile but i change strings often so never really know how long a set will last i use these on my fender strat and they sound great if you appreciate the talent of david gilmour and respect his taste and choices in music than i would recommend these strings i used to use elixir strings and as great as elixir sound they do not last long these do i have played guitar for over years and i am very happy with these strings i had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply this rosin is great because it s encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin it s so easy to apply and doesn t leave any messy residue on my fingers i haven t been playing the violin for very long but did know i needed something to rosin the bow easily this was exactly what i needed this keyboard sounds good but the inability to go below that low e is just killing me the speakers are good buy a good sustain pedal m audio sp sustain pedal with piano style action for keyboards
60	when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion but when i got it and played with it i figured out it was alot different that advertised it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal it s got an attitude but it soft at the same time it s truly a one of a kind product i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal make a note it is not a metal pedal not by any means actually but for what it is it is fantastic i was surprised of how well this stand is made it s worth easily i ve used stands for over years and this is the best i ve owned long story short this string set has a strong metallic character which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo i have a seagull guitar so by its nature it sounds mellow warm and mild with stock strings so when my strings wear out i got this now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my fender archtop s neck position without the power that an emg pickup has to offer yes it is that bad you can t do this to guitars like seagulls bottom line i recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string if your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings these are a littl ehard to play i don t use it for any heavy use i use it for podcasting purposes haven t had any problems so i can t speak to really heavy use of the product the graphtech pq c tusq fully compensated acoustic guitar saddle will replace any broken or worn saddle to give you a very food sound that may require just a little sanding to make it fit perfect for your guitar this is a good durable mount i like the look of it as well as the light weight feel not much else to be said
61	these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my strat good sustain and strings are holding up well works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor the strap wouldn t hold my guitar any longer i wanted something cheap something that don t require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it i was worried about damaging my guitar so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly arrived on time packaged well happy with purchase they are your regular picks will order again if needed happy with purchase hope you enjoy em they work as well as any dunlop pick they don t crack which is a big plus if you use the general fender variety i go a little thicker than i would for regular plastic picks because they get flimsy after a while take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store i have owned this product for a while now it has some awesome features this little recorder is absolutely amazing for it s size takes some practice to appreciate all the features i recommended this recorder to a fellow musician friend he bought one also from amazon he loves it records all his gigs with it now instead of the old huge unit he was using told me it does a much better job than his old unit he even used his on a tripod to record a gravesite funeral service that his family can keep for memories of a loved one i have used monster cables for years and with good reason the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone simple fact cables break but getting to replace them at no cost is where it s at after using d addario strings i ve try to ernie ball strings i have ten years ago with ernie ball strings and let me tell you that it s the best strings in comparison with regular slinky this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk clasical rock and indie sound i have an stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one you can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag this mute allows me to practice without annoying my family and does not harm the violin it seems well made great picks for beginners and pros alike go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing i ve tried pretty much every harp out there after having played the regional blues jazz circuit for about years lee oskar harps are the best value on top of it lee oskar actually called me once just because i left a question on his website i ve met rick epping of hohner harmonicas at namm great guy but he never called me at in the afternoon just because i could not identify a song i thought he was playing on i carry around between or harps to a gig so that is at least for a set of lee oksar harps suzuki manji harps while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great would cost nearly presuming you could find them i will not say i ve never blown a reed on a lo but i will say that for a new set of lo reed plates beats for a new manji at least in my book on top of it all they really did with the manji is discontinue the bushman delta frost harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price lee oskar harmonicas are inexpensive they are simple and cheap to repair easy to play have great tone and are even easy to identify since the st nd position keys are printed right on the comb that feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet give them a shot i got this amp recently at a local store and so far im loving it i also aqcuired the mkii foot controller and is a perfect combination tons of sounds and it can be edited to fit your demands nice volume coming out of it also for watts it seems more recommended i picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit it does a wonderful job of that drive set low and the level set high tone set to taste the additional noise it produces is relatively low so you won t have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with as with any other boss pedals it s well made and reliable this capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar it does not break and is very sturdy highly recommended these dunlop straploks are amazing never had them fail on me and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home they stay secure when done properly i ve looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work and work well i ve been playing guitar for over years and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i v ever used they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity clack noise dunlop ultex picks sound much better although the quality is obviously not that of a studio this guy serves it s purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it i use it when i mess around in garageband and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment it s also very easy to use and the usb cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus i was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great they have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great it s almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these it sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers you don t want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition i ve been using the same straploks on all my guitars for the past years i have not had one fail on me ever just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it s on right i ve struggled with the c clip in the past but what are you going to do it s a one time thing when you first install so it s no biggie once you get the hang of this capo it s wonderful it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension i have several guitars but the one that i love using this capo on has a hard v neck it s pretty accurate on that neck up to the th fret nice product worth the investment now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it there is a lot to think about with a strap lock is it sturdy reliable does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar can it fit in a case or does it make you take the strap off every time you put your guitar away the fender schaller design covers all of these bases well i believe it is sturdy and reliable unlike it s dunlop competition the stress on the guitar is roughly equivalent to plain strap buttons it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many i ve switched over to this design and couldn t be happier with it note i advise using a crescent wrench and a socket to tighten the nut one always wants to avoid over tightening but the risk of under tightening is high without proper leverage if you don t really tighten the nut down you are likely to have things fall apart while playing some day this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised it s just that it gets in the way for me and my chording skills mounted as designed and shown i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well i feel that it s a good deal and recommend it i used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from paul gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of mm these things are great and yes i can shred faster now if you thought a pick is a pick like i once did long ago you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and or complexity i use the dunlop tortex mm purples early on in my playing i was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better why after messing about i found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack the interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard with a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility i tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid s i like the dunlops feel grip and durability they hold up for a very long time how long i have had some last a few years they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability my students use them too i don t demand it but i do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges highly recommended you won t be disappointed been using these cables for three months now i use them with azoom g n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research i found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time they have a good lenght of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you ll be playing so far i ve only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig i ve got coming up the end of the month not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar i ve used these picks for years with great results if you ve never used this stile picks you won t be sorry these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice its nice and easy to use secures the strings very good and works for all types of guitars with no issues there s nothing not to like about this capo i have two of them i ve played guitar for over years and have used other types of capos i like this one s low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard by turning a knob to tighten it rather than rely on a spring as on the clip on type it takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip on type but i like the results better i have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body people watching me can t really see it and it s right where i need it full of picks if i drop one wonderful little invention buy it if you don t want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket i ve been playing guitar for years and lately i ve been wanting some slinkier strings so i can get a little more bend out of them i thought i d try these out and i loved them after playing with these for a week i loved the way that they played and i loved the way they sound so i ordered more packs of these the extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely won t find a better set of strings for the money this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals i know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones highly recommended plays sounds feels and looks great also comes with a little note sheet quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather does exactly what it s says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price as a kid i learned to play the trombone proficiently but my heart wasn t really in it so i took up the guitar which i love i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time i recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock i have an old ibanez and a les paul custom and have tried several picks in that quest there are several i have liked and several that i haven t but thus far my favorite is the mm tortex blue picks they have a very nice almost powdery matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don t break though the s are fairly stiff depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences i won t say that i will never try anything else but thus far i find myself picking up my tortex more than other picks i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks they are so grippy i haven t broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so it s hard to loose them but i still do if you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while you re playing they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the mm picks for that worked for me got no complaints over these very smooth and lasted me a while love ernie ball strings they are the only ones i get i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now it s time to treat myself with this gift so i don t have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china it s very rare thing to see now a days this pedal does exactly what my title suggests it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz very smashing pumpkins feel to this it doesn t do many different tones but what it does it does very well and frankly once i find a good tone out of a pedal i don t change it often anyhow this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards p s i have the russian variant these have always been my favorite strings and i ve just about tried them all everything from elixirs fenders gibson dunlop and everything in between i always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky they are a set of s overall great strings never had a break on me last long sound pretty good too this cable works fine i m going to buy a pair in january i used it live and they are really great durable and it feel s pro try one i have always used tortex picks i like them a lot and they last forever almost these were a little thick for my tastes the red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns if you like a medium thick pick though these are rockin you won t get ac tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your amp sorta like buying a wah flanger or other product this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone problem is is that you won t replicate a vox sound found on a classic rock album because what you are producing is a unique sound i have yet to try this through a loop
62	my friend has commented on its bright color you ll never lose that thing i hope he s right cause i love this little tuner works well and easier to read than many of its competitors i ve had one of these for about years have gigged with it extensively and i ve only had to replace it once more on that later i m not really a cork sniffer re guitar tone i think most of our tone comes from our fingers and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me i think this monster cable sounds fine better well better than what i don t really notice a difference when i use different cables maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies but it s so slight as to be negligible i look for guitar cables that will last that s what i really care about and so far this monster cable does the trick i use other brands too this is my most expensive cable but i think it was worth the i spent all those years ago oh and the return process this was maybe years ago i called monster they gave me their address and i had to pay about to ship it back to them about weeks later i had a new cable i consider that to be excellent customer service i d first like to say that i bought this guitar on amazon for about a lot cheaper than it s being sold now currently it s a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solidbody but it looks a little different than the picture would lead you to believe for one the guitar doesn t have a finish not even a glossy clearcoat it s solidbody wood sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain secondly the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is the photo shows it looking almost like a red colored wood in reality it s a much darker deep brown akin to coffee this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful i have a bit of buzzing on one fret but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish the guitar can also be strung and tuned easily though with any guitar of this body style you ll have to continually tune and retune until the strings will keep a tuning it s a very heavy sturdy guitar and for a solidbody with two humbuckers you ll likely not find one that sounds as meaty and smooth i bought these because i wanted durable flexible picks for easy strumming i would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming i only use dunlops for a number of reasons first the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions two thumbs up use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick i use the mm mm and mm sizes pros records excellent audio through built in mics records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile i love the track ability and the effects built in to the device i can record multiple things in less time especially when i m just messing around to get a feel for a song comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box cons battery life is weak built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want this cable seems top notch to me some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting of course those guys abuse their equipment maybe that will be something i ll encounter but this cable appears to be very well made and it works great i take very good care of my gear so i expect this one to last only gave it four out of five because i d rate some other cables slightly higher this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and i d buy another they re very thin nylon picks they re good for practicing the hand motions of strumming they put up very little resistance so they train you to keep your hand stable i still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone but i usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums i also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don t notice with a thicker pick they re great for what they are thin flexible picks and amazon has the best price cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and don t break end up losing them verses breaking this mm is a bit soft for my liking will go a size thicker next time these just don t have the right feel and the sound isn t that great compared to other materials the quality control is so so the picks aren t cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them i ll stick with dunlop gator grip mm or prs picks for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks it holds about to picks pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate would recommend i ve used the mm and mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career i rock hard acoustic electric and bass i ve tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily dunlop s nylon picks don t break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs you ll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming maybe times in my entire career buy these picks im not loyal to brands on the whole but when i reach for a pick i hope this is the one i get they wear out and get nicks so i have to remember to keep ordering them edit watch the steve vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn nicked picks rapidly firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet the motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick repeat or times and whadda u know the edge is now smooth and nice sometime round my friend kendal built several of these for our band they were great and incredibly handy i havent investigated this but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not certainly if he did he never patented it or anything anyway flash forward years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes resenting batteries and individual power supplies i thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again and so i did this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters so far it has lived up to my expectations i cat speak to playing out with this yet as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose so for such a simple device you really cant beat it unless you dont really use boxes personally i presently have my wah distortion chorus overdrive delay slap echo and flanger running through it everything works great enjoy i bought this for an accousic guitar then i had to have one for a mandolin and now i also have one for a square neck dobro some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don t leave much room for a leather strap some case manufacturers have the same problem this item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap the dobro had the issue with the strap didn t have a great connector it claims to stop string talk when you rub fingers on wound strings it doesn t but it does reduce it somewhat and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long or playing a new song over and over i gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips seems to help my callouses without messing them up and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists i ve been playing for about years now and have used many different brands an types of pick there is no perfect pick for everything depending on what your playing and your playing style you ll want to choose different thickness and materials however i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor i also really like the nylon material it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar i like the playability of the mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues i keep a stack of mm for a more raw folk like sound in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be i love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly the tuner picks up vibrations so it doesn t require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar there s just one button so it s idiot proof however the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soon speaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but i hate that they used the cr battery it just doesn t last long and in brazil it s really hard to find this battery at all i only use elixirs on my taylor now because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing and because they are super smooth it s like playing a silk guitar get these strings fantastic strap nope it isn t leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff but it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my cc ot banjo that has a really tight spacing all the others i tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass once again extremely comfortable and sturdy so had to buy another so i can just have one on each this nylon pick has great play feel it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords it didnt hold as many i as thought it only holds but that didnt matter now i finaly have some where to put my picks so i dont lose them the pick holder also has a sticky thing at the bottom so you can stick it to your guitar or somthing
63	good design easy to hang on to these picks reasonable price makes it even better i don t often use picks but when i do i use these i will buy more in the future these are really cheap strings but how they sound really good obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse these are the ones i only use dunlops for a number of reasons first the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions two thumbs up use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick i use the mm mm and mm sizes i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f and they look stunning the tone seems slightly brighter however i go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference i am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings since they are replacing plastic pins i am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective sounds good these pins are a little thin small so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing if you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins this may not be necessary however even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole the string should go all the way through the hole into the body of the guitar insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches if possible it should be listing toward the neck then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin the pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole if you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you re trying to get your guitar in tune typically ruining a brand new string in the process if you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body correctly or hanging on the pin incorrectly also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation these fit my guitar snugly but not tightly however i do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that i do a lot of string bending a whole step or more sometimes using two fingers strength to bend that far overall i am quite pleased with these ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early s they have never let me down very comfortable in the hand
64	these mics are great i wasn t sure what they would be like but i would buy them all again they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time these have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all finally a product that is as simple to use as a point and shoot camera literally i opened the box put in two batteries the memory card read the quick start guide put the zoom on the included stand and got out my mandolin and started recording the sound quality is great and you can play it back directly on the zoom by plugging in some head buds included the control buttons operate like a dvd remote with a menu button using the fast forward and reverse to scroll through entries and the record button as the set for someone who is not well versed in audio terminology gain sampling rates mics pre post amps levels whatever i just set it to medium gain watched to make sure the lines don t go too far up and was recording away in two steps push record to test the gain level and push record again red light stays on to record and push record to stop the file is saved and then you can push play pause to listen back deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a vcr you can use this puppy it is also handy portable and easy to take places i will take it to record jam sessions music lessons and practice to evaluate my playing and instrument comparisons the sound quality is great and i could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is i wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise finger slide noise and other assorted twangs and twings it records both in wav huge files and mp compressed with various quality levels to choose from you can easily connect it to a computer windows mac with the included usb cable the only thing missing is a remote since you have to push the button on the recorder you have to move to it to activate deactivate it also picks up noise from your movements but for the price it s a real gem i always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise doesn t cost a lot and delights the customer on this one it is the included wind sock a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording cool the best strings i ever bought and i ve bought them all i got these for my electric and the ej p acoustic electric for my acoustic they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy this is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify foot stomping percussion traditional to french canadian music the base is really heavy which makes it stay in place well but it s a pain to carry around also since buying this i found out that i could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet which would have been a bit cheaper i ve used the mm and mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career i rock hard acoustic electric and bass i ve tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily dunlop s nylon picks don t break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs you ll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming maybe times in my entire career buy these picks the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion it does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but i d keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner if you value your guitar not a specific knock on the hercules but most low and portable stands like this are the same they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down you may be careful around it but it s hard to say for others nearby for a cheap guitar i wouldn t mind using this but for a more expensive guitar no thanks please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i ve used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect very easy to grip and last long one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind highly recommand this for anyone needs pick as a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal holy grail of guitar picks i am no exception dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the dollar picks you name it i ve tried it even nail picking on metal strings now if you are new to the perfect pick quest you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your grail different however if you play a light metal string acoustic my main is an aria af tenor guitar check out these dunlops nylons even within the dunlop line i have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same gage didn t acoustically perform quite the same would i try another pick if the chance was presented sure most of us would since the quest for the holy grail never truly ends but until then dunlop s nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection a good value box set of quality products use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy
65	i think many most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try my favorite picks for the last years are snarling dogs brain picks they re nylon picks that have a raspy cat s tongue surface that makes it super easy to grip i ve also had a few of these gator grip picks for a few years now and i like them quite a bit but they re not my favorite i tend to use something around or just under mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic these picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them sound wise i don t find that they re significantly different from any other pick if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints dust oxidation squeaks or gummy areas or drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new i don t like greasy feeling products on my guitars so dr duck ax wax is designed for my needs i threw out my gibson spray too oily dr ducks wax is worth the extra this bottle will last a lifetime you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish if you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about then this kit is for you changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me but i see that most are the same as a pop filter it works perfectly and i was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring just pop filtering through black pantyhose lol i use the mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years the non slip surface doesn t take long to wear off but i have a work around i ve even put them in a vice and filed new points on them i prefer an extra heavy pick because there s no delay from pick deflection i bought a number of these because after the first one i used i fell in love they have a fuller sound than other picks and the grip on these is fool proof however they don t pinch harmonics well at all and they will not do scrapes up the low strings at all two disasters for classic rock music i never seen picks that wouldn t do these things however i really struggled with these things that seem so easy with other picks however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks these just sound flat in comparison to elixir nanowebs and they don t feel as good either i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings since they were named gator grip i expected them to have a good gripping surface that was not the case the entire material and holding surface is the same material also they weren t as large as i expected they are still usable as decent picks these have been my favorite pick for years now but i must say that they are not real pointy and i have recently been trying some pointier pick and i m now on the fence i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing and it seems to have made my fingertips slick so i have a hard time holding on to picks when i use them on upstrokes i m sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem but it s more fun to blame the pick these picks were no different from picks without the gator grip imho but gorilla snot worked beautifully
66	i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them i generally use a dunlop m pick but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play this of course can be very annoying especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song these big stubby picks have solved that problem they are easy to hold onto great for leads and because of the way they are shaped don t hang on to the strings like the regular picks do great picks definitely worth the little extra they cost i m happy with this used it to replace the blown speaker from a yr old w roland cube amp a bass player used the amp and i think it was too much for the speaker next time i ll use the pa for the bass player much better sound perfect fit etc keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey type sound i believe it has those using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp i have tryed a number of pick s and the textured ones seem to work for me i have dexdarity problems regular pick s without grips come out of my hands cause i am unable to control them so i needed something with a little more weight to it allthough my fingures want to move around a little bit i love these picks now i can move my thumb and index fingers back to the bottom of the pick and it feels comfortable i used to do that with other non textured pick s and i kept droping them these pick s are a must have allso sinse theire heavier then other pick s these and the ice pick s really build up your hand s and finger s i love these pick s im defintley getting some more they are half the size of a regular pick bit too thick for me sound nice will last forever wish i had sized them before i bought them i ve been playing guitar for over twenty years now and i ve tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these elixir coated strings i ve come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it eventually all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn t make any sense if you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what i do is i get the least expensive ones and make sure i wipe down and clean them even using products like string cleaners and fast fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the u s and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names granted elixir probably isn t one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price i myself use generic kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and memphis electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest i could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way in fact you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings at least most people would be able to hear the difference don t get me wrong these elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique practice getting better cables pickups amps guitars etc than from just using these strings for better string life just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use this discipline once a habit is good enough peace best string capo i have ever used and that s over decades works easily and flawlessly very well made five stars if you re worried that the mm is too big for your guitar you re probably right if you don t use a pick for your bass then you don t want this either but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely tuned them down to a sharp b flat and they sounded sweet back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone this little stand collapses and sets up so easy holds my guitar perfectly may buy one for my dad next currently my favorite pick it s thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle i d recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like i generally use d addario with my acoustic guitar only but i decided to try it out on the electric and i am very satisfied it has the same light feel as their acoustic product but it can make all the sweet tones i want it to when hooked up to an amp i m not sure on how long it lasts because i only put them on the guitar a few days ago but they seem just as perfect as they were when i put them on i would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me another item never received but i would not use anything over mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase the right pick is a personal preference nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick but it s not for me i bought a pack of mm picks last year and loved them but left them in florida when i went north i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk and the item pictured is nylon i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks obviously they weren t they re as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but it s still not too bad i decided to try out the m in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board while i haven t explored all of the sounds yet i have found some useable ones you really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation also factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much here are some that i ve personally found to be appealing so far delay analog w mod a nice sounding memory man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalreverb room standard adjustable digital delay not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicenvelope filter tron up a winner fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky synthy seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes octave bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers you will also find as expected with a multi effects pedal many unpractical downright silly sounding noise makers not to say you won t find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we re talking about a headphones session also don t depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you re using it as an addition to your amp s lead channel construction seems pretty sturdy other than the model select button which is a multi use knob with push down turn action and is cheapy cheap it s awkward and uncomfortable to use fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets having the choice between true bypass and dsp is a really nice touch and unheard of on stomp boxes as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position i do miss my korg pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually the m is serving that purpose the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package how a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesn t seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what i like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isn t always possible with that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding jim dunlop s purple colored big stubby mm picks i like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the big stubby certainly meets that criteria the sharp point and the pick s rounded edges help the stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking besides electric guitar i find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semi solid body guitars where the string tension is greater i had tried the mm stubby previously but the mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all i m still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly i find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky keeping the pick clean and dry does help my favorite pick had been thedunlop mm nylon pick but i am very pleased with the performance and feel of the mm stubby i can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick the pick pack contains picks i only paid which is simply an outstanding deal if you re a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty stubby a try using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks you simply play faster no matter what level you are alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat pick drag now i only use flat picks for acoustic play when i want to hear the crunch picks in a pack is an insane bargain you pay twice as much in a store
67	i started experimenting on strings i ll try using bronze strings i noticed when i was using the phosphor bronze after a while it started to sound dull when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer i decided i would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time i would recommend others to try it one of the strap buttons on a guitar i was given as a gift was missing i was told that it would need some minor repairs so all i had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it this strap button was screwed right in the minute i got it and it worked like a charm i put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn t given me any problems this tabletop mic stand works well designed and made from descent enough materials i would buy again when i m ready to replace the one i have or add to it it s kinda small for my hand but it works great it s more easier to pick the string this pack comes with picks i ve been using only these even since trying them wonderful picks for speed and precision you won t go back for sure very nice leather strap i will like it better when it is worn in and softer but excellent for holding the weight of a five string bass i very much recommend it along with some dunlop straploks i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked they don t play at all like what i was expecting under high magnification the edge doesn t look the same as the old jazz iii either and they don t play the same if you turn them over what s up with that i m sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop let s hope this is just a short term fluke i love these strings they sound awesome on my acoustic however they do not last long but that is the price you pay for a good sound not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller not my first intellitouch tuner i really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar the first thing i do when i get a new instrument is put a straplok on it before gigging with it they re easy to install i haven t had one fail on me yet i have straploks on nine instruments right now and i just ordered another for my new bass i can t recommend them highly enough
68	its ok it does what it says but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time one of my favorite picks i ve tried for electric don t enjoy them as much on acoustic i dont know why they are called big stubby they are on the small side way to thick for me they do sound good though and will last a long time i feel like i am playing with a nickle i like the indentation helps the grip a lot i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness still looking for the right picks for me if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again this is the first and only tc electronic product i ve ever purchased i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard it has exceeded my expectations the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak the toneprint feature is amazing i downloaded church of andy preset from the tce website and just love that patch downloading is quick and easy i created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available hall of fame patches so whenever i want to change it out i don t even have to go on the internet to get it there is an iphone ipod gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal don t ask me how it works but it does i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future i like dunlop products i used the purple tortex mm almost exclusively until i met up with this jazz iii and now my personal debate continues i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is i like tortex and this isn t but i really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it i rarely and i do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times they make or picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips this is the new and improved jazz style pick and i am still trying to figure out if i like this or the trad fender jazz pick or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn t such a bad idea after all i have large hands i wear an xxl glove but i guess not thick fingers ring size if you want to use this one on your ring finger consider getting a smaller size as for the tone of the slide it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass had no issues in the months there is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your real picks which helps with its looks i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar the rubber makes it easy to hold onto and i feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well the title says it all it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks also since these picks are smaller i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review if amazon used half stars i would have given them i just couldn t bring myself to give them a so i went with here s why i ve used standard medium picks for over years switching to these was not a problem at all sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems by far the biggest change was the pointy ness of the picks the distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing especially when playing chords everything is much more pronounced which isn t necessarily a good thing in my opinion it s especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming if someone was to ask me if these are good picks my answer would be it depends it really does in my opinion it depends on what you re playing from a rhythm standpoint i don t like these at all they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me for lead work they are ok because you can really dig into each note and have it come through could i play faster with them no could i pull off amazing licks that i couldn t do with my normal picks no i tried them but didn t like them maybe if you typically play a ton of lead work constantly these would be the way to go i don t and they aren t for me i m glad i tried them though because i ll never wonder again if they were for me
69	i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably in fact they were so good that i purchased ten more when i went back to the same music store my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs the round side of the xh dunlop gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone i would recommend these to anyone like the title says ive been using these for years used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with i either use the s or the s and detune them got what i paid for worth the money definitely sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can done they play well and hold up well never had one break they are my second favorite pick but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick it s not a bad pick i will continue to use them but i wish they had a softer center or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers
70	the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables ft measurement worked perfectly you really will not be disappointed with these i love these pick holders they re easy to get on and off they hold a nice amount of picks and you get that rock star feel throw picks at the audience a must for any gigging guitarist the ultimate guitar cleaning tool i love love love this kit i ve been using the products for years and i ve been nothing but happy with their quality i ve always used planet waves nails but i wanted to try the dunlop buying me this little package a very good experience durable comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks it is quite tight on my picks but i imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used i could not be happier once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark just get snark yes it costs considerably more than the sm and i m not sure if i could pass a comparison test between the two but i love this mic to me it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the s i have used in the past if you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet get the if you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost go for the beta i would buy this again i m pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years i haven t found a wireless unit that i feel comfortable with on stage yet i was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until i purchased these at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too they last forever definitely worth the money this pop filter is great it looks and performs like a studio filter if you re recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing this is an attractive leather head stock strap the leather is very soft and flexible i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather in my band we have a song where i use a kazoo for one song and i needed a way to store it until needed this cup holder does the trick it also holds my water bottle with no problem the problem is it doesn t do both at the same time that s on me this is a good product for what it does
71	if you can t find a container and add your own sponge then buy this keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential i think this item should cost three bucks at most and would still yield a healthy profit i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better i use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughts if you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood excellent product simple and practical design holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone if humidity levels in your area go below you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks planet waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting dampen the sponge squeeze out excess water insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp couldn t be any easier i use them all winter long in my guitars yup it s o k nothing special i don t know if it s the best one out there but it does the job this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe if you don t over fill it will not drip and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge scratch free durable machine washable i use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much much longer you place the cloth next to a string then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces sides and top of the string then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times then repeat on the remaining strings i then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys takes a matter of moments and works great then once every week or two it just goes in with the laundry comes out perfectly clean again polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric it is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface but it works well for polishing if i m using carnuba wax i use a cotton towel to remove it but for dry polishing wouldn t be without one for each guitar fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands if you have the smaller screw headed ends on your microphone stand you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing maybe a dollar if they don t just give it to you using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out getting in the way plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera the set screw presses against a ball socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile i am very careful not to over tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing but at this price i guess you can t expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism eh there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a degree preset angle the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera be careful the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras i found a little plastic threaded washer like ring that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc to hold it in place when in storage or transport you could also leave it attached to your camera either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost overall the little thing is quite solid heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small basic solid and inexpensive it holds well when bumped or moved mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose i would not put a larger sized mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter most modern devices will do just fine again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well don t put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years mine has i m happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas hope this helps i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick my guitar would probably not be happy without it after trying about every comp out there for years i came across this i have a wampler ego compressor too it is the same quality as the ego compressor better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me it s simple basic but i don t think it does that good of a job this is because it doesn t really humidify that much and doesn t extend very far into the guitar these are fine but didn t fit well but they are a quality product in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight i ve been playing guitar more than years and have used a lot of electronic tuners the first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use the planet waves pw ct is my new favorite it is very small a little bit larger than a grape despite some of the other reviews i have used it with good results on a strat tele les paul and es electrics and on acoustics from martin gibson national resophonic and voyage air i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low e tuner i didn t expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock i have to read it upside down the pw ct is nicely out of the way even when i play an f chord with my thumb on the low e string it s so light i don t notice it s there the display is bright and easy to see in most light a bit hard to read in direct sunlight but i do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway the display is small a dime can cover most of it but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position the sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it no flat symbol bb is displayed as a the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer the display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning it s red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune for example e i found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs these are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin rough handling will probably break it i notice that the clamp is easily removed so i m guessing planet waves may sell replacements the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it it is a ratchet rather than a clamp you press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around it s meant to be left on an instrument it s small enough that you can leave it on in the case if you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better and larger choices it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget i m going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars other reviewers commented on accuracy if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display this tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary i haven t had a problem except with guitars that have built in intonation problems like old nationals and they need tweaking even after a peterson strobe soapbox especially if you are a new player do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than i have time to list being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill people that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that if ever so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars i really love the fact that they are color coded so you don t mix your strings up and easy on my fingers i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install highly recommend i bought this strap for my taylor guitar it s a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft as it says it is made to fit well on taylor guitars but can fit in any other guitar as well the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted highly recommended works for me but it splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it they made it thinner so it doesn t stretch the strings too much as a consequence it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as arizona california is concerned suggestion to planet waves i think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings redesign the mount say with a velcro so that it s still hangs on the sound hall but it s attached to the strings it s possible to attach your product in a different way because i ve modified mine to my personal preference works without splitting the screen currently my favorite pick it s thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle i d recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like this is good for now keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking for the money it works recommend this product we all know it s just a container with a sponge in it no biggie i bought it to get super saver shipping on something else and because i plan to keep an all solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings but it should do the job put them on my daughter s guitar and she enjoys them anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing i ll take ernies over martins but not over d addarios on my guitars though i agree with the others reviews the sponge is too small and too thin but the humidify is small so it wouldn t fit any larger sponges okay for the price
72	very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks only thing i can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of it it does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them i was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me it seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor i ordered the product from dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players they have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually this product as advertised did not come with any picks if you order this and need picks make sure you order picks separately two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled but it seems it will cost me a fortune if i keep using these you should find another review from me but suffice it to say i just won t skimp on my cables when i spend s on amps and cabinets for good sound i was impressed by the quality of this product it is simple and does its job well easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or les paul or with a thin neck on most metal guitars holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise was a great value really satisfied with the chair i cannot explain how cool this chair is very glad i got it definitely worth the price for the great overall value that this chair really gives you this stuff will lube up your strings pretty well the only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use but it comes with a little cloth that i assume is meant for this little inconvenience the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case the case i got works incredibly well and always keeps the guitar well protected and my back comfortable while carrying it it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too i d recommend it to anyone edit i ve had good years with this bag and it has still yet to rip on me i have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners the snark sn is by far the best it is acurate and picks up the vibration of the low a and e strings without a problem this product does what it is designed to do very very well it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully i am in agreement with others that state this is a must have i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard this really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood i ve used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard i rub the entire neck down before and after i play it makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop which i suspect is what they must ve been using all these years and never told me though i never did ask foolish me since i ve recently gotten into doing my own setups where i ve read many forums and posters have recommended this and i figured what the heck it s less than the name says it all fast fret fast fingers i played over live shows from min sets to hr sets just this year on national stages my strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat grime and dirt flying through the air this stuff honestly works very well it is part of my regular arsenal i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac the simplicity of this mic is very nice the sound quality is also very decent i haven t ever used one of those professional quality ones but this has not disappointed me so far the only complaint i have is that there is no on off switch the only way to turn it off is to unplug it other than that i totally recommend this microphone i couldn t be happier with this pedal i have a les paul marshall class bb preamp ep booster analog chorus and carbon copy i used to get this annoying hum and feedback when i cranked the amp up even when i just plugged the guitar straight to the amp but those days are long gone now everything is nice and quiet i even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job i haven t noticed any difference in tone so far i was scared that the smart gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it s cheaper not to mention it has its own effects loop i don t understand how the noise supressor or the decimator could be better than this one i mean the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no this is my fifth time buying this stuff i really like the new container the tin is way nicer than the old plastic one this stuff works great and lasts forever i play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty dry to use one swipe is plenty strings at a time from nut to bridge then just fold the cloth and wipe clean makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed i have these straps on all my gear very well made will last a lifetime not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings hope that helps thank you this makes sliding on the bass real smooth it s also nice for cleaning it is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time and it s super easy to apply even though you re not a pro act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play this product is not what it seems it has a cool name but that s about it it s a tool oil that stinks i tried my best to get use to this product but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the st time after doing away with the fast fret my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty i now use old english and my guitars thank me my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me you will too these are great picks and yes they are slippery the reason is the material and method of manufacturing delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions these are probably the brightest sounding picks i have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them i use the mm for s on my solid body electrics mm for my s on semi and hollow bodies and mm on my bass guitar that s right i use a plectrum on my bass you can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like nylon i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh does it work yes and no first it did not appear that anything was coming out after a bit of rubbing i did notice a slight bit of solution turns out its mineral oil on the fretboard by the frets i tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless a paper towel would hold up better seriously i used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around but honestly it took me to mins and i noticed no difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar it says to use it before and after each session thats about mins of my time per guitar i general play guitars durning the course of a session i do still use this occasionally but i would not spend money to purchase it again just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner what s most impressive isn t the top drawer leather and craftsmanship that goes without saying from levy s it s the clever design the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap adjusts to almost any position and adjusts to almost any small wireless transmitter transmitter not receiver i used this on a string bass i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it her reason for her opinion is simple this stuff puts out a lot more oil or whatever it is than you would think this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard earned callouses soft which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast and did for my friend to apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string one string at a time i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string at first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard that s ok you will need to wipe away the excess and i m telling you if you accidentally get too much that excess oil may not come off easily didn t for me at least mine left little pools of oil between the frets and i only used one swipe and thought i had just a little on there naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling my friend hated that part too and i agree with her soft callouses no callouses this is a good product idea and i like it in theory and with my thick bass strings i didn t have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you it does what it says but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers these are the only straplocks i use and i have them for all of my guitars they are the only ones i trust they are solid secure and they look great and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security love em the tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when i ve been playing a lot the problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pull offs less fluid a few strokes of ghs makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience an alternative would be using vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard also i sometimes use an emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but i d rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong ghs allows me to minimize that
73	the best buy for your bass drum i don t know a lot about guitars and strings i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there this works and i really like evans but i got of these and they both looked different and looked cheap although i have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse i was looking for a thin crash on a budget and i gave this company a try and i couldnt be more happy i had reservations at first but when i installed it on my set and used it today i was very surprised it hasa great hissing crash that lingers a bit as a much more expensive cymbal would have this companyputs out a good cymbal and i have a combination of all of the top line names on my set in writing a simple review for such a simple product there s only a few concerns you should have would the adhesive dry out on this and does it wear over time the answer is it gets stars it doesn t dry out but i had to replace mine after years because it eventually wore out that s pretty good not perfect but pretty god so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack so much more efficient than a floor monitor i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips and because there is more than one channel i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics definitely recommend hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space very durable and they sound amazing i love these drum heads and would recommend them to anyone that needs drumheads it s a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it don t fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friends well constructed awesome price i think this patch looks cool on the bass i don t really hear any difference in sound but does give your drum head a better life span
74	come on now these are ernie ball strings what can i say that hasn t been said a time already there the best buy them that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost it is a great pleasure to jam on it around sound is like it s real big brother very very familiar i suppose it is the best choise for your kid all hardware is ok just give some days to tuners to get used to what can i say it s a cable it works very well on a pedalboard i personally use it to cable my pedal together from the first row to second row that requires a cable longer than or foot the foot is perfect and it works great this is a great stand in the past i have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made this one serves the bill i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable it is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased perfect size for us big guys i do recommend some snap locks for it though it s comfortable it s adjustable the color was a good match for the guitar unless you regularly gig for hours at a time why spend smackers on a strap when this one does just fine put the dough into the guitar not the strap by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time i installed these pins in my silvertone sd they fit great and are a lot better than the cheap plastic ones that were in it if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins the saddle will make a bigger difference in sound than the pins but every little bit helps for the cost you can t beat it i ve always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees all the way up to you chest the strap never fails i ve owned countless ernie ball straps and i always come back to them for the main reason i ve never had one fail a great strap for a great price these strings are great with my acoustics however lately i ve been using electric strings instead they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing i bought a cheap guitar that sounded really bad i replaced the stock strings with the d addario strings and it made it sound much better all i wanted was a simple tuner that s what this is if you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect pros works fast accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale cons built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped also tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room fyi snark makes more complex tuners which are actually cheaper on amazon that also have or extra features am totally pleased that i did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it works great get one i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners and what a difference i had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them the locking mechanism is great it acts like a vice in a woodshop project and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just don t go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times i bend the strings these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune these strings fit the bill perfectly for my desired sound from a yamaha lj acoustic guitar which has been doctored with bone saddle pins and nut when i decided to put the money into the guitar it was my belief that the elixir strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that i like so much in the lj and after all the work was completed that proved to be true to form i did move to the medium for a little improvement from the bass side and it s a most outstanding sound from a medium price hand crafted guitar elixir has the best most comfortable feel to me of all the strings that i ve tested and these provide the best for my liking sound on this guitar try them if it s quality sound that you re looking for these are great this is a fun pedal and it really seems to work pretty good as far a getting tube like tones simple this is an awesome amp there are so many settings on this amp you could spend hours with news sounds and effects so sick it s fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new sometime i want to get the pedal for this amp to preset effects i like great amp if you re just looking for something to either mess around on or practice with i play a lot of different songs on my electric guitars and this amp makes it really fun i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired at least it s long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length i am comparing it to guitar center straps which have double leather ends which are much sturdier than the ones on this ernie ball strap which are thin and single ply i wouldn t trust this strap without a strap lock if your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise interference i installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music no more hum noise crackling etc overall this was an excellent buy i like purple and it is purple the strap is sturdy it works what else needs to be said it arrived timely is decent quality and a nice color this makes the second one of this straps that i have ordered and i love them they are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself i don t have not one bad thing to say great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap i ve had this for days and i m so glad i bought it its basically a top end second delay with whistles and bells you wouldn t even think they would be on there i have had alot of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the second loop capabilities got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar this is a great strap for the money they leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast if you want to spend more money you can and get a little better leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones nicer but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double leather ends the color stands out well on the black background available in various colors for you get the best good sized heavy duty high quality amp with tons of sound construction solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff sound nice clear loud sound especially for an speaker and w amp you can definitely jam with a drummer no problem or just shred it wearing headphones effects there are amp models i e deluxe metal etc and with these amp sounds to choose from you can apply effects on top of any of the amp models the effects include chorus deep chorus flange tremelo vibration phaser step filter delay ms ms ms reverb large hall small room echo filter octaver etc so what are the presets each of the amp models has been pre programmed with three different presets meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds when you select a preset like the first metal for example the minute you touch the gain knob the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set same with treble bass volume and all other effects the moment you touch any dials or effects knobs you have custom control to tweak each preset just temporarily or save it if you wish it s so great because often i feel i would have made a present slightly more this or that simply grab the gain or change the treble or move from delay to reverb and make it your own very easy ease of use plug in your guitar spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects plug in ipod or computer with mm male cable it s that easy pc software i ve heard their is trouble installing mine said error and did not install on windows i know there are ways to fix this and i will do so when i have some time comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer works for mac or pc get more presets use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer play on guitar rig and amplitude awesome size perfect big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc looks like x to me the front metal looking grill is mesh but quality and looks great tuner super simple doesn t tell you which note is in tune just tells you left right or green in center for in tune all in all when compared to the line spider and many other fender amps this one has the quality sound the dozens of different effect combinations input for a footswitch aux for ipod and usb for computer it has it all i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it the reverb and gain distortion are so clean and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone my guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp don t sleep on this it s for a loud quality amp with s worth of effects peddles built in and did i mention easily customizable so easy i could teach a year old select a preset change the dials you want to change make changes permanent only by hitting save otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them love this amp and i ve shopped every comparable model this is the one hands down worth a minimum of louder than my friends w d one love fender mustang you rock nothing special just like every other strap of its kind i compared it to other poly straps i have and it s ok no better and no worse price was good it took a long time to come leather ends seem ok i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint i m using it as a spare so it should be ok i m a little disappointed i m used to a higher quality from eb products it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone i don t perform a lot of antics on stage it s just me and the axe i don t expect any problems hope this helps small thumbs up to amazon finally i found a long strap for my new guitar i had bought one earlier that was leather but was way too short it felt like my guitar hung around my neck this new strap is plenty long enough and looks good my only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most players will feel it on their neck but it sure fits nice and long i would recommend this to any guitar player i wanted this for overall practice however the only clear and good sound will be the satriani effect if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it can t still use it for practice and wont change it its just hard to get a clean sound out of it it s always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure stays in one place the only thing is i wish the flex was a little longer about three inches would be great but otherwise a wise and good purchase quality strap that fits tight secure on my signature dime and matches the dean from hell lightening graphics perfectly as you can tell by the title i ve got another of these little babies snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great these sticks are solid hickory which is insanely durable and sounds great for classic rock and punk rock drums these sticks are weight and sound matched so each pair will sound and feel almost identical so these are pretty great strings not much to say the price is really good about ten dollars a set which is really good this cable works fine i m going to buy a pair in january i used it live and they are really great durable and it feel s pro try one this is my second ernie ball strap i have gotten and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them these straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt if a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds and the length would be sufficient even if you are ft tall coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future
75	not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap it ll do limited dynamic range but it works wish i d have gotten something a little nicer though what can i say it does what it should pedals on a chain runs safely without crazy hiss and hum on my rig of course if you re running a chain of drive distortion pedals you re asking for it works great for me zero complaints this mic is great i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast unbeatable in price and quality you can t go wrong with a brand name like shure i have had mine for years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal as a veteran bluseman i recommend it it rocks as clean as a marsh possum these strings have a powerful tone for lead work however they re not on the bendy side which is great for rhythm work the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm if you need an overall great set of strings get these you won t regret it i like the durability of it and the on off switch it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder adapter its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used i haven t tried this through a pa live yet i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better shure later on
76	it tunes my ukuleles it tunes my guitar i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch hooray for this tuner these picks are perfect they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect i read many negative reviews on several sites i can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in g a and bb there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments this is what gives them their charm and voice i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do the set is quite nice for the price to describe my impressions of the th s versus my well used sennheiser hd s i chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values i like to use recordings i know well so i can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity andres segovia variations on a spanish folk tune narvaez from my favorite spanish encores in my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar i ve ever heard both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound the distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that segovia s arrangement of the original vihuela texture really emphasize for me there s a difference between bass presence and bass clarity i ll gladly trade less oomph in the gut for the kind of definition the tascam s bring out warm well defined with a crisp and clear treble edge the sennheisers while equally balanced were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top they were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board the th s just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow the george martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made the clean separation and space in the mix between guitar electric piano clavinet bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system the th s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the sennheisers and overall more presence it s a bit recording and this is the first time i can honestly say i hear the difference like being there in the control room seriously there s a greyness to the sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before but after hearing the tascam phones i doubt i ll ever be satisfied with less again stravinsky violin concerto anne sophie mutter from mutter modern the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity i can hear string attacks counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the th s that i simply don t hear with the sennheiser phones as far as craftsmanship the th s weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups the sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually the cup mounts are really well designed and allow fine grained way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head the cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort the cord is a hybrid the closest to the phones is flat diameter well insulated matte finish and flexible beyond that there s another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another feet i think it s a nice compromise that s probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to as we get older our hearing changes for most people it s a decrease in high frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum simply listening louder isn t always the best solution and it can be a tremendous ear opening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones i d encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these tascam th s are a good place to start some folk don t like these because sometimes they come off when knocked but i like them have few of them they don t squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool the danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with v to v by giving less power to them you can get some really spooky sounds great fun but can also help give you your characteristic sound i also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it like other adapters do the price is great i m planning to have several of this this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does holding my ipad i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice great product highly recommend
77	good inexpensive microphone cable even came with a couple of velcro straps the ends seem to be well made don t hear any anomalies in the audio i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home it does the job well if you re looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then it s perfect many adjustments to get just the right position it s definitely not a performance mic as it does feel a bit filmsy but you won t notice the flimsiness except for when you re adjusting it adjusting it is a tad tedious but you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes i ve mounted my samson q u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it it works well for sure then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension or it will tip over if there s too much weight just find something semi heavy and find a way to attached it to the existing counter weight and it will be excellent so this mic won t play nice with your large condensers pop filters shockmount at the start but just find a good counter weight and all will be well it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room it was a good investment and all in all you definitely get what you pay for if you re hesitant on attaching a lot of stuff to it then i would recommend shelling out a couple more dollars for a sturdier stand but atleast for me it does the job and does it well i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it i was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin naturally when the electric arrived i laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem i plugged it into my fender amp with a little reverb and wow is how i can describe what came out it sounded like i was in a great concert hall of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it now i haven t tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous cant say enough except the price was so low i couldn t have gone wrong too bad this item is well built and i like the terminal ends and how they have the spring built in these aren t going to be the most durable road cables but for home and light road use they will work well just got this stand today first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over the telescope mechanism is quite well made comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters i got mine set up to extend up to ft tall it s quite the perfect height for when i m seated on my stool one thing i did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved maybe adding something to keep it screwed in would recommend to others probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp seems well built and rugged although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end i initially purchased a pair ofmonster rock instrument cable feet angled to straight inch plugto use with my keyboards but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar i thought i d pinch a few pennies i am so glad i did i compared this cable model to the more expensive models i previously purchased and aside from looks could not detect any difference in sound i swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards ensuring that each model was used on each instrument still no difference what the more expensive model has going for it is looks i am not sure it the higher priced model is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling bottom line carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp if possible before making a purchase decision you may find as i did that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value even from the same manufacturer loved this mic when i hooked it up it sounds great and for the price you can t go wrong wish that it had a on off switch but you can get around that great for instruments and vocals as well was delivered on time as well amazon is the best and have the best vendor i got this for my wireless mics but they don t fit in this holder i got the wrong size holder other then that it is a good holder
78	the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners i have found i have both the the sn and sn for my guitar and mandolin respectively when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on if not sure which get the sn red one it generally will work for all instruments its much better than what i got with my violin its been good i can t really complain considering its basically tree sap it s ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected i would recommend going a little higher price it also arrived cracked the rosin does the trick and it s cased in a nice wooden holder so it shouldn t crack easily unlike those round rosin containers awesome cheap repalcement string i would recommend them to anyone who doesnt want to spend bucks on high quality strings you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do the great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so i don t have to have a seperate capo for each i also have a capo for guitar made by kyser and i can tell you that works just as well you can never go wrong with a kyser not only that i like the idea that it s an us company i ve had some cheaper capos and they just don t do the job they either don t press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much this kyser will last a long long time i ve been using one of these kyser s for a good while now i only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo if you never used one it s makes it much easier to change keys although i usually only use it when i m playing chords when i solo i like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on with a little practice you ll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz
79	good length but very slippery i had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn t slide around i took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that i have been commented on a few times now for the price why not be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric as far as the base product it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize i love this it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona california with the classic fender name scribed wonderful i have these on all three of my fenders again these should really come standard on all american strats it just randomly pops off my bass it s so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down i hate it i ve had this strap for at least a year now and it still works so well goes great with my guitar too i hope there had been a closer picture of the product i was a little surprised when i got it because it doesn t look as great as i imagined the white lightning is stamped on the black strap the same goes for the gibson name on the end of it maybe it will get better looking in the long run beautiful tone and durable string nice tension very good for bends sweep picking and rakes did i mentioned great value
80	i have of these combo packs and they are simply great i have pedals connected to these visual sound spot units on my pedaltrain pro and have all the wiring underneath looks pretty neat along with the george l s cables that are almost invisible the spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz connects and powers great no need for something fancy to effectively power up to of v pedals with one combo pack the adaptors work great with other than the regular ac connections like those found on mxr or boss pedals highly recommended i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats these look great and work perfectly i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc on my guitars this is a nice part looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar they are even and not warped like the stock ones were
81	like all gibson products this is high quality polish that one would use on a high quality guitar i have used gibson polishes for years i noticed an immediate improvement in my playing as this tuner above all others i have tried korg intellitune etc brings your instrument into dead on ringing true tune across the instrument i use this on my fender stratocaster gibson les paul custom fender telecaster fender stratacoustic and takaminie classical works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars with all of the features capo tune visual metronome acoustic as well as vibration tuning plus calibration this is one tuner you won t want to be without and the only one you need i had looked around for strap locks for my dean dime razorback and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them my guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation i installed them last night and could not be happier they are very solid and the lock is positive so you can feel the click when it is set i am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well this is a great product at a good price note if you are installing on a dean razorback or ml the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate body into the neck do not use this to mount or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw it is too long and will likely split your neck just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it it can touch it even and still function properly enjoy i really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and don t worry that i will hurt my favorite guitar ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings i tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the ghs boomers and d addario i have to say i only had a pack of slinky strings during my last setup and i m glad that s what i used because they play great and sound amazing
82	it s not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i m happy a little flimsier than the at but at the price it s good ok here s the deal i m just a small home studio type of guy and honestly i wasn t expecting much when i shelled out the for this mic i have just always seen it around and i thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi pattern mic the first time i recorded with it i had it on omni mode and played some acoustic it sounded amazing i can t believe this mic is that good crisp clean sound who cares if it s made in china like that one guy says and very flexible usage i ve since used it on toms acoustic a room mic for amps and even some background vocals and it has shined every time so if you re like me and looking for a low price ldc with multiple patterns get this you won t be disappointed at all i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised i tend to have sweaty hands and my guitar strings get a lot of crud on them and then eventually rust although i have learned now to wipe them down each time i play they still deteriorate pretty quickly and it s a pain when i wipe them down with a cloth they leave black streaks of crud on the cloth the elixirs are not as bright as other strings when you first put them on that is true however other strings lose their brightness after just a few hours of playing so i don t see this as a major disadvantage the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them when i wipe them down there s nothing on the cloth i ve even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully so for a player like me these are a godsend i don t detect any loss of tone they are a bit slippery and some people have reported having trouble because of this but it s fine for me definitely they re worth a try although they re twice as expensive as regular strings they ll last longer so they re worth checking out ernie ball makes titanium coated strings that i m interested in trying out and there are some other brands too so i bought this to replace the original string winder i had that doesn t have a clipper on the end and it turned out great the clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better thank you planet waves
83	quick and accurate i also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewine s books and it works great it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop the effect isn t as noticeable on darker finishes though it really helps on the back of the neck too makes it slippery and fast highly recommended this is very inexpensive and works great for my home wanna be purposes it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc but it definitely gives you the effect it links well with other pedals the battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a v plug in therefore i would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard v plug in on amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead i like it enough that i will probably get a few more of this company s petals as the effect is good and the price is right for my limited purposes this works great if you are a pro gigging or on the road you probably want to get a more versitile heavy duty and expensive delay petal years ago i used the clayton small teardrop picks i couldn t tell from the picture that these were full size and i didn t check the size in the description i still had a few of the small ones so i used them as templates to cut these down i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is it s my own fault for not looking at the specifications i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks but found dunlop r mm orange tortex small tear drop guitar picks pack which are a lot cheaper installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster cleaned it up buffed the finish out tweaked the truss rod a bit and installed this saddle with new dunlop s and this is one of my prize acoustic s now thanx graphtech
84	i ve had one of these for about years have gigged with it extensively and i ve only had to replace it once more on that later i m not really a cork sniffer re guitar tone i think most of our tone comes from our fingers and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me i think this monster cable sounds fine better well better than what i don t really notice a difference when i use different cables maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies but it s so slight as to be negligible i look for guitar cables that will last that s what i really care about and so far this monster cable does the trick i use other brands too this is my most expensive cable but i think it was worth the i spent all those years ago oh and the return process this was maybe years ago i called monster they gave me their address and i had to pay about to ship it back to them about weeks later i had a new cable i consider that to be excellent customer service seriously this is a great pedal i can t improve upon what others have said but i will mention a few points i use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone or to add more crunch to my fender frontman when inserted in the effects loop it s run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me i sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies if it gets noisy or self oscillates after a while change the battery to a fresh one better yet use an ac adapter i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews otherwise it s been on my setup for about seven years i take care of my stuff well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours i still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it s on it s great i ve been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can t seem to turn it off it s light small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for bucks it s a great deal this is a good eq for an excelent price not an excelent eq so i give it a out of and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals for your money i can t recommend the eq enough it s cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything i would say however i still want to say i love this tool not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt it s been useful to help me learn the letters of keys slowly i am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that i know where i am on the fretboard where i can go from there i use it by putting it on my music stand dialing in the key i want turn on the drum machine simply play the chords in that key to the beat then when i want to practice the relevant scales of the key i simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note it s that easy i will say that i do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned to really grasp it one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka moment from time to time more falls into place unlike some others i m not one to lug something this around in my gig bag who really is going to set study material like this prior to a gig that s what you do at home and it s called practice for a reason i give this out of stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory if not you may want to take some lessons then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons these aren t my first set i can t count the amount of monster cables i bought and own none has ever failed me so far highly recommend these nice features on a pedal this cheap i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal not the bulletproof construction of a boss pedal but i have quite a few behringer pedals and i ve yet to have a malfunction in more than a year i have an eh big muff and this pedal is closer to that than to a dunlop fuzz face for this price it s another great tool for your arsenal one thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass if you string a bunch of them together you are going to experience the dreaded tone suck if most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass you will be fine this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing even when running on battery power there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs for a cheap eq it does great sometimes though when i hit the switch the light turns on and there is a second before the signal comes back if it was not for that it would be a star rating i am not too worried about it because the pedal loop pedal is still cheaper then the mxr or boss eq s what can i say fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar you could probably find them at a cheap hardware store but i was too lazy to go looking i found the price on amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it the slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acoustic electric guitar and also sounds great with a cigar box guitar with piezo pickup the slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle ring and pinky finger i found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better imo i have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar but a dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchase jim dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and i think this one will last a long time had this for about years now it works great and for dollars it was a heck of a bargain the construction is ok it s plastic with a metal rubber bottom but seems sturdy battery is easy to get in and out and comes with one but is not shipped connected to the terminals signal wise if on it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static which raises the noise floor by a hair the noise isn t noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss works great in front for a clean or unclean boost but i tend to use it in the fx loop where it does what it s supposed to do i think it s a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup especially if the amp s eq isn t doing it for you or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal this thing fixes it all i would definitely choose this over more expensive eqs but i tend to take good care of my stuff this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm pretty decent price compared to gc as well
85	i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding i was wrong they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal i have a schecter hellraiser with emg x series pickups and they go great with them they are easier to bend too which is great i no longer use heavier strings like i use too these will be my mainstay nice overall with a good sustained ring from the steel strings and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones if it is super grundgy clean it with something stronger than follow up with this stuff leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time i am very pleased with the quality of this stand it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less it shipped on time and the packing was good who say s ernie ball can t make good acoustic strings this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon o what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings i ve been using slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for years and they have never let me down unlike some of the higher priced strings i might add very responsive and never dull or weak sounding crisp highs and smooth lows that don t get mudded out i would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and ernie ball super slinkys on your electric guitar still after all of these years and innovations in strings ernie ball still gets my vote hands down
86	this is my second fender polish cloth they are basic but that s all i need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after i m done playing the only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges even though this has happened to me it didn t keep me from buying the second one the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me it gets softer with time and use overall i have to say that i m satisfied with the fender polish cloth it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box the chord works great no noticeable buzz i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear i d have given this a star rating but because of the tweed fabric outer the chord is constantly fighting you with kinks i love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a yamaha i currently have acoustical yamaha guitars the fg s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar i usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and i can reach the full length of the neck with no problems it has a deep tone and good volume i give stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player very nice guitar slide the glass is nice slides very well on my electric and acoustic and it fits like a mitten not too much to say it s made out of foam made to slip between the strings made to hold two picks i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics my son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won t be dislodged still it does stay on majority of the time i do recommend this my son s guitar teacher calls this a fancy little pick holder and i ve had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time one must also be careful my son lost one of these so i know it is a possibility of it falling off he lost it after performing in a play on stage please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help
87	ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life my playing sucks sounds better with these strings bright and warm at the same time great tone easy on the fingers i installed these on a silvertone sd which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar they are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory if you are looking for a regular medium string these are real nice great product no matter the weight selections i ve found the ernie ball slinky series a worthy pairing for my acoustics theyy re responsive and twangy i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness no mud clear mids and highs with clashing mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now love it
88	it would be improper for me to claim that these fit stratocasters because i have a stratocaster remake and i drilled new holes for a stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in what i can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn t seem cheapo surprised it didn t come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag the size of the screws was right the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick and it came with more than enough to install a stratocaster pickguard i m sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways for some reason when i saw picks i think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks what i got was a slim resealable bag that s about th the size i was thinking of it comes with light medium and heavy picks even the light picks are thicker than the thin picks i had ordered before i like having the variety though this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness the only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so i could maybe hang it from my strap i needed a new strap but i didn t want to pay for one i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot i m glad i did the strap is awesome it s very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i ve ever had it totally deserves stars i love this little item i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it no more hunting for picks anymore when i am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it s always there when i pick up the guitar placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar i placed mine where i d never rub against it between the amp cord inlet and a control knob make sure it isn t in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it i love this and have one coming for my acoustic too only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar oh i use medium picks and fit easily into the holder and wouldn t try to squeeze another on in but that s why you have a gig bag anyway this is a must have item in my opinion for the price this is a wonderful strap it can get twisted and wear out but keep it straight and it will last you a long time it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable it also has that vintage fender coolness factor i have year old leather straps that will be around years after i m gone but i paid a lot for them and they re not as comfortable as this i ve even used these on gibson s oh the shame but of course they look best on fender s i guess the truth is they will work on anything the strap ends are great but they re not really secure gaskets can take care of that i own quite a few of these are they re great quality look cool in a vintage kinda way and feel soft on my shoulder these replaced the stock tuners on my squier deluxe stratocaster and were not a drop in fit there are two pegs on the tuners that didn t line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well if you thought a pick is a pick like i once did long ago you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and or complexity i use the dunlop tortex mm purples early on in my playing i was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better why after messing about i found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack the interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard with a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility i tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid s i like the dunlops feel grip and durability they hold up for a very long time how long i have had some last a few years they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability my students use them too i don t demand it but i do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges highly recommended you won t be disappointed always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm you just found it this is an exemplary capo no surprise as it s designed by ned steinberger who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics it s made of serious aluminum and the spring is super solid the tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it won t come off again until you loosen it no slippage here this also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it s even less in the way of your hand a very useful feature which most other one hand capos can t offer it s an easy on in seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets the rubber is well bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least unlike many cheap capos it sits well on any six string though is not flat enough for a classical but most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric unless you re albert collins who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here so this will cover all your basic capo needs it s got a little slot for the d addario brand tuner but i use a snark and these two go together well put on the capo activate the tuner on the headstock tune it up and away you go perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo if you ve ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo this is a godsend combo the capo also has a little pick slot which will comfortably take up to about a mm pick it fits picks perfectly by the way this ns artist capo is well worth bucks and since i got it my shubb and kysers have sat lonely in the corner if you haven t ever experimented with capos try them out they can really change the way you play your guitar and may help you find you sing better than you think as we all have our best keys and a capo can help you find yours i love playing bluegrass licks in g while capoed at the second fret for instance the extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it s almost like another instrument this goes for every fret pretty much up to about the sixth where it gets a little cramped all in all this is the best capo i ve ever used especially for this quality at this price probably the best capo i have ever had it s easy to put on and holds the strings well although you always need to check the tuning after putting any capo on a guitar this one seems not to upset the tuning too much i m impressed these work much better than standard stamped trees no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly i did notice in guitar center some of those spendy american strats have the cheap stamped out trees and non locking tuners
89	you can t beat these for the price i use them on of my guitars scale baritones in a and b and a standard scale in c i got a pack elsewhere for under bucks a set they sound really good no breakage problems etc not much to say about this one it s a genuine fender trem cover and it will do its job well these are high quality thick guitar picks the colors are great unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging i know the company is trying to save money but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive almost didn t know what it was because of this just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
90	honestly the strings are great they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings i love them and they will be what i buy the next time i change out as well highly recommended really am impressed with this gig bag my beloved jasmine fits perfectly inside has nice padding tons of pockets to store stuff backpack straps and handle for easy carrying and it looks fab love the price too can t go wrong with this one i was pretty happy with them when i got them and finally used them and will likely pick up more once i need them the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on i am a fan of the slinky guitar strings so i got these for my freetless schecter string bass like they were made for it this thing is awesome i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it it has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar and one that restsin the case up by the headstock i ve been playing for about years and have always used a humidifier this works just as good as anything else keeps my case at a nice humidity i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too just to make sure you have the proper humidity level update so being the lazy guy that i am i never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hard well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gel like feeling so i am convinced that they work now i ve used ghs medium bronze wound strings on my martin d for several years i thought i d give these ernie ball strings a shot after reading reviews they are lighter than i expected they are closer to light than medium i m not that impressed they sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets i think the next set i buy will be medium and probably ghs you never know until you try update i ve gotten used to the sound of these strings and i do like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing pure bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow bg sound though at my age i need all the help i can get so i ll have to admit that i like do like these strings this pick is great for strumming some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard if you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster every guitar player should own this tool instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool they did the job they re plastic they didn t cost much fit my string with no problems they aren t bone brass wood pearl don t expect them to be
91	realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar i have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well i have owned two of these stands the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared the second one must have walked off on its own while i was moving to a new place not the greatest stands by any means but for what they re worth i didn t mind spending another to get one sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable but price ability to collapse and it s light weight made it the one i bought again sounds disgusting very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows don t hope to take chords on it only on first strings may be try out fender s mini amp if you re searching for a little thing or but a bigger one total flimsy junk it leans wayyy too far back i ll be damned if i put my guitars on these things on the other hand chromacast makes one that s very close to this price and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid in summary do not buy this piece of junk you know when a good quality item arrives everything looks and works just as it is intended i love it for something but not a guitar wasn t sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook or notepad computer so i can follow a recipe it seems to work okay for that just don t use this for guitars an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far and the arms have no grip this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project it may even give you aids but probably not however animals could have been harmed in the making but most likely and in reality it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner what else is there to say they are easy to use they are easy to install and they are easy to check i ve tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to no expensive pads to buy just use water simple to drop down into the body of guitar no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole comes out as easy as it goes in i have of them love fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder one of two new models the other for acoustic guitars well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around ideal for gigs as well as studio and home solid performer michael haller captain soul s sound circus it does everything it s supposed to do i got these for about here on amazon the dunlop or schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that i can see they lock securely don t require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar s hardware i have both dunlop and hennessy straplocks and i don t see any reason to pay more for the dunlops i have two of these stands the electric guitar bass version and the acoustic version back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case yes folded up it will fit in my tweed fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar i do always keep it in the included stand bag to ensure i don t scratch or bump it against my guitar great at this price too buy several
92	i use this all the time it s pretty basic but really good for a beginner not all chords are in here but the core chords are worth the price i love these pick holders they re easy to get on and off they hold a nice amount of picks and you get that rock star feel throw picks at the audience a must for any gigging guitarist this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does it s job no scratches or anything on my taylor it falls over now and then but only when i run into it i like this bag though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured it s a bit too big for my tenor uke it s most probably made for a baritone uke all in all a good value for the money these are great strings and were my favorite until i found fender pure nickel strings some may like the sound of these some may like the pure nickel it is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too it stands as it should and it was a snap literally to set up it was like three steps or something wow i am very impressed considering the price this is very inexpensive and works great for my home wanna be purposes it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc but it definitely gives you the effect it links well with other pedals the battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a v plug in therefore i would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard v plug in on amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead i like it enough that i will probably get a few more of this company s petals as the effect is good and the price is right for my limited purposes this works great if you are a pro gigging or on the road you probably want to get a more versitile heavy duty and expensive delay petal this is a great music stand i like how it s adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in it s very sturdy and well built i don t ever worry that it ll tip over i love it i would recommend it just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome seems to stay in tune pretty well too for under you can t go wrong now i can use the clean channel on my amp with this pedal for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel for my other pedals and my electric guitar i have been using these for about years now i am very happy with these strap locks great product i knoew i did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room not did i want something that would tip over if i blew air on it my instructor of the guitar suggested i really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light weight yet sturdy to not fall over looked professional and could be the possibility of the one i would recommend and purchase again i really like the stability of the one i bought this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars i love its size and portability this little stand collapses and sets up so easy holds my guitar perfectly may buy one for my dad next fender s new mini acoustic guitar stand is one of two new stands the other is for electric guitars sturdy reliable and easy to take on gigs or use in the studio or at home michael haller captain soul s sound circus i m a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices i play guitar mandolin and ukelele and this inexpensive tuner is the best one i ve ever used by a long way i ve paid a lot more for a lot less it has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner i ve ever used it doesn t require a loud volume to hear the tone finally it doesn t seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone if i detune by about th of a turn on my tuning machine an difference i can t hear with my own ear this device detects it immediately all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning no more misplaced or lost picks this handy little device will fit perfectly in any out of the way spot on your instrument some say this capo work bad i have to ask are your guitar is good enough to use this capo or are you know how to use capo i m more than years of playing guitar this capo is worth the price good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts best recomended quality and price ps may not for very big guitar neck enjoy i have several different tunes but the snark is hands down the fastest and most sensitive has no trouble whatever picking up the low e string on my seagull acoustic which flummoxes my intelli having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier the only down side and this is a matter of taste is the garish color you shouldn t leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away which may be just as well
93	super usb mic i use this when i broadcast from streetjelly com i set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal just make sure you have all your mic levels set to not clip and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic i have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it boy was i surprised this case is awesome great quality fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great definetly reccomend this case many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use install hangars they are reliable so far they do not hurt anything on your instrument i am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars violin how self adjusting can they be apparntly quite these just sound great huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel
94	only used it a couple times so far but i like it i like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar as someone else mentioned it s hard to get the cloth back into the clear plastic bag inside the lid though but otherwise i think it s great i like how it smells does that make me strange in my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself i attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually i fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history i just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty just be sure to buy thekorg cm l clip on contact microphone for tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing just as the others have said its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass i also got my samick cr short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for short scale bassesbut im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and i would buy it again i play in small tight places sometimes people dance right in front of us i actually bought one of these for my partner because for some reason he would put his stand high and only use of his boom to hold his microphone the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently he wouldn t and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancers when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift he does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reason i bought one for myself as well and i do like it the plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though it comes apart quite easily my only complaint what i do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesn t slip down at all i personally love that because i have had boom arms that go limp and their is nothing more annoying i use these and the next heavier and have since they came out and the standard model before that great grip slow wearing and they don t break i ve been playing since and switched to dunlops way way back and have never found another i prefered so give them a try this is basically the leatherman multi tool for guitarist by leatherman i really mean planet waves the go to sure shot company that will provide solid guitar products and accessories i buy cables picks straps from planet waves so i guess you could say i m a fan of their company and by multi tool i really mean this pro winder string winder and cutter everything you need to know is in the title it helps to wind your guitar strings the grip is comfortable and durable and once you ve tuned your guitar you can clip off the excess guitar string awesome but wait there s more i should be on an infomercial there s also a nifty little pin puller for when you re string your acoustic instruments for the price this does everything and more i recommend if you need a winder just buy this you ll take out birds with one stone even if you only needed to take out one bird if that makes sense cheers i always keep these around during string changes i prefer the bass version to this if you can find it item is as described you receive felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick mine was purple picks were defect free but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks which a clean moist cloth will easily fix but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument none the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit but over time this starts to disappear the picks are pretty comfy to hold i ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams but alas i was wrong the winding apparatus works beautifully but the cutter doesn t allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference so i m back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post all in all a good product to have if you don t have pliers on hand or don t mind getting a closer snip i cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn t have pegs luckily the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge which i think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place each to their own i suppose the winder works well for me and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool so i don t have to search out a pair of snips but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward also the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy and doesn t work well for reluctant pins i actually like my dunlop winder better this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more but i guess that s the compromise of having a working cutter so i won t be throwing away my other winder any time soon although this light is a little pricey in my opinion it really gets the job done i do like the fact that you can use batteries or a cadapter to power the light the nine led s really light up my music stand the carrying case that comes with it is well made makestransportation keeping it stored easy r joyner i found this tool to be convenient and better made than i anticipated making it a solid value for the money no need for a collection of separate tools anymore this does a fine job of cutting even a thick e bass string very pleased also works to cut ukulele strings hooray hooray hooray i wasn t expecting much for the price but have to admit i m very pleased with the tone these strings produce straight out of the package after several hours of play and tunings they re spot on and sound sweet as cream butter great product and very highly recommend good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice its a nice pice easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar the only matter and its not a big deal is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect easy to see easy to use easy to get used to the display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound that is what makes it so useful you can t beat the price for such a great little tuner amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience i will be buying one for every guitar case i own i use these strings for my telecasters and i have to say the tone is wonderful beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks he says it s easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder highly recommend i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly i buy one of these for each guitar but i only use my favorite strap it s nothing special no frills just a simple concept that works it s important to maintain humidity in your instrument especially in a dry climate like west texas the evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument so when you first start using it you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist genius concept it works for me perfectly i no longer lose or misplace my picks easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in it ll depend on where you decide to place this pickholder i placed mine right above the jack plug i wind long scale bass strings onto my unusual super short scale scale six stringed bass instrument so i m betting i get more use out of this thing than about anybody this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster the cutter worked great too changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore can t ask for more than that i realy like the cutter the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way with just a simple screw it comes right off i much prefer it without the winder build quality is awesome sturdy and a bit weighty definitley worth a buy i have tried a few and this is the one i settled on if you need a multi tool the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good it winds it cuts you really can t go wrong here another really well made product from planet waves that will become an indespensable part of your guitar setup it d been about years since i ve had an electric guitar i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned i decided recently after moving back to my home town that i was going to get back into playing electric guitar only this time i wanted it to be more than a hobby i fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will easily deliver it came in perfect condition the action is set perfectly and i don t have any issues with buzzing strings it comes with clear black control knobs which i ll likely replace with something a bit prettier but overall this is a great guitar it even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp because well o it is a lp its no gibson but it is a lp very happy with this purchase these dava picks are very nice they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick the rubber grip area is great the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time the dunlop picks with the bumps are nice but this just feels a lot better between my fingers there are three little lines at the center of the pick the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex this is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there isn t much of an effect no matter where i place my fingers the effect is subtle at best the only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short the rubber can end up striking the string overall i like these picks a lot the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware i own an american strat too and plan on making the best of the chinese one going to upgrade electronics and everything else too these are exactly what s on my american strat stars after getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings i finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget i just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too i didn t expect the string cutter to be as well as it is i thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great it also has a pin puller which i haven t tried yet but i m sure it s great as well this would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician or if you just want a great all in one tool but this thing this is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out the wire cutters also work really well im glad i bought this product it is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor as long as the guitar is on it works great works a little better at winding strings than the bare bones winders the string cutter is very handy the pin puller as is usually the case is a little clumsy to use but it works i received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping it looks great the price is right but most of all it works wonderful very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case this is my new favorite tuner not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently it works like a champ i don t mean that it works i mean that it works better than any of my other tuners it is super tight it recognizes pitch differences that my ear can t leaving a better tune than my rp or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like i ve got laying around i plan on buying these for all my guitars i bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo it works good on all of them and is very accurate i also used it to tune my uncle s mandolin for him because he couldn t find his tuner other than that theres not much else to say p i haven t used the metronome so i can t comment on that snark tuners are great they are very accurate and are very inexpensive i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case i got this amp recently at a local store and so far im loving it i also aqcuired the mkii foot controller and is a perfect combination tons of sounds and it can be edited to fit your demands nice volume coming out of it also for watts it seems more recommended just what i needed the display is easy to read and easier to use my old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy a definate must for any guitar player its one great modeler i like the tweed that old tube sound and mic position on cabinets i am using this with bass gives you a really clean treble and distortion if you like also try it with bass you will like it rock on this winder makes changing strings a breeze and i like that there s an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string i also love the part on the end that pulls out the pins from the bridge so this item is three tools in one terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps i have a fender hod rod deluxe and though it s got the formel electronics mod still needed a nice touch this guy filled the need using the effects loop no need of volume or gain the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful works great right out of the box easy to use and accurate a must have for any guitar player turn it on clip it on and tune i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases you never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper cutter winder and pin puller gets the job done and it is inexpensive nice little kit it has grit sandpaper in it i hadn t noticed that in the listing maybe i overlooked it i had just bought some grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade the made it glassy smooth again wet sanding i used this instead of the that came with the package and it worked well for me i had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board big mistake it deadened the sound terrible i was miserable my guitar sounded like s after minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and bob s your uncle good as new i m going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars nice little kit i might even get around to using the grit paper that came with it one of these days works a charm on acoustic guitars haven t tried it on the electric guitars yet everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set nice strap i meant its just a basic strap so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far should last a while with good care i bought this set mainly because i wanted a cheap micro fiber cloth to polish off my guitars for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish the cloth is just what i wanted it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument i wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear the polish is just that it is works to bring out a shine but it is not a cleaner you also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string friendly i ve tried every gimmicky thing you can imagine and have always gone back to what simply works these dunlop tortex mm picks i ve tried different brands shapes and sizes and they all just get in the way these aren t slick like some of the others they stay in my hand and they wear ok as long as i don t get too wild and if i ever do drop one they show up super easy on the floor due to their bright yellow color i would be lost if they quit making these or changed them any hopefully they don t these are great great gig bag for acoustic guitar very well made with good padding it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps it fits the guitar nicely i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag the strap and picks were an added bonus a great value so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks i tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe but alas i was too slow it s a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a carlsberg bottle cap so the fender ones will do just fine plus they come in colors and say fender time to open another carlsberg cheers fender this is a pretty cool item i bought i thought it was cool and different is well worth the price and a good thing to have in your guitar case does what it is suppose to do what can you say about a tool if it works properly and it does what more can you say very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth big and wide enough to handle any guitar works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish i bought this mainly for the string cutter although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well at first i was skeptical because it s lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp i was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings i m happy to say that it does an excellent job much better than the pair of diagonal pliers i was using it cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly it s nice not having to carry the pliers around which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock as for the bridge pin puller i tried it once but it is rather ineffective i think it was included more as an afterthought as it s just a notched edge and can t really pull stuck pins for pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge i would recommend the dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive overall i give this stars for the winder and cutter i d recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case great sound quality meets full expectations cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality it s worth spending a few extra dollars on a good quality cable rather than to buy other crappy cables takes you hours to play around with all the sounds built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage nice and loud in a small package good quick change capo strong enough so far it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand it is very solid and will last a long time it s d addario you can t go wronggreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thanks it s oil what more do you want turn upside down squeeze hard use your man level strength and soon the tip will darken apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth it s okay to soak the wood as long as it s momentary don t saturate the fretboard and walk away wood absorbs oil too much oil absorbed fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling losing shape and flatness not a good situation lemon oil isn t like other oils it isn t very slippery and kind of makes things grabby it s oil but it actually works more like a solvent cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean like your frets hint hint just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re string and you ll be a happy camper the products work great applied them to my new les paul ukulele for protection the strings that came with my ukulele were junk so i decided to replace them with aquila strings prior to doing so i decided that i would like to prep the fret board the frets seemed a little rough and the rosewood looked a little dry to me so i ordered this kit to see what it would do it comes with both fret board cleaner and even a very fine grit emery cloth for the metal frets i thought i would try the emery cloth on the frets and was very pleased with the results the frets are now very smooth and shiny and the rosewood fret board looks like it is much happier after a little drink the polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster but remember a little goes a long way so the wax should last a very long time as i am sure the other products will too the cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument mine came soaked due to the bottle leaking upon arrival that is the reason i did not give this product a star it looked like the package was damaged prior to shipment since the out side package was pristine and the product was protected well inside with adequate padding i am now going to work on my gibson les paul custom guitar and i am sure that i will be very happy with the results great product which would deserve the full stars if it was packaged a little better when i bought this i didn t think it was going to be as good as it is it seemed a little plastic ie from the photos so i didn t think it was going to hold up very well it actually really surpassed my expectations however the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiple sized tuners it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem for dollars it s a really good deal bought it to replace strings for my taylor does all the job that i need it to perform winds the strings fastpulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wiredoes not scratch my guitar the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot can be fixed with some oil this chromatic clip on tuner is the best of the best one cannot go without having one for the price i ve tuned violins guitars and ukelele s with it this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without you can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments if you have it on the mic than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wish this little instrument tuner does everything for the cost you just cannot be without one one of my fav toys i use thin picks and so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i don t use i actually like the dunlop brand material so once i get used to thicker ones i ll try these the pack only have and thicker in case you re looking for very thin ones if so then don t buy this sample pack go and buy the dunlop nylon or cut the strings like they was made of paper really good price did what it was suppose no need to say anymore it is really the best pick holder i ever had i can put picks on it it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend it s a little harder to open than other capos i ve used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it it s not cheap and flimsy though i don t see this one wearing down anytime soon now stop reading this review and buy this capo you wont regret it this is a handy little tool the winder is nice and the clipper works well it doesn t pull the bridge pegs out so it doesn t get five stars from me and don t be too rough when winding or it will break not too hard not too soft my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using mm everyone has their own preference and i just didn t like the feel of those i bought this pack and they are awesome i lost like already but hey there s more i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar for a ten spot ya can t do better matte flat black finish is nice great durable foam contact points for cradling baby double dog dare ya to do better you just cannot excellent deal winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well does the job well enough i use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough i can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound this bench is great for the keyboards and when i just want to sit and play by bass guitar regarding it being too short you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height to sitting if it is too short then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price one does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesn t know which in or output is actually making the interference but once you ve established that it s all good baby awesome for accurate with tv on in the background this thing is just sweet i just love it easy no brainer only had it a few days but is working great and i like that it is true bypass price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on the default tuning display is perfect for me as i ve not been real impressed with some of the other top tuners out there imo you can t go wrong with this tuner very pleased i ve been playing for over years and now have three different electronic tuners so i m a good judge of the snark pros it s chromatic so it s good for every tuning job no need to plug it into your jack ambient noise doesn t affect it great sharp colorful display reacts quickly small enough to fit easily in my case cool blue color built in metronome powers down automatically to save the battery transposes up to four steps if you re using a capo will even identify major chords cons works better on acoustics and semi hollows than on solid bodied guitars made me realize that three of my strings need intonating or is that a pro metronome is visual only manual says that long term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars finishes big blue thing on your guitar looks weird now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners this is easier to use easier to carry around you don t have to unplug from your amp it works on acoustic or electric and it s chromatic and it s cheap definitely recommended a great deal on what i consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings yes and for good reason while it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety i have found that for my usa stratocaster that the ease of play with the strings is the clincher and they provide an amazingly full sound with no stress on the fingers at all overall i like this winder it s handy having the wire cutter built into it but when i am winding new strings it often slips off since i am using one hand to hold tension on the new string i would prefer this to hold on more securely so i don t have to put it back on several times but all in all it s a lot better than winding by hand and it seems sturdy it beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better it slips off if you go too fast but i thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this it didn t come with much of any instructions so i was using it wrong at first there is a big and a small slot the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use the cutter works great you just have to be careful the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better all and all it s one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master i hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesn t scratch the chrome off my turner pegs that and maybe they could use a long screw and some loctite to keep it from coming loose and well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find everything i have seems to be jet black so i bought this to replace the original string winder i had that doesn t have a clipper on the end and it turned out great the clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better thank you planet waves the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn t very friendly snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down it works fine but it s inconvenient the pick holder work as described i have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece it is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick it works well for standard guitar picks and will hold or picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument polyweb strings have a heavier coating so i prefer nanoweb for the ultra thin coat and brighter sound they re easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound because they re coated and have anti rust they last up to months longer than regular strings and don t make much finger sounds favorite strings i ve bought quite a few tuners over the years these are small responsive easy to read and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference these are great at first i was turned off by the toyish appearance but decided to try it after reading the reviews let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics and they perform way better than i expected as with any daddario or planet waves product it s always great quality and has great tone i ve used almost every brand of stings out there but i always come back to daddario i lose picks constantly years ago i resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when im not playing it that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks this thing is great i load it up with alternating hard and soft picks so i can easily swap out between songs best i ve ever spent these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well look cool to i will buy more when the time comes my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions this is the neatest little light i have ever seen it takes aaa batteries included but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out and has nice leds the lights are bright enough for my something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand battery life so far has been at least hours actually probably hours as my daughter has been using the light also i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable a real needed item is you play in darker rooms i maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since i no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy i like this string winder and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too but the bridge pin puller is too small and doesn t work on my instruments that s why i gave it stars instead of five as the title says weeks in and no issues at all it s comfortable and sturdy what else could you want in a guitar strap i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars i m surprised i haven t broken it yet the mounting process was simple recommendation buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don t already have one you don t want your instrument plummeting to the floor i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers they re holding up very well the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall whether that s a good thing is up to you i guess i don t have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped so maybe it is a good thing be careful when you hang it though it could definitely hit the wall if you don t place it on the hanger carefully alright for the past years i ve been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string and let me tell you doing this process on guitars sucks this tool is awesome it takes about minutes to change strings now and it s well made and durable the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine i ts not perfect but neither am i so stars would recommend to anyone a good piece of kit except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs it s also squeakily noisy when string winding the cutter works perfectly this winder and cutter winds and cuts fine but the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins oh well another lessson learned this metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it it is so durable filled with options very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician when i first saw this item i wondered why is the regular guitar version and the bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and i realized the bass version only has to tune four strings instead of six so it costs less because we don t need to use it as much but then i remembered there are string bass guitars and i thought okay shouldn t they have a one for string bass guitars sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when i realized with some dismay that there are even string bass guitars will this even work on a string bass after all that s more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool its function is three fold string winder string cutter peg pullerso no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably priced tool made by d addario the quality lives up to the brand it s solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed it does everything it s supposed to do does it well and is of good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons the winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use i would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening because of this design flaw stars instead of i note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys what i believe is that it is a mistake to sell the bass and standard guitar version on the same page from what i can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the bass guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity it s obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge the one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn t careful the same holds true for needle nose pliers bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they re doing don t get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using any modification tool i suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings to in seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didn t simply start a new listing when redesigning the device back in the s i used to have an ampeg guitar head with an effects loop i discovered the rack version of the bbe in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money the amp i have now is a totally bad ass fryette deliverance but sadly it has no effects loop so i thought i was out of luck as far as a bbe goes because as far as i knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop then i was looking for pedals on amazon and lo and behold there was a bbe sonic maximizer pedal i snatched it up with a quickness and i am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version one caveat if your signal is noisy the bbe can actually increase your signal noise for this reason i highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it this pedal is very subtle but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential it also works great for any instrument or sound system it s also great for vocals as well but you may want the rack version for those applications i would also buy the rack version if i had an effects loop to run it through imo the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the bbe does i d go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two bbe s for not much more money that you can use for another application these are great strings nice bright tone the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them get some
95	cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way it is very safe for guitar finishes i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great the arms are adjustable so the instrument won t rest on the pegs the foam is good and the hardware is included plus the price is great this is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely thick and durable made of awesome material buy it i got it to have it if i needed it i have found that i don t really need it that often and rarely use it if i was really good i can see the need but this is a keyboard not an organ i ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row on a pedaltrain board it s the perfect length and the very slight bit of excess can be zip tied against the pedaltrain leaving a total stealth install since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard granted i m no expert on what s out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials this is my first foray into that world but i ve used it and it s easy the polish is great the cloths are soft and just what they should be the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff everything here is as far as i can tell just as advertised a way to keep one s instruments in good shape i now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory and there doesn t seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar like perhaps some fly by night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there and knowing the way the world works i m sure there are some probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth or stars on the amazon review i don t know but come on this stuff is just fine after reading a bunch of reviews about this product i was not sure about buying it but i give it a try and i am completely satisfy it doesn t ad noise to my pedal chain i use it with a radioshack power supply v a and a can tell that not a sound came from electric issues i m not saying that it is better than a voodoo lab power brick but for me work perfect and i don t see why not taking it out for gigs my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning i am pleased with this product monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time you cant go wrong with monster cables nice quality and love the cutter the winder is a little awkward to use i guess i need a little practice but the cutters are great i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick seen these and they work great when needed looks good too makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body everything conditioned and polished great quality product highly recommend this should be your first pedal for bucks you get every effect except distortion no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck it s clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife i just got my snark tuner and i m very impressed with it it attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar the digital readout is easy to see and it gets me in perfect tune quickly it is far superior to previous tuners i ve used i m used to the old s and s speakers that i ve had on my stereo since that time i read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before i was blown away they are all correct get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing i listen all the time with different headphones not the same the way the music was separated so well i swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out i don t know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when i use them to watch movies listen to music etc they have lots of punch even when i play my guitar through them pod hd pro these just happen to be my favorite i always keep mm mm and mm sizes on hand mostly use the s i ve been using them for years and so will probably never change i like the grippiness of them i hate smooth picks picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like these were the strings i started on a year ago and have tried a few different brands in this time frame they hold up imo as well or better than most brands i ve tried especially for the price i probably change my strings more than necessary so i have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality these fit that requirement well
96	the dunlop guitar fingerboard kit arrived very quickly and was put to the test immediately i am pleased with the product it makes my guitar look new again i will definitly look into their other products thanks to amazon for the quick service i just put this on my dot hollowbody it s a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job i like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it the price was great had the gibson name on it and was a great value stars this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie it hears things i don t and tells me whether they are what i want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together if you like being in tune this is probably for you it is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything you can clamp it on a cat s tail but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don t even think about doing that you sicko great design easy to read works better than other brand tuners i own only bummer is you can t carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one if it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about dollars oh well i suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool hip out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity oh the peer pressure this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar my fretboard hasn t been cleaned oiled in years so it was extremely dry the cleaner removed visible grime the polish cloth shined up the frets but most importantly the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel i am very pleased with the product really a nice mic i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs makes my voice sound fantastic i read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mine worth a shot if you re on a budget like me i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape i guess this kit works okay but it s hard to use it will probably last my entire lifetime i think a smaller kit would have been better you really need to remove the strings when you use it so you have to take off all the strings i usually only replace one string at a time when i am changing strings so i had to change my habits if you have a guitar without a truss rod that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you re done changing the strings since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned i m no expert but i have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent however since i love my guitar i use it anyway i tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both i didn t think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp it appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner i would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet i don t know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner update the more i use this tuner the more i like it it is easy to read and use and doesn t appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was of course i am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition works well seems to hold up well also treatment lasts for awhile emery cloth for polishing frets is nice worth for sure
97	when i tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent noting that this product comes from china the first thing i suspected was cold solder joints i warmed up the soldering iron and opened er up and yes not only were there cold solder joints but there was a small piece of loose wire shorting components at random typical of quality control in the people s republic of china a little touch up with the soldering iron and it s back to normal whatever that is i m a bit disappointed with the octave but i m keeping it because it s a good fuzz and i voided the warranty the normal mid cut switch is part of why it s a great fuzz i think i ll replace the fuzz control with a pot that provides a wider range before going into supersaturation but the rest of the controls i ll leave alone dislikes quality of chinese products is a crap shoot likes it s a good affordable effect pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price i d order again if i needed another one they work great you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings i use these on an old gibson semi hollow body nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all it comes with one free disintegrating pick it is really awesome all you have to do is alt pick in th and watch it dissapear before your very eyes lol great product though i have used ernie ball strings for along time mostly slinky s or super slinky s i read the review on these and thought i would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a lp i bought these to replace the stockers on the epi lp i just bought luckily i order two packs i was putting on the top e string and had turned the crank less than a few times not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet and pop it broke i had ordered two sets so i put on the one from the new set no problems until i got to the g string then pop another breaker very sad quality after finally getting them on and in tune you will need to stretch the top strings alot to get them to stay in tune especially the e i have to say they have a great sound to them nice tone and sustain great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too these are thick strings but still bendable just not very far i would rate the sound stars unfortunately it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are so i have to give these three stars overall i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty the sound is unbelievable thick and creamy sound lasts slmost weeks before the tone dies good price good strings great highs and lows but rough on the fingertips and difficult doing barre chords slides and single string progressions ok with more effort so perhaps i don t know what shade burgandy really is or the picture is a bit misleading it is as stated although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven as too dee s reveiw the buckle doesn t seem to bother me i am not calling him or her out or anything my best guess it s playing style i myself play bass when i first started i played on the inch straps and found they bothered me went to the straps proplem solved i am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother but for me and the way i play no complaints give these picks three days and you llnever go back to another style almost impossible to slip out of your fingers great tone amazing clarity effortless harmonics durable and fast this pick literally makes you play better
98	i have finally discovered that the perfect set is a moving target as arthritis creeps in i find myself playing heavier strings with a lower action and these work in that respect another advantage of usiung this set is that it beefs up the treble side without making the bass side too boomey telecaster anyone i hate winding strings i got this to help with that it does it job very well you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time it could be a little tougher but as long you don t give it hell it will be fine great and cheap product i use earnie ball strings as my backup strings they don t have as nice and clear a tone as my d addario or curt mangan strings nor do they have the life expectancy however they are cheaper and really easy to bend since i can t afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time i go with these when i m practicing they do break alot when i play some crazy solos which blows and is the main reason why i m not giving them s no it s not my technique i ve never broken a string on any other brand strings i ve tried when i m in the studio recording i prefer like i said before d addario or curt mangan strings however to save money i practice with these strings and i think it s not a bad method as i go through strings like doritos i eat doritos alot i read a review saying that there bridge was floating out the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping i had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long so i did get to play em but all my strings except the a e popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar which it came with btw the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn have to use pliers sometimes but the strings sound great if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w medium gauge elixirs i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks they are so grippy i haven t broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so it s hard to loose them but i still do if you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while you re playing they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the mm picks for that
99	great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone i m not saying the tone is bad but it s not as good as quality strings with no coat that having been said i m pleased with them as a string for guitar practice they last for months without a change in tone i don t play much in public venues so it is not a problem for me to change strings when i do use this alot on all kinds of electronics it gets crackling knobs going again i ve use it for years recommend
100	the d addario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price these are excellent strings the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar they are inexpensive and sound great for somebody that is a casual home musician coated strings might be a better choice the difference somebody that plays a two or three hours every day will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money it seems like yes they are the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better there isn t a huge difference the direct comparison string is d addario exl d addario exl nickel wound electric guitar strings regular light at roughly a set these are good solid strings at a bargain price the exl bt strings are about a set if i were going through a set of strings every few days the exl s would probably be a better idea but if a set is going to last a week or two the savings overall is pretty small i would use the exl bt s my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot the new d addario coated strings are fine but they end up being about the same price as elixir i ll stick with what i know well my lucille did love these strings they worked out just fine on the packaging i don t like what d addario has done all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes they loop two strings together and i hate that when i m stringing my guitar i like to work with one string at a time and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing but seriously that little paper wouldn t kill anybody i also don t care for the color coded rings on the strings lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors it is a small thing but i don t like it i prefer that the rings all be brass one color yeah i m the only one that sees that problem if i work one string at a time from an individual envelope the color coding is not necessary these are fine strings they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my son s acoustic guitar he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings he says they last a lot longer and sound better too i ve been playing guitar for over twenty years now and i ve tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these elixir coated strings i ve come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it eventually all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn t make any sense if you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what i do is i get the least expensive ones and make sure i wipe down and clean them even using products like string cleaners and fast fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the u s and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names granted elixir probably isn t one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price i myself use generic kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and memphis electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest i could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way in fact you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings at least most people would be able to hear the difference don t get me wrong these elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique practice getting better cables pickups amps guitars etc than from just using these strings for better string life just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use this discipline once a habit is good enough peace i heard about these from a friend several years back i teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services these strings allow me to keep on keepin on for several weeks at a time even with constant usage i wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions there s no such thing as a best string from experimenting over the years i ve found that while i have old standbys that will be the first thing i try often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years they re expensive but they last a lot longer especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly also they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings elixir polywebs were the first coated string the coating is much heavier than that of other strings this produces a much less bright more muted sound i have an old koa guitar that is so bright i can t stand it with standard strings the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where it s perfect if you re looking for a darker sound then elixir polywebs are definitely worth a shot if you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings then you definitely don t want polywebs the stars applies if you want this particular type of sound if you don t want this sound you could end up awarding them star very nice super vivid easy to see color the clamp portion seems to be sturdy and well built this is a great buy for the money i ve used these picks for years with great results if you ve never used this stile picks you won t be sorry
101	this installed easily a nice feature is ability to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument when the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain i might have had with earlier straps a keeper for sure i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night i typically practice sitting down without a strap when i am alone but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band i had previously used a very expensive padded leather cradle type strap which i really liked i sold that banjo and the strap with it but recently re acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap but was not willing to pay the again for a premium padded leather strap i saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance i am glad i did this strap may not be as elegant as fine leather but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction what blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo which weighs about pounds literally felt half as heavy it is no joke at first the feeling was unnerving because the strap has some elastic give to it you get this dual sensation of a the banjo feeling super light and b as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor paradoxical i know but that s where the magic of this strap is it is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you but in reality it remains very stable when playing like i said the build quality is outstanding my only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non traditional so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument like a string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap this is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point i think i might try these on my electrics though i already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps i ve been using national medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke decided to try the dunlop overall i m very pleased with this pick previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums this is true but isn t a complete description basically the national picks are much more elongated so while the nail to thumb pad distance is about the same on both the across nail distance is much greater on the national picks i actually find the dunlop pick to fit much better and i don t get extra overhang as with the national which tends to catch the string i have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man the neotech is by far superior to anything else i have hooked up to my gibson ess the straps are easy to hook and unhook i have two sets on my banjo one set for the neo and another for the harness i use when the back needs a rest it s easy to uphook one and hook the other well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts i play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun that s all i can say it makes me creative and i have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this it s just fun this tuner is easy to use i have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn t seem to be perfect on pitch this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase my mother plays the guitar i am a banjo mandolin player and the snark sn came in the mail while i was gone for days she opened it up got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn t been in tune since i dunno and she loved it lulz this little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup i was using my old korg chromatic for those times i wanted to see if i was singing the correct note and was actually pleasantly surprised that the snark sn had a mic one less accessory in the little bag now di am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function however its neat as you can play without the tick tock distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo mmm i would still highly recommend using an audible metronome side note if you have friends family that play a string instrument be aware your snark sn will be making the rounds
102	it s a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost the fact that it looks like it s made out of bat armor is a huge plus for a clip on you can t beat the accuracy this little unit gives you i love abalone these picks look really pretty like seashells and they last pretty well the thin picks are pretty thin which make them nice for acoustic strumming and whatnot but i would recommend mediums at least for the electric guitar
103	i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar and will soon replace them on quality control the high e steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it two of which show after stringing the guitar string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad on sound these seemed okay at first but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week especially the high b and e steel strings which just don t sound that good to me and i find the low e wound string notes tend to be too high as i move up the neck more so than other sets i have used guess i ll go back to d addario and ernie ball these are good picks and produce a great tone they re better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers i really like the strings they sound very bright and go well with my guitar i do hope they last quite a while i put them on a bout a month ago but that guitar is only lightly played so i will try to update when i change them i am primarily an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago a gibson les paul what i am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars most name brand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others a few are actually a notch above the others these nyxls from d addario are definitely in that notch above category i find them easier to play better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others i have tried i plan to stick with them a few comments about each area playability these nyxls bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting left hand than do most of the others of course i have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time most electric guitarists who i know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly i prefer a blend of both just as i do for my acoustic instruments these nyxls provide the closest blend that i have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics andtuning tuning and re tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction even some really good sounding strings don t hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used less time tuning more good time playing all in all i found no flaw in these strings there is always something new coming along and d addario s formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now i used to use fender medium picks only now for jazz and metal i use this pick you will just have to try it for yourself to see if it is right for you snark tuners are great since i ve bought snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way i ve had some for years that i still use today without ever changing batteries or anything they are great and last forever this one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine tune your instrument it have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played really nice piece of equipment for a small price these elixir nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings great product these extra light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead i buy elixir nanoweb strings in singles so i can select the gauges that i like even better a great product no matter what gauge string you choose these do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings i like them works well even with a room full of noise plus it s easy to see these are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a guitar or uke very accurate when i wanted a g i got a g i have such a refined ear that i only have this around if i have a head cold or you know don t want to show off but it s a good tuner my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar his old one lasted about years worth the cost i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars good brand and good tone stars for this one i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar these work great and look sweet too their shape keeps your guitar securely in place but is also easy to unhook when your ready high quality product and very easy to install just what i wanted to have when used outside where there is a lot of wind noise i sometimes play in a park or outside around the bbq a must have i bought this power supply for in home use i don t do too much gigging or recording so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around the product works very well i m able to power of my pedals easily the cords are plenty long in length however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other i e having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal however that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product i haven t had to use any of the special adapters though but i plan on getting a line dl so having the line adapter is a great added touch best of all all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home i ve been using this product for months now and have no complaints you can t beat the price these strings are my second choice after the elixir bronze they are warmer sounding well balanced cost a lot but well worth it to me i m a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves what does this add to the others well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo in other words it s freakin perfect so i d give it stars except it gets because that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius full marks you can t miss with this product great tuners ive had the snark s i think the blue ones and they were really good the rubber part always fell off it is too early to tell if this will last longer but so far so good these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful my only concern is that if the strings aren t wound properly they seem brittle and break e g low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking they costed twice as much as my usual d addarios but after weeks of use i couldn t be any happier i ve heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why they are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright clean and crisp they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier a great buy overall regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing so when i was earnestly considering ordering this string i read the summary in which it was stated elixir strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your dna and other contaminants ohhhh protects my string from dna yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right in fact it s the worst contaminant ever worse even than the oils and acids on our skin worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the dna from exposure because the dna is the blueprint of those cells contained deep within protective walls but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings honestly it s like none of us have ever attended a biology class because we re musicians as i read the reviews i noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo i noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from amazon hmmmm the first honest review i found was one which said these strings sound somewhat artificial ah finally one of the real reviews look the product may be good or not it may be the best string ever or not but am i going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently can t stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype we re musicians not morons if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life no matter how heavy the marketing hype if the string is bad you ll only sell one set if it s good you don t need the hype edit follow up after reading numerous reviews this does actually seem to be a good set of strings which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldn t need spin to sell just sayin
104	i was using a nylon strap before i got this one i love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap the leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and i don t have that worry of it coming loose time will tell if they last longer than strings rd the price visually they don t appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings i was expecting something different but as far as sound goes the strings tuned well and only required some stretching times to get them to stay in tune even after playing smear notes on several songs my problem with cheaper strings de angelo was they would tarnish or rust quickly the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar the company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last to times longer i ll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not since these are literally triple the cost i ll know if it was worth the extra expense hopefully these are made in the usa instead of china like most other things we buy in america good or bad once i see the longevity of this set i ll add to this review at that time the nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but on the negative side i replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings i ve been playing guitar for about years and within the last year bought my first taylor guitar taylor guitars ce ltd grand auditorium acoustic electric guitar it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory i am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce what s even better is how long they last i m pretty hard on my strings i usedunlop standard tortex picks pack purple mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly the nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several months instead of weeks they re a little bit more expensive then other major string brands but after about a year of listening to these only gone through sets so far they re worth the extra few bucks they feel great last longer than any other string i ever used and most importantly they sound terrific the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges my taylor is much louder now that i use these however you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light these are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer when they start sounding a little dull it wipe them down with fast fret loosen off the tension a bit and wipe em down firmly and they sound new again these picks work well and look as pictured the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture i would recommend them i have lots of friends who play these strings some love them more than any other string and some are like me they re clearly good strings and i love the way they play and feel on my fingertips but i can t get past the sound it could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars but in any case i m not happy with the sound and that s why i have a hard time giving them a solid five star rating i tried these on two separate guitars i play regularly and wasn t terribly impressed with the sound on either one is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone and is crisp clear and fairly loud these strings softened the tone which i wasn t looking to do they sound okay but nowhere near as good as the martin sps i use to really bring out the best in that guitar i also have a cutaway electric acoustic i use to sing with because it s fairly quiet and the softer tones don t drown out my voice these strings made the guitar even more quiet and there was a considerable drop off in tone quality as well they might have been cheap old strings because i couldn t tell that there was anything special about them this particular guitar didn t have spectacular sound to begin with and these strings did nothing to improve it i like strings to either sound as good as other strings or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar these strings did neither for me however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp based upon my experimentation i would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and you re not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality you ll love the way these strings feel and play i rate them excellent in that category but for me tone is of the equation i d play wire wrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings in the tonal category these strings fell short on a guitar with excellent tone i noticed a distinct drop in tone quality and on another softer more muted guitar tone quality vanished in the final analysis if you re a picker and your guitar can be plugged in you ll love these strings if you re really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesn t have stellar tone to begin with you might gain some playability but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock they look fine when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly delivered on time as promised compared these all in medium s on a taylor dreadnought martin sp bronze phosphor bronze martins lifespan sp dr d addario ej phosphor bronze and elixir nanoweb bronze and phospher bronze i tried them back to back switching back and forth narrowing it down to d addario and elixirs i did the same with these sets one day i d try all playing along with a cd then i d try a different set every days the elixir comes out on top best sounding of all smooth on my fingers second elixir phospher bronze last was d addario i d be satisfied with the d addario they do sound good but the elixir sounds feels better i ve used these for years acoustic and electric very hard to beat i like the feel and texture of these pics they do the job brilliantly i bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone i was looking for on my week old guitar installed as usual and tuned them they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible my capo could not even hold them i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now use at your own risk i personally wouldn t give a nickel for them
105	these strings sound amazing they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing i get better harmonics with these strings as well these do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings i like them sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings these are my favorite strings for electric guitar i ve been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago i ve tried other strings like gibson and d addario but i like the sound and feel of ernie balls the best they feel nice full thick hefty i play blues jazz and bluesy rock i use these on a gibson les paul vintage mahogany and a yamaha neck thru body electric and they are good for the music i play and for providing a full bodied sound there are a whole host of big name guitarists who use these strings and for good reason i buy them in packs to save money can t seem to find that option here on amazon the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works i dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments but it does the job it was made for the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged if you like this guage you d like these i just tried them just to try but i ve confirmed i like heavier gauges
106	put these on my prs se and i love em i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe they were a perfect fit no problems whatsoever the last thing i would think to upgrade to improve the quality of my music is the cable i did not know that these cables actually made a difference my guitar sounds cleaner when i use this cable versus another generic cable that i ve had for a while it was a pleasant surprise i also heard about the wonderful warranty that monster has the cable has so many good things going for it i now know what to buy the next time i need one i get everything on amazon now need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment he makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings i do not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time stretch them bend them and they don t break if your bending a couple steps or more then i would love to know what string holds up consistently thanks much what makes a good cable one that works i ve had these xlr cables fail because the pins get loose so i hope this doesn t happen to this one no on off switch is a bummer but it works solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience update after playing in a small shed for a while the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a b note we messed with the pa and all the electronics what it came down to was my mic pyle pro pdmic professional moving coil dynamic handheld microphone placement i switched mics and kept them in the exact same position and the rattle went away whats all this mean the quality of this mic is just ok if you ve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one they will always sound the same as the very first day i love this strings currently on all my guitars i used to use the tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these i ended up using that pick for something like years playing times wk once i started playing hrs wk at my church i decided that this pick had proven its self so i order a small box i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one fyi i generally don t play hard and i always play acoustic nanoweb custom lights i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic which i was pretty happy with for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn t have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems and i was right i put a pair of d addario xl highly recommended for those players who can t decide between s or s and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently don t let the higher price on these strings entice you go with a good set of d addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long lasting strings i really like these strings because i have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast i can play a guitar once and leave it there for weeks and the strings will be rusty and nasty when i return to it i now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them but this stil happens then i happened across these elixir nanowebs they are great i no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly and they stay rust and gunk free for weeks of regular playing however i did encounter one strange thing while playing at a rehearsal my e string just popped and broke hurting my finger a bit i was surprised because outwardly the string didn t look that bad so that is the downside with regular strings you can tell the string is near the end of its life b c it looks really bad with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking made me a little cautious i still prefer these over other strings though these are the best strings ever i ve tried almost every string on the market and these are by far my favorite they sound great and last forever believe the hype they really do last far longer than any other strings and they sound great while doing it many other strings will sound great for a short while but as soon as they get gunked up they lose any brilliance and tone and become dead sounding not these they will sound great for the life of the string in fact the only way i know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good which they don t but because i ll start having intonation problems and i know the strings need to be changed normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long i ve tried the polyweb strings from elixir as well but i didn t like those at all to me they didn t feel right sticky or something not like your fingers stick to the strings but like you could tell they were coated with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever the only string i ll use pricey as far as strings go a lot of people swear by them but i get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less
107	it s a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost the fact that it looks like it s made out of bat armor is a huge plus for a clip on you can t beat the accuracy this little unit gives you good strings for my electric guitar i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more nice basic guitar strap great price and should last long enough i have started using the padded levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap this can be a little scratchy been using these for years they feel great last longer than any other string and most importantly they sound great they cost a little more than other strings but they re worth it totally awesome strings i ve heard other strings are great too but i highly recommend everyone try these if you haven t outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time elixirs for life i d pay double for these strings all day i ve only had these strap locks for a couple weeks however they ve performed well so far the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these i would recommend these strap locks over any others currently on the market but i m working on designing a better lock this pedal is very nice it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great you can just plug it into your keyboard and play it works very well after all these reviews i expected the greatest strings ever golden strands of glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection instead i got a decent set of s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup i use a prs with a wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings and i pre stretch them gently but completely plus i tune down to eb for vocal and breakage reasons so i break very few of my normal strings slinky s ergo a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension tuned down is unacceptable especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings as for the tone it s definitely bright and almost too edgy but nicely zingy all told yet one negative i ve noticed after about hours loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings making them harder to tune sounds odd i know but when i replaced the d with a slinky d replacing singles ain t cheap either at triple the price please note i ve since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the elixir strings so i must say i m summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings what s the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast especially when it costs three times more and what s up with the tuning thing and why do these cost so much more anyhow is a micro thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string not when that string is toast in minutes zero doubt there anyhow i ve got five elixirs and one slinky on my main ax now so as they age i ll get a good feel for how the elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone and i ll report back here in a while and by the way that slinky d sounds almost exactly the same as the elixirs tonally so much for magic elixir tone don t get me wrong i really do want to love these as i hate changing strings but geez guys how about some quality control if i m going to pay triple the price then is it crazy to expect triple the quality or heck even just a little better ps if you look at the d addario reviews i love their acoustic strings they respond to many of the reviews and questions i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions edit and now after only six hours of playing on that guitar the b string popped at the same place as the d neck pickup once again i ask what good are strings that sound good three times longer if they break three times faster edit come on after four more hours the a string went i only play that ax one or two sessions a week and the next time i joked to the drummer which one will go today he said he s amazed the g is still on as he plays too and knows the g takes the most tension an hour later guess what yep so that s four broken strings in less than hours play seriously not only are these not a good deal for bucks i d be bummed if they cost bucks the only plus i can think of at this point is they sounded good when new but dang unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such i d stick with slinkies or d addarios unless i got a bad set which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money edit i called elixir and told them about the multiple breakage and they sent me another set that set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet thought the tuning issue remains i ll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all these are my favorite brand of strings when i was a beginner a few years back these were the st strings i bought on my electric since i used them on my acoustic and i have to say elixir is my favorite brand of strings they last long are easy to tune have a nice bright sound if you take proper care of them wipe them down when your done playing keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it etc that bright sound can last about months or more i usually just buy about two sets a year im a heavy player i play about hours everyday i love the coating aswell but the medium gauge up usually don t have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings but overall these strings are awesome are a must buy for every guitarist good spring action made pretty solid no buzzing on the strings when i put it on the lifetime warranty is what i am stoked about i will probably buy two more for my other guitars highly recommend it
108	great deal for the price works fine but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric did the job for what i needed now i know i would love a better one like a fishman i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great i used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft lint free rag and it would act like a polish the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light great product the apogee jam works great and it sounds great the operation is very simple you plug in your guitar and plug in to your mac or ios device i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band if there is any latency i can t hear it it works beautifully apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception i was able to plug in a microphone line level into this as well and record my vocals likewise it worked well with my string bass as well i was able to record a whole song in no time for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable these are excellent guitar picks they don t slip in my fingers like the eddie van halen guitar picks i purchased a while back although this is hardly a high end microphone it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument although the output signal seems like it could be stronger the stand is sturdy too so this is probably not the best choice for the full time professional musician but for busking around or playing in clubs it s worth a look i have written other reviews about elixir high quality strings great for acoustic and electric no complaints on these strings just what i needed for my home studio monitors that sit on the table next to my computer and my daw system was surprised at how many different versions i was sent they all work well thanks heaps elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic they last forever and don t rust they sound awesome get them
109	this is not a top tier condenser mic but it is well worth the dollar price tag it has different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch the carrying case is also nice do not expect this to be mxl or even behringer b quality but it s still better than no condenser and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic ing i ve had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap durable and reasonably accurate i own several different tuners and what i like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it at ten dollars i think it s a no brainer it s the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment they are well made reliable and cost effective the xlr connectors are secure and i couldn t purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light item arrived on time and as described my son loves this polish cleaner he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny they glisten when he uses this to polish them great product elixir strings are the best i have ever used they sound great and last far longer tonally than anything else i have tried my husband got these and they don t get dirty as quickly which is a plus initially the sounds aren t as clear as the uncoated ones but it wears off after a couple of hours of play and you wouldn t know the difference he ll buy them again no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind this amp is awesome its great just like it s advertised i play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the fender fuse software fender fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire the amp itself has presets as advertised are shown in different colors red green orange and you can totally customize the presets so if you want different distortions go for it another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials learn how to use it record some music but you can t save them bummer i know but it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings one last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal about the fender mustang can only use the button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses buttons or up can only be use by fender mustangs up remember this these are the best strings ever i ve tried almost every string on the market and these are by far my favorite they sound great and last forever believe the hype they really do last far longer than any other strings and they sound great while doing it many other strings will sound great for a short while but as soon as they get gunked up they lose any brilliance and tone and become dead sounding not these they will sound great for the life of the string in fact the only way i know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good which they don t but because i ll start having intonation problems and i know the strings need to be changed normal wear and tear does that but these strings last so long i ve tried the polyweb strings from elixir as well but i didn t like those at all to me they didn t feel right sticky or something not like your fingers stick to the strings but like you could tell they were coated with the nanowebs they sound and feel like regular strings but last forever the only string i ll use
110	i had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acoustic electric i was so used to the big klunky ones that you balance on your leg while trying to tune i had no idea these even existed after using it to tune different prospects in a row i decided to buy one on the spot the tuner that is it took another hour to decide on a guitar it is very easy to use the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment i like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there s a drop d song or just tweak something that goes out of tune does exactly what it is supposed to do and it stays out of the way changing strings on a string less often fantastic and the sound is good i didn t expect this much volume from light strings the tone of the strings lasts about months in my experience but that will depend on how much playing you get in wow is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a string endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag you can not go go with a set or two of elixers this is the second clip on tuner i have bought this is much better than the other brand i have it s easy to use and see the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite the built in tap metronome is a cool idea if you re shopping for a tuner give this a try at less than it s a fantastic buy
111	i have about quit using picks now but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses that s what you get with this from very thin and flexible to and hard you get a selection i d first like to say that i bought this guitar on amazon for about a lot cheaper than it s being sold now currently it s a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solidbody but it looks a little different than the picture would lead you to believe for one the guitar doesn t have a finish not even a glossy clearcoat it s solidbody wood sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain secondly the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is the photo shows it looking almost like a red colored wood in reality it s a much darker deep brown akin to coffee this does not however affect its playability which is wonderful i have a bit of buzzing on one fret but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish the guitar can also be strung and tuned easily though with any guitar of this body style you ll have to continually tune and retune until the strings will keep a tuning it s a very heavy sturdy guitar and for a solidbody with two humbuckers you ll likely not find one that sounds as meaty and smooth i cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp i was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound instead i couldn t put it away i must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe the tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing i would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp the v battery holds up well which is surprising considering the drive you got off it so spend the and get something that is a real deal i hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one
112	so far this cable has worked very well it has had no issues at all for the money you cannot even make your own its very easy to install and are very effective in locking the strap to the guitar holds it in place and are of high quality material i recommend it a lot these cables work well in my jam space they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in gig ing but at the price that s fair don t get me wrong these are good cables and for the price i am very happy i d buy more for sure i would probalby uses these for gigging as well if i didn t have heavier duty jumpers available as the title says these are a great value and work well it barely did anything but i guess thats because im the one playing the guitar if you were in another room im am sure that it would make a difference this is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi hat pedal but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top this allows you to either ride closed hi hats when using both bass pedals yet return to normal hi hat playing when the music calls for it be aware that this clutch has only two positions open and fully closed however there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound i did a work around by placing a spring on the hi hat stem with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring which gives me that opening when i drop the cymbal to closed there was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together and i was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound too large or stiff and you will not get the sound however this is all personal preference and many drummers ride a fully closed hi hat anyway which makes this clutch perfect out of the box regardless of your hi hat style if you are using a double bass this is a must have accessory gibraltar s model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time
113	i like this so much i bought and going back for more spring loaded pick holder holds about to picks there is a peel and stick on the back to attach it to a guitar strap or behind the headstock i keep one in each guitar case i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick this switch does work but you should look before you leap the switch travel is greater than it is for a standard way switch and if you use the common fender replacement control plate or one that was only intended for a way switch it may not fit you could fairly easily alter the plate but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate recently i was building a telecaster project a friend recommended using the way switch instead of the stock way switch this allows you to have the three positions normally found on a telecaster bridge only bridge neck in parallel and neck only it also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in series the result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge neck position and a slightly higher top end output this is clearly a case of your mileage may vary i ve been used to the traditional position switch on my other telecasters i m a bit indifferent to this mod if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again it does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the way however i would not change out a working way switch for this for me the added benefit just isn t worth the effort great polishing cloth not much to say here other than it works and works well removes all the fingerprints and polishes my baby up like new after each practice or gig can t go wrong
114	these are nice and this was easily the best price around these are made in japan and i believe they re made for fender by gotoh so they re good quality but i was annoyed that they the bushings didn t fit the standard vintage sized holes in my all parts neck they re a little large so be aware of that looks good but disappointed that they aren t made in the usa oh well just shows me little by little more and more things aren t anymore if you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about digitech effects pedals they ll tell you to stay away from them except for this one that s because the digitech bad monkey tube overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by boss or the ts tubescreamer in fact the ts tubescreamer is the pedal the bad monkey is best compared to this is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock but since the pedal works well as a level gain boost i ve heard of guitarists turning on the bad monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects to really push them to new levels but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the two band eq virtually any distortion pedal has a tone control that will make the tone darker or brighter but since one band eq basically takes away bass to add treble or vice versa you may not find the sound you want that s what s so great about the bad monkey if you feel like your tone is too weak you can fatten it up if it s too muddy you can add treble and you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like construction is extremely durable die cast metal and probably heavier than a boss pedal the switch is more similar to a boss than an ibanez pedal but i find that easier to use if you re a beginning player or a player on a budget this would be an outstanding pedal to own along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal there s really no need to spend the extra money on a tubescreamer if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear but even for player where money is not an object don t overlook the bad monkey it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you ll need i didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted vintage for my relic d build clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on amazon but no worries amazon sells adapters to make the large holes in the neck fit the smaller vintage tuning key posts star off for not looking like the higest quality i m happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price
115	i am a tone freak i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff at the time i had never owned a big muff i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff the difference was huge the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier better looks and function tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides i just put this on my dot hollowbody it s a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job i like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it the price was great had the gibson name on it and was a great value stars i don t have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes but enough to know when i have a winner behringer s tm is made from tough plastic the other beheringers i have had about a year don t look warn and scarred and sound as good as the day i got them the tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones fender clean bright british crunch and distortion a hot gain and sweet smooth california sound i am playing out of a peavey but i hear a tweed amazing clarity and worth the and change you won t be disappointed i did the swap myself in a couple of minutes this are the ping model ratio and they stay in tune just perfect used on an old tiesco size guitar i refurbished for one of my grandsons guitar tuned easy and holds tune well he plays it for hours at a time looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before i replaced it with this one this device sounds okay its usable but you should plan ahead if you re in the usa and want one it ships from mainland china it takes a while to get to the states excellent tone and i m a bit surprised by that i mean d addario strings are fine and all but that s it they ve always just been your average basic string to me these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver i strung up my agile al best les paul copy you can buy look them up with them tuned up and these things roared rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain these strings really do feel and sound great i never thought i d be praising d addario so much but these strings really do deliver bought this switch as the oem for my son s bronco which gives you an off preset preset switching set up simple light and does what its suppose to not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions gives you lots of cable so that it is good and practical for real life gig set ups cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components worth the money i had a hard time lineing them up to install the little knob on them made it very hard to install so good luck i like these pure nickel strings nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners great combo even with ghost bends slides and pounding with drop d and open g tuning if you are replacing your old butterfly trees you can use the same holesclip and sand off the alignment pins as they are not really needed and justadd another hole to your headstock good trees for the price arrived quick these are good replacements or upgrades work much better then the other style of string trees i would recommend this dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it s a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing i can see the merits of screw on locks what with the ease of switching the locks but these work fine for me i have a fender stratocaster mim with standard white pickguard which i changed by a black one then i decided also change others white pieces and this fender accessory kit fit perfect in my guitar i didn t need no adaptation to install it on guitar never really had to mess much with this item its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine these trees came in fender packaging and fit just as the old ones did and look the same they have the same locating pin in front of the screw and are the finishing touch in refurbishing my guitar the lil suckers are all about tuning stability those other style string guides just aren t the same because the string binds too much gave them stars because i don t like the little nibs in the underside i filed them off
116	this is a well made low noise and low cost cable unless you make a lot of money with your recordings this will do just fine decent quality cheap price we ll see how long it lasts but for now does the trick i think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand this is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos and you get free shipping yeah it s not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones but still not bad better than an elastic strap type it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin you can add a pad of some sort or just take care to not to over tighten it i m the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through so far it doesn t look like it will though this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones the plugs are of excellent quality also the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable i urge you to purchase if you are looking you won t be disappointed btw i am a verified purchaser just can t say enough good about this cable i m really impressed i may be a guitar newbie but as far as i can tell this capo is not a fake o piece of crapo dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive come on capos don t have tone just get one that doesn t get in your way also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia did not hold the strings down very well for me i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power fine product i ve been using it for monthno dirty thread or any issue with itleather is bit tough at first time i bought these because i needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board i have the planet waves patch cords called so i thought these would cover it being when i went to hook up they were still too short so i immediately blamed these cords ooooops took out the tape measure so i could complain and found that these are indeed i then measured the planet waves and found they were actually not my bad these seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are if you want to spice up your board go for some color no spill no mess this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag it will not dry out and lasts for years the only thing i don t like is the can will not fit in accessory area of my guitar case and the led has sharp edges so put it down before using the cleaner i love these dunlop capos they are quick to put on grip nicely and above all they don t get in the way of your hand i bought of them from amazon because they were such a good price wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better i bought pack of this and i m still using one so far and is still good nice quality and good price too in years of using many jim dunlop products made in america or to his standards of quality i ve never broken or worn out the capo i use mine on both and string guitars the spring tension remains strong after several years which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing the only problem i have with them they seem to disappear when i m not looking i have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily i have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes this works very well for all of them it s very easy to take on and off and it stays right where you put it the rubber is tough but molds to the instrument i haven t seen and marks or damage from using it works as described for the price i have no complaints at all clamps firmly and easily doesn t move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic after reading many review on my yamaha acoustic guitar i have owned and played for months i finally took the advice of other consumers many people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone this guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was i did put a light set of d addario strings that made a world of difference i was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle wow it really did make a huge difference this guitar is such a quality piece especially for the money but with the string and bone upgrades i can t imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic it changed the tone to that of a classical guitar i am so happy with my changes the high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep the sustain is a drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into the next i am so pleased and excited with my guitar if you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle change them it s a very quick fix and find a nice set of strings the only negative to this well made capo is i wish the tension was slightly less i find that once placed notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure it will work out just fine though and i will just have to make a few adjustments in tuning to correct for this this little snark is easy to carry around and works great i have used several different styles and brands this is a must have for musicians i haven t used it a lot yet but i really like it so far much easier to put on than the year old capo i was using and it works for my guitars and my banjo without putting them out of tune it seems to be solidly made as well and not too much pressure as others said my old capo put a lot more pressure than this does p and was much heavier i d assume it was made out of cast iron or something instead of aluminum when i first learned guitar my buddies kept telling me i d want a capo but i held out until just recently the dunlop is secure doesn t scratch the guitar at all and holds the strings down as it should instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning i can use this to achieve the tone i want good item for the price be careful about using capos like this because if you re using a fine guitar it may damage the finish try it and double check regularly and i wouldn t leave it clamped on the guitar overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand this is a fine product any guitar player has hands strong enough to use it looks great on the guitar and works really well recomended this is a great little uke for the money i ve bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in one suggestion if you re willing to add a bucks to the purchase price buy a set of d addario or aquila strings and put them on right away the stock strings are pretty poor even a set of dollar strings is a vast improvement other than that i love these little guys and plan to keep on buying them finally if you buy this or any other uke do yourself a favor and watch the movie mighty uke you won t stop smiling d addario j ukulele strings sopranoaquila aq s nylgut soprano ukulele stringsmighty uke the amazing comeback of a musical underdog i bought this to go with my shure sm s it fits the mic well no odor effective at suppressing pops great foot switch that is easy to use i figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment wish they had put that in some instructions if it s there i missed it for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do it is very will made has the ernie ball logo on it and works just fine it s nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play a lot of songs say capo preferred it helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on i recommend this product this is not the greatest product they make but it works quickly and makes the string spread when needed to do so more easily than most i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo it works good and that is all i need the fit and finish seems like quality also i ve had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos what the hell anyway this capo works well i ve only used it on gibson and fender electrics and it does a fine job some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off but it does not affect the capo abilities i m sure there are better ones but for me this works well liked the sound the adjustability just wish i could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid i don t care about disturbing the neighbours but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling the rumble is a bit big to take everywhere i made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must i quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something i would use but as i said it s ok simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors haven t used it a great deal but it seems to be great and non damaging to the finish on the guitar the handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo but this is a good choice at a great price this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars i love its size and portability might be my abusive bends though i ll try a ticker gauge next time other than that great strings it s a little harder to open than other capos i ve used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it it s not cheap and flimsy though i don t see this one wearing down anytime soon now stop reading this review and buy this capo you wont regret it this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos i m truly surprised by all the good reviews here i m not sure how it s possible i ve already outlined below in my original review that these are not jim dunlop capos i had purchased two which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring both capos had this very same problem when i received these capos i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand name printed anywhere on the product as a professional musician i need to purchase reputable brand name products because i can t afford to have my gear failing during performances i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand and no measurable reputation when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me this capo is solid and well made i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster no problems at all this thing is a tank i don t think you could break this beast if you wanted to the last string winder you will ever buy its nice and easy to use secures the strings very good and works for all types of guitars with no issues way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic i am a beginner guitar player but i was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers planet waves makes good stuff take the load off your shoulder from that old jazz bass and get a padded inch wide strap it s long enough to allow my bass to rest at arm s length i can adjust it to fit my acoustic guitar which i hold much higher and check out the little pick pocket i like these well enough that i have four of them the bag is simple canvas it probably won t protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional great capo i ve tried a lot of other capos including some pretty expensive brand name capos and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings although it is touted for acoustic guitars it works well with my ibanez electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic electric the spring is tough and it holds securely on and off is a quick process if you have the hand finger strength to operate it i rate it stars only because i just received it and haven t had a chance to use it much but i like it so far it was delivered quickly it does the job i ll update after i ve had it for awhile this a very clever idea it helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space very easy to take off put on high recommend this to any stringed instrument players small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little i wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my sony and korg plug in tuners it clips onto the guitar easily stays put and is not intrusive by weight or size the bars are easy to see and are accurate i purchased a pack of the soft rubber wedgie s as an add on to a larger order as such i found them to be a reasonable value however i m not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic i think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or uke they are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort i love the very soft warm sound they provide i use them mostly late at night when i can t sleep and want to play but the rest of the family is still sleeping not quite as effective on the e a and d steel strings but certainly playable not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords thanks spo i have several of these straps in different colors and i ve never been disappointed it holds my pound les paul with no problems and the first one i bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong if you like the design go for it but for a small woman with small hands it s difficult to operate it also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings which can t be good for them i ordered a schubb brand capo that s much easier to operate and doesn t smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable the only drawback to the schubb is you can t clip it to the headstock a convenience that s important to a lot of professional musicians i m keeping both if i need the convenience of this clip on style i ll use it when playing at home i ll use the more gentle schubb i admit i haven t had it long but so far so good i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out couldn t find another cable so i thought i d find another solution with a more generic cable this joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition which made me a little skeptical i may never need all its features but for what i need powering devices it is doing the job beautifully my pedal board includes tuner chorus and octaver stomp boxes a bass di and a rolls headphone amp the jp frees me up from any other wall warts money now i just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand but i guess that s how all of them are works very well on acoustic guitars
117	i seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i ve been playing guitar for like years these picks are the bomb they don t break on you when you strum too hard fast d i would rate this product stars if i could i m completely satisfied with these picks tip these picks are great for high action high gain guitar solo s sure it s a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it built like a tank but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings i bought this for my brother for a christmas gift when we got him a guitar he never used it but not because of anything to do with the actual product i will keep this short the price is unbelievable it s nice to have three sets in a box and these are the best acoustic strings on the market that s only my opinion and everyone has one so many will disagree i have an regular acoustic and an acoustic electric and strung both with these strings it made each guitar sound like a thousand dollar guitar i find that most inexpensive guitars have cheap strings most can be vastly improved with something as simple as new strings i really believe in these strings when i find a good thing i am hooked and i will not use anything but these on anything acoustic on a guitar strings are everything the tone feel and bend is what s important these are very light and very easy on the fingers unlike clunky stock strings on most acoustics i guess they think you need big think strings to produce volume not so some will disagree saying they break if they re too thin i would rather have a shorter life with strings getting a pure beautiful rich sound than have a long lasting flat string my thick stock strings were killing my fingers these are effortless to play and sound so sweet and mellow just like an acoustic should sound again someone will chime in and bash me for saying this but i would put my inexpensive yamaha up against guitars costing times what i paid i have no plans of changing brands now i ve made the string switch some say thin strings break easily but you should change strings often anyway i can do a string change over in about minutes on a bad day it s worth the effort i don t plan on hammering my acoustic anyway that s what the fender is for and it s not that i m cheap either i own guitars of which are electrics gibson les paul s fender strats one american a couple of dillions another great find and some other nice guitars my acoustic is just an inexpensive yamaha but is a very nice guitar for the money but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin it didn t take me long to throw a set of these on my acoustic electric and got the same results stars in my book more if they d allow that there are no other options unless someone gives me a set that blow me away if you haven t used these picks get some they are the perfect size and shape your really can t beat them it was delivered fast when i hooked it up i didn t expect it to be so loud and clear so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics when i put a wind screen on it the sound was so nice i couldn t stop singing for another hour i only meant to test it when i unpacked it i m buying more at that price it s a steal get a couple now before supply and demand kicks in like other reviewer wrote previously i received less picks than advertised i received a total of picks i don t know if the people at customs borrowed some from me but i find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem other than that the picks are good seem to be durable and produce a nice sound i like the wide for my bass fits nice and made well seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick i have used fender medium picks since the late s yes they are made in china now but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell the picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip lock baggie all were in there all of them fender mediums purchased from b g music associates shipped from illinois to california in days with normal shipping the picks are great and i couldn t be happier with the order whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where i stand recommended if you want need a nice little bag of fender mediums i love this product i t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast so y don t have to life it over your head well worth the price great product accurate small functional inexpensive better battery life to previous generations very good quality adapts easily to any type of guitar heads if you are replacing your old butterfly trees you can use the same holesclip and sand off the alignment pins as they are not really needed and justadd another hole to your headstock good trees for the price
118	the strap is adjustable on both ends and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder i cut it off and glued the material back together with shoe goo and now it s great padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring we bought this for my daughter s boyfriend we saved it as the last gift to give on christmas day he wrapped the strap around his neck and never put it back down i still don t think it has come out of his hands for more than a few minutes i believe he is very happy with his gift i ve had one of these i ve used for years and it has served me well i needed another so that i could get more headphone mixes out of my soundcard for recording multi person bands in my home studio simple to set up you get an input for your source and outputs for people to listen to the source and each one gets to control their own volume i gave this stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating i have nothing to say against the product or the company only that this is not a guitar case it is a mandolin case amazon should correct this stagg stb w acoustic guitar bagepiphone case for epiphone dot sheraton i bought my first one from amazon over a month ago and simply fell in love with it it cleans polishes wood metal although for strings i use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc with wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids i even recently bought a nd just because and yes the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use i knew it was time when it wasn t wiping off the smudges as quickly it came out with a slightly nappy texture to be expected really but still works as well as ever there is a vast amount of different polish cloth brands out there but you won t go wrong with this one
119	i love this now i don t have to find my pick i bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar i also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend i think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class yup it is i would buy again my use is to hold my books while i try to teach myself how to play guitar this stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about high very happy with it just a warning to those that are picky because of the way the tube locks together the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it not an issue for me but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and won t move it would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy buy it you ll like it it will survive a nuclear blast these are a little flubby thick and soft for my taste in guitar picks but they mellow out the tinny sound of my mandolin beautifully the textured grip surface is great so glad i found these three sides much easier for me to hold thin is in as a beginner these make much more comfortable works perfect for guitar strings used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo it has locking tuners so i was able to use this to cut the strings all the way down
120	pretty seems to work fine purchased a pack for my playing buddy he loves fender only way to go will order another set soon very happy with service i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money it securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it very stable base the bottom which holds the guitar can be switched over for different size bases of guitars a good price a good buy glad i invested in it by the way i read several reviews which said this had a smell to it mine does not i just wonder what other people have encountered it has what you want in a cable and not what you don t not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable when i bought my first guitar about months ago i just chose a pack of picks on amazon s list of other buyers also bought this and those were these fender picks at the time i figured all picks were created equal since then i ve tried various sizes and brands dunlop planet waves etc but i keep coming back to this fender medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitar the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddy sounding i ve found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more i bought this harmonica for our son the music enthusiast he loves it it seems to be manufactured well as it is substantive in weight and seems to be solidly built only time will tell but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks couldn t pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price our son says it s easy to use and has a good sound quality hey if it makes our son happy so be it highly recommend i bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capo this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use the c is probably the most universal of all the models this fits a les paul traditional gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar heritage cherry sunburst aprs se custom guitar grey black with tremolo bridge andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar vintage sunburstelectrics the primary use is for a laguna acoustic follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension it s key to not get too much tension we ve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo mostly it goes in a pocket once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesn t clamp tight on the headstock not a huge deal but a consideration well made proven over decades switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement requires less adjustment square pad allows placement right next to the fret easy to adjust with a bit of practice i enjoy using quality machined parts so this is a pleasure plus it is built to last i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a practice cable i can honestly tell a difference that difference being silence no abnormal hissing or popping that i got from my other cheaper cables this isn t the top of the line monster but still a step up from what i d been using i ll definitely upgrade my longer cables to monster and may even see how the expensive one sounds a short one st of course perfect perfect size weight shape i like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds recommended first off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to it holds your guitar one thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly about the effects on finish after googling it calling where i purchased my guitar and reading the little tag on the stand the foam on this and many other stands may affect nitro cellulous laquer finishes how do you know if you have this finish basically the value of your guitar and or the age this finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars it is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at gc told me exactly what i needed to connect distortion paddles to my amp do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers i placed an order threw onlinecarstereo com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones i ve got three of these simply because they work and they re easy to carry from place to place and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this leaning stuff i used to play with celluloid picks back in the s before they came out with delrin i like the sound and feel of these picks they add a nice round sound that works well with jazz and funk they are a little expensive but i think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing i bought the abalone ones because they look cool update i am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines and usually during a performance i have since gone back to delrin and nylon by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing well worth the bucks i paid analog with true bypass easy to use with one knob and has nice high quality chorus effect mxr built like a tank works with my boss ds ac adapter too i m a little surprised at this one just today i was emailed confirmation that the picks were shipped and i found them in my mail box the same day i like fender mediums because i use them on both bass and guitar good picks clean edges good feel good duribility nice tone perfect picks very pretty and nice quality they are not too stiff nor are they too soft i would order these again it s a fender heavy so there s not much else to say about that good price and selection here go for it these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable i wish i d gotten one longer than feet though since i can only play close to my amp with two five footers oh well i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks for a ten spot ya can t do better matte flat black finish is nice great durable foam contact points for cradling baby double dog dare ya to do better you just cannot excellent deal elixir is my favorite brand of strings i bought these seeking strings with longer life after a bad experience w d addario strings only lasted a week or and boy i ll tell you these babies last i only change these strings twice a year the coating makes it more comfortable easier to slide on the strings i love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune they also keep in tune good overall these string are a must try for every guitarist after all the whining i saw about these picks was a little hesitant but bought them anyway it doesn t help that amazon puts most popular posters above most recent so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product i got all of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with picks each so i got my full order in addition i like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones i buy at the local music shop they feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard i am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes these are by far my favorite picks the feedback is good and they re stiff enough to strike clear tones a winner to me wow is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a string endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag you can not go go with a set or two of elixers these are the best celluloid shell colored thin picks around tried all the off brands but came back to fender picks in the end i don t use it for any heavy use i use it for podcasting purposes haven t had any problems so i can t speak to really heavy use of the product elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic they last forever and don t rust they sound awesome get them i was looking for a pedal that didn t take my life s savings and still performed well i found it right here it works well with no problems to report next week i ll purchase another with a different feature it also arrived super fast d addario strings are not my usual strings i have always used ghs and ernie ball strings to my surprise d addario strings are very nice however after years of ghs and ernie ball strings it s tough for me to make a full time change over to d addario strings very good strings i wanted to experiment with a thin pick i like the action but thinner picks tend to click over the strings and i don t care much for that these are certainly pretty though and the feel is typical fender celluloid smooth and a little slippery might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i don t these straps are very good at a low cost i actually like them better than a few high priced straps i have and they re lightweight as well
121	i love being able to adjust the tension does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly then snap it in then turn and turn the screw oops don t let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again what a farce this is the worst capo i ve owned and i ve tried nearly every brand and type yeah i ve had people show me how to do it right and i know to do it right it s just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on snapping it screwing it in screwing it off having it fall off forget it it s garbage to me also while i m getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw it s actually slightly painful to the fingers momentarily but why have to deal with that to work with this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable no thanks great pedal but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods this thing is absolutley rediculous it s a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well color and appearance is a personal thing i think these abalone picks just look cool the color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone fender makes a nice standard pick the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy these mediums work well for playing electric guitar i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex those work well for acoustic i ve used dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the dava rubber coated picks they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick the gray dunlop s don t look anywhere near as cool as these at for a dozen they re worth a try it they don t work out for playing they sure look darn nice the fender logo is in gold dava grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey mm this is the best capo i ve ever owned it s a little awkward in that it doesn t just clip to the headstock with one hand and it takes me two hands also to put it on but not having to retune my string makes it all worthwhile i like the choice of colors too fantastic just love this little amp at first thought it was broken but batteries were not sitting in right very happy it s ok i already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw i like that one more and overall quality seems better on it even though pricing was similar when i bought the first one and the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they don t line up just right but when i put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay and that s the important part easily the best quality capo for it s price looks great on any guitar i came across shubb a few months back when my capo finally gave out after years i bought the c stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars but i had to adjust it any time i went to use it on my les paul which has a s neck and fretboard ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day i just got it in the mail yesterday and it snapped right on the lp with a firm click i didn t even have to adjust it it looks amazing in use and is just the best and simplest design you know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what don t forget to remove it when you guitar is resting it s easy to forget it s there forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos this never effects my fret thumb or forefinger exactly what i was looking for in a capo i will have these for a long time and i m a shubb guy from this day forward
122	this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well try one i think that you will love it if that s what you re looking for for those of you going for the folk singer look or if you re afraid of drilling holes in your guitar this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar i originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that so i tried it out on my string uke and it works just as great it s so much better than the elastic capos so it s doing double duty and going strong quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather does exactly what it s says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price i got this for my ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck it took a few trys before i could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put even so it was a good quality button the leather is tough and will last for years it will probably outlast the guitar if you re looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit but it s really worth the hassle
123	i bought this hoping to use as intended angled into guitar straight into mixer wrong have to use it the other way around sad i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo good strings great strap durable and good lookin it works great for me i like this type of strap s simple durable try one
124	so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors guitar sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great great device and good price my wife made me try this for a gig we had it worked great i love the foggy effect on stage with a touch of lighting it really comes to life the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice i don t know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but i have another can of juice i bought to use later i will report on that i gave it stars although the fog juice is funky because it s not the fog juice that matters it s how the machine works it does what it should do this is supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box i can not comment on this as i have never played this pedal what i can say however with years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal when one takes into account the price it is a great pedal i own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo this has the most distortion it has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock it does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff i have had experience with it is solidly built and apprears road worthy great pedal and great value i would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product the fender vibro champ is a great little amp i m amazed at how good this amp sounds a small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of sound this is a watt tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp this is a much better and louder amp than the small solid state starter practice amps by all the major manufacturers fender uses two very standard tubes for pre and amplification ax and v both are fender branded tubes these are nice clean tubes that react consistently the amp takes about seconds to warm up and draws watts the cool part of this amp is the voice settings in reality the amp packs effects for different amps tweed blackface british hot rod metal jazz and acoustic the first five have three different levels of style each our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack if i m being really honest i like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack this is a clean simple amp to use the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot sadly the volume only goes to once the voice is selected there are effects settings possible with two or three level for each vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the f x level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied set to the effect isn t used at all this is probably the least useful part of the amp there is no pedal selection so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in you re kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again there s no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song there is a gain knob i like the speaker on this amp it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound the internal speaker is connected with a inch jack so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple inch speaker cable very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker the back panel also has a inch jack line out this is a great small gig or practice amp the sound is outstanding the amp is used with a gibson lucille and a les paul standard plus these cables work very well at transmitting sound so why only three stars well these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find these are stiff thick and heavy while that s good for most analog cables these cables are so stiff and heavy that for instance a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there with so many amps having plastic jacks these days you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one i mean let s face it you never know what will happen at a gig sometimes you re playing with a foot cable when you should have a foot cable a cable shouldn t come out because of a gentle pull but if it s between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it you want the cable to fall out if everything you have is heavy or velcro d to the ground this isn t a problem but it is for me i feel like when you re playing with these cables you re worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out but because it s seriously like a trip wire out there lastly these plugs are huge that s not really a problem if you play a strat or a tele but what about a p bass or a j bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body this is going to stick out a lot and to loop it around your strap it s going to be a huge stiff cumbersome loop i know people often buy degree plugs for those kinds of instruments but most normal straight plugs do just fine so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables you ll thank me these cables are just poorly thought out they d work great as patch cords or keyboards drum machines from pedal board to amp as long as you have a metal jack monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use and at that price pro co cables are also excellent and they have brand name plugs as well
125	i ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on it s especially effective when the microphone is on my desk where my computer tower which has fans is directly under it it s not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing on top of all that it looks nice too if you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk you should definitely consider getting this along with a solid stand and a pop filter i have one gig bag already not like this fender and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar i bought this fender is lots better then my other bag my other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this fender bag the finder s padding is a bit better than my other bag also but of course neither is as good as hard case i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg i need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar because i use crutches and they require my hands the fender s straps are great the left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty wompass and it became difficult for me to carry the straps on this fender stay put love it the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd but it can also my blueridge br or my seagull s coastal spruce either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly like i said its a great gig bag if i ever need another i ll be getting another fender gig bag good cords with a decent length i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box i order the longer cord to go to my wah pedal which i always set outside of my pedal board works quite well i m never playing another guitar without these locks after my custom telecaster fell the neck went out of wack i had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again that s every musician s nightmare i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps schaller kept coming up i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use one issue you may run into is the nut running loose that s not a problem with the scaller locks it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily i am a tech as well as a guitar player i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections most of us know by now that there s a lot of hype but it really comes down to good quality cable this seems to be good stable connectors these seem to be the connections between the two that last time will tell all i know is i have hand soldered special plugs with good cable to only have them break with use and i expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged unplugged often i do know these are signal clean do not bleed f highs that is critical in my book they are very easy to use can be done on stage between or before sets very quickly and with no soldering i love that i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem lm i compared this cable to the monster studio pro cable i also own i prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it i got replacememts over years worth the higher price because of the warranty the dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording note this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it
126	nice cables so far i ve not had any problems with them but haven t put them through a lot of use just yet also have the planet waves custom series cables that work just as well for less money i ll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other this is a star stand considering the price sure it s not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what it s supposed to do without any problems i don t forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough it s a music stand so i don t see how it would take a lot of abuse i thought i was using good guitar cables but i kept getting intermittence with one so i tried this monster cable it eliminated the problem my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff this is minor but no matter what i do it curls up unless you have it fully extended i would still recommend it though this cable is extra heavy not like the cheaper ones the plugs are of excellent quality also the sound that transfers through this cable is remarkably improved over my old cable i urge you to purchase if you are looking you won t be disappointed btw i am a verified purchaser just can t say enough good about this cable i m really impressed unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints dust oxidation squeaks or gummy areas or drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new i don t like greasy feeling products on my guitars so dr duck ax wax is designed for my needs i threw out my gibson spray too oily dr ducks wax is worth the extra this bottle will last a lifetime you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish these cables are perfect the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent i really love monster cables
127	bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price i am a tech as well as a guitar player i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections most of us know by now that there s a lot of hype but it really comes down to good quality cable this seems to be good stable connectors these seem to be the connections between the two that last time will tell all i know is i have hand soldered special plugs with good cable to only have them break with use and i expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged unplugged often i do know these are signal clean do not bleed f highs that is critical in my book they are very easy to use can be done on stage between or before sets very quickly and with no soldering i love that i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem lm this power supply is unbelieveble versatile when i first saw this i believed it was only for pedals but it turns out it can power up a lot pedals better than any power supply out there this power up my pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more im buying more and it will work only with this thats why i say this is the best on the world this is definately worth the money i was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all bought another one for my friend i bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after uses the wood looks great again i used the honey twice in days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier i saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after i bought this but i do not use it much so it should last a long time i purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive epiphone les paul jr which fits perfectly as does a squier strat on the plus side the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some but not a lot of abuse the reason i claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear that should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this one other issue i ve had with the case is i left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges especially the lip around the top of the case again this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot enclosed space for prolonged periods for inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument it is perfect for occasional gigging but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road i would not hesitate to purchase another one if i acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because i do like the better protection this particular case provides very well made no problems should be able to stand up to any use or abuse when you extend it out all the way it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom but other than that this stand is perfect
128	i have a rose gold plated flute and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating this does the job perfectly wipes off fingerprints smudges easily and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate is easy on the plating and very gentle washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries am very pleased bought this switch as the oem for my son s bronco which gives you an off preset preset switching set up simple light and does what its suppose to not built like a tank but better than the cheap after market versions gives you lots of cable so that it is good and practical for real life gig set ups cable and plug are solid thick fender quality components worth the money i bought one of these about a year ago and i am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a back up great tuner just clip it on the headstock turn it on and tune display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so i can even do it without my glasses on i have used it in noisy environments other instruments tuning or playing and it still works never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or fender stratocastor the only thing that could use improvement is the auto off function mine has failed to detect an extended duration of no audio energy and as such stayed turned on until it drained the battery after that i got in the habit of making sure i turned it off when not in use and it uses commonly found cell batteries so not a big deal to replace just grab a two pack of them at the grocery store to keep on hand overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
129	great sound and sensitivity very well made these should last a lifetime barring any physical damage made in the usa to boot these may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny quiet almost hum free clear respose no volume control doesn t befront me because i use it to record to play thru a pa where either i or someone else keeps the volume under control it tends to be bass heavy but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that i had used one in the past this is a more solid unit fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar also in two others i use here and there great job great value got herre quick in a nice little carry bag i will update if problems come later don t see why or how tho after experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a stevens steel bar for lap playing and a dunlop glass over the finger slide for spanish style playing i decided to try the dunlop harris tapered brass slide it s probably a personal issue but i much prefer the weight of the brass slide the taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control this slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it the material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses another practical plus for the brass slide is that i don t have to worry about what would happen if i drop it in short it s a winner i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone it matches the mic well color wise and fit the c fits the mount perfectly i recommend this mount highly http www amazon com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c the pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable anyway the pickup sounds very nice and i m happy easy to use no metallic hiss you d normally expect the only real drawback is the lack of presence when it comes to the bassier strings it takes some skill to eq things to the point of normalcy if you re uncomfortable dealing with eq this might not be your best bet otherwise a wonderful product at a great price
130	zero issues with this cable so far it feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in unplugging and packing between practice spaces i ll update this review if when it breaks this is my first fatso flex cable i think i ve had spectraflex cables before and they ve been fine but i ve owned lost lent etc so many over the years i can t recall the look and feel of this cable is excellent seems very solid but it s always difficult to tell with cables i like the flexibility much better than my monster cable which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic it sounds fine no issues i m not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about high end cables being necessary get something decent that isn t noisy and the tone comes from you and your equipment no issues in that regard with the fatso one last thing you ve gotta love amazon i got a red and a violet for each while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more so i wasn t choosey about the colors i got they look great though oh and one thing i m a bit iffy about is spectraflex s lifetime warranty the fine print requires a sales receipt bs imo and says something to the affect of we will decide if we will replace it so way what you will about monster but they ll replace anything with no receipt which is more reasonable i think but i ll worry about that when it s time to worry about it but it s worth considering as the return process might not be exactly hassle free when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it at first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and i figured the plastic would soon break i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either i have used this for a couple of months now switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well i may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner it works as well as my expensive model i was using and i don t have to stick it on the guitar body worth checking out my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs but i know several people who have had problems with the switch and i have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my st wah but i am not sure that i am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance i kinda think i am the vox and bbe seem to have a brighter sound which is less wah ed if you will it could be accentuated by me playing a strat instead of the les paul custom boogie combination i used with the crybaby these are great strings they are the right length and go on easy enough they are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren t color blind they go on sound bright and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever you only have to change them every months or so i had to reply that forever just doesn t last as long as it used to changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so less that is a good deal even if they don t last forever that means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book worth the extra pesos this capo seems to handle quite nicely spring loaded trigger like a kyser still my personal fave but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring in time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune the only issue if you could call it that was that i have always used the kyser s that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one after many years of playing muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction one of the features i like is that it just doesn t take up too much room and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand we opted for the world tour guitar gig bag over a hard case because most of the time my son s guitar is hanging on the wall usingstring swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary this case is generally good quality and meets our needs with the following observations pros lightweight doesn t add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar good quality strong material stitching and zippers storage pockets big enough for music pages picks and a small electronic tuner handles good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapscons limited protection this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact appearance this is not awe inspiring to look at being very basic and the world tour logo looks a little cheesy this was a good choice for the limited light use it gets from us recommended cfh simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capo this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use the c is probably the most universal of all the models this fits a les paul traditional gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar heritage cherry sunburst aprs se custom guitar grey black with tremolo bridge andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar vintage sunburstelectrics the primary use is for a laguna acoustic follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension it s key to not get too much tension we ve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo mostly it goes in a pocket once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesn t clamp tight on the headstock not a huge deal but a consideration got the pack and oh what a great difference on me my guitar and my sound i m a yo newby to guitar this proves that easy helps i have a big baby taylor and when i needed new strings i went to the wrong place got martins installed wow did they make a bad diference to me sounded like a s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play my friend said that he uses d addario and that they make all the difference in the world tried them and he was right i changed my own on the big baby and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position instead of switching the e and b string like the dealer did my taylor recommends elixr but the d addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers taylor ships this guitar with these strings and for a good reason they sound wonderful right out of the box like with most all string guitars lights or extra lights are most often appropriate the feel of these nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate in tandum with the instrument bring out it s best resonance and sustainability give em a try the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life this is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural life i e that brightness that new strings have the drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings so are these any good yes they feel great not overly slippery or coated and sound great though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings i m excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player i change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer about gauge these light strings go from to as compared to my old martin s which went from to in summary d addario makes good strings and these are no exception if you re looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted as opposed to aggresive tone with lighter low e then you should check these out i recently sent two of my ovations back to the factory in connecticut for re work i just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them as soon as i took them out of their case and strummed them i immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings i ve ever played what exactly are they i might experiment with the exp s but by and large these exps are my new strings for years i used kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue planet waves ns has a smoother handle that doesn t stick out as much and i ve had no issues with gripping it on or off so far it is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly if you re looking to buy a capo i d recommend this over a kyser these patch cords work like a champ i use them with my pedal board and haven t any issues with signal quality they give some versatility in their length i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much the colors well ok they re a little odd but for the price i dealt with it i have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road i have not had this long enough to know if it will but so far so good i ve used this pedal with a casio px keyboard for about weeks now pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards polarity switch i was using a yamaha fc with an older keyboard but the fc does not work properly with the casio keyboards it s a tip negative polarity and the privia requires a tip positive polarity so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed thankfully the sp has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard cord is long enough con build quality is slightly less than the fc the fc has a smooth action made in japan but the sp had some problems with the metal spring squeaking some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking the sp also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal overall it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals i use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars good brand and good tone stars for this one d addario guitar strings are favourite strings they last a little longer and always sound good on my ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned i ve been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while but i was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i ve been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller i was intrigued by the promise of long life though i have a taylor big baby that i bought used and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didn t sound at all like old strings this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new i d just changed the strings on my s gibson gospel a week ago so i decided that would be my reference the nanowebs went on my s guild d both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars the gospel is a bit brighter sounding but i m pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars if they d sounded dull i d notice as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled light gauge they had a e string something you d be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings the b was a compared to the of the d addarios i usually play the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges turns out that these are hd light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end the difference shouldn t be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d so how do they sound the unwound e and b don t sound different from any other plain steel string of course the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer when i switch between the d and the gospel sound wise i d say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day i wouldn t call them dull by any stretch of the imagination if i didn t know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn t be able to tell from playing them so they re good sounding strings and they last a long time that leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings here s the way i see it if you re a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not you re probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination but if you re a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run and if you re a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice for myself i m going to leave these on the d for as long as they still sound good i ll update this review when i find out just how long they do last follow up after playing these for a few days i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars they sound great on the loar and now i have two guitars to do a long term test on in my years of playing the guitar i have settled on d addario as my string of choice when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy i m really glad i did the tone is great they re durable and smooth on the fingers even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell like tone that mandolinists are after they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock i have a high end washburn f style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good this is the pack to get thanks d addario for providing an awesome product i have used this on my les paul it proved to be very functional the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact this one is harder to lose because of its size i also appreciate the even tension across the strings much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings i bought my son a thousand dollar epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for christmas i told him an expensive one was not in our budget we went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one the sound was absolutely fabulous much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one the store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well in my opinion this was as good as other brands costing three times as much i m not sure how takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money but if you re looking for a starter guitar or just looking to add another guitar to your collection this would make an excellent choice i inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price we also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs thejasmine by takamine s acoustic guitar natural i had for years been using elixir strings on mywashburn d simply because i was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch i m glad i tried out these d addario strings these strings are an excellent complement to my washburn which has mellowed out over the years they are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the elixir strings i can t speak to the manufacturers claim of times more life but as of now i d have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money highly recommended i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone the exp s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow bodied ovation however i have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different while i was not expecting it my favorite aspect of the exp s is the playability the play is a little more elastic than i thought it would be and they are amazingly easy on the fingers the only downside that i experienced with the exp s is the fact that while giving once on the guitar they are a little brittle off the guitar i almost snapped my e getting it set up other than that the strings are just a little squeaky i personally like a little squeak but at the current price point i don t think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don t i ve been playing guitar for years and personally i would prefer cleartone or elixir strings i bought these for my little sister and she loves them they have a really nice sound to them i feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this i got it for my son and he wasn t impressed does not have good sound but hey if you re just wanting a toy go for it i have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups some peope miss the quack electric guitar type sound from these other types i do not i also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified nor is any battery required i run it through a baggs para acoustic preamp or my fishman aura it really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly product was delivered safely and promptly these strings sound great i love the sustained bright tone they work well with my cedar top guitar easy on the fingers too shipping the epiphone comes wrapped in protective foam inside a gig bag which is inside a sturdy standard tri shaped box which is itself shipped inside a huge box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic that huge box is then inside yet another huge box honestly to protect this better they d have had to contact tony stark it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping excellent job stars on that alone size overall length fretboard nut to bridge so good overall medium size i like that it s a bit larger than a soprano uke it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano frankly i d like to see a baritone version the length is an excellent size for both adult and youth child fingers quality from stern to port this instrument shines beautifully lacquered flawless finish protective edging plastic finger guard which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic solid neck screw joined to heavy wood body the whole unit is heavy wood and very durable nevertheless the sound is quite good the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes the amp jack is chrome metal back plated to the body it s not coming loose strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle and of course the impressive epiphone and les paul signature stamps on the head for sheer class sound i found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box despite the fact it s pretty solid wood electric i expected it to sound dull it doesn t but i still bought a set of d addario strings a brand i ve loved for years and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added action i ve rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception the action is fairly high not uncommon with off the shelf instruments one will need to remove the strings keep them for emergency spares file down the bridge bottom easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper and add a new set of quality strings i m a perfectionist when it comes to action as are most players i know so this will be tweaked durability it s very durable that counts for the gig bag too no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing as others mentioned i d still look for a decent hard case they average under a good instrument is worth protecting but i d say this could take some real punishment and still play well not that i d go bashing it against a stage floor that would be goofy weird suggestion hang on to the box it comes in it makes a great temporary hard shell case it s made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke great for hauling around in your car if you can t shell out for a shell seriously that is some stiff cardboard protects well electronics the sound is clear sadly there is no volume tone control no battery to preamp and thus the signal to the amp was quite low they could have done better on that end but wow at this price how can one gripe two solutions to this open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible that s the tricky way put a preamp on this you can buy one here on amazon for about bucks if you have a mini mixer you can do the same thing with that even with that little extra expense you ll come out ahead aside from the passive electronics this is a prime instrument it is a mid size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano if you re careful and don t tune it too quickly or a baritone guitar th st string e high depending on the strings you choose considering what you get for the price i don t think this can be beat unfortunately my extra long fingers find this very difficult to play something i didn t consider when ordering a uke but that s a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument the product itself is excellent okay mine has just arrived so first of all i want to say packaging is great i have just put it on my guitar and i have to say that i am impressed the sound is so warm and bright i have a nanoweb before and so far the exp is better i will stay on with the exp right now great quality string it does a fair job but i have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes i actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate
131	this little stand is great i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar it is light non obtrusive holds the guitar well and it is portable when mr guitar and i take a trip together i highly recommend it keeps that guitar off the bed floor table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be this ultex jazz it s very cool your durability is very high and i m feel very comfortable to play with it this is the best case ever for the money i have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the gator deluxe i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week a friend and i have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing restoring older guitars my friend had a tele custom made for him and needed a case so i ordered this one and it hits the spot the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesn t move at all my buddy likes the case so i am happy nothing gets stars there are no generals present i recently traveled across country carrying similar guitars one was in the skb fender case on amazon the other in this gator case purchased locally i was told it was just as good as the fender case both ended up in checked luggage after flight from florida to lax and back non stop minimal handling the glue on the top section gave up the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape but after having the padding fall out i just ordered another skb fender case the gator will be re glued and used only for local trips the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on
132	i used to swear by hard and stiff picks on my les paul custom but i recently bought a strat re issue and these are too mucch fun for fast rhythms with a wah or phase phaser pedals i read the reviews of the few similar options i went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean not much of that complaint here but this definitely has that problem my guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes so this can t go in several out of the way places i had hoped would work also i was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact guitar rack however the angle makes that very awkward i hope to modify it to work but i m not super hopeful at this point will probably have to manufacture something to replace it i have been in need of a tuner for far too long i was turned on to this and i was truly blown away the tuner is very accurate and compact i leave it on my guitar all the time the clamp is strong enough that it will stay put well built and solid stand it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar this stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars which should last a long time it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars highly recommend it i ll be honest here i bought this one primarily because of its looks not a lot of white clip on tuners around i also own an sn and in comparing the two the sn seems to be as tight but it s only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the sn which has more features for a few dollars less than what you re paying for the sn still it s a typical snark it registers very quickly it s easy to read and you don t have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration the stem on mine is a little looser than i would prefer but it still stays in position my only real gripe isn t unique to this model but to all snarks the curved stem combined with the round head means it won t sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren t exactly robust so i m always concerned that one day i m going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces other than that i d recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner
133	wish i discovered these years ago comfortable and the grip works wonders nice clear tones with this pick tips thanks after years of buying stands all i can say is that i should have invented it myself i have many expensive guitars and i wouldn t use a inexpensive stand before i found this design so if you re shopping and wonder if it s really good you can trust me because i m way over qualified to pass judgement on this and i care about guitars and about amazon shoppers i have an older version of this model but it works great i opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that i got from home depot hangers rated to hold up to lbs each equals lbs worth of peace of mind the hanger itself that i bought was used so it was already assembled so i can t comment too much on the assembly process i bought of them and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry free security and no i don t own stock in the company i decided to get this tweed strap for my s telecaster classic but when it arrived i was a bit let down the tweed finish is cool enough but the strap is very thin and the strap ends are pretty poor quality if they truly are made of leather i feel sorry for the hide they came from the leather is so hard you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locks this is decent for the time being but i am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar feels like wearing a casio with a suit i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar it works perfectly super stable and doesnt take up much space for the price i don t think it can be beat i own dunlop kyser and g th nashville capos i don t like the direction the dunlop faces it seems awkward the kyser spring is very poplar but i think the spring tension is too strong making it harder to take on and off and i think it makes the strings a little sharp i like the g th nashville capo but the spring tension is inconsistent the used to be softer maybe too soft but the lastone i bought was almost as still as the nashfille ths planet waves ns artist capo is similar to the kyser and nashville capos but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations only downside is i think the nashville capo looks better this is one awesome guitar i also purchased the fender mustang i amp epiphone custom case fits like a glove and planet waves planet lock leather guitar strap comfortable and very secure which made for an unbelieveable combination along with rocksmith i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination the only problem in my household is who gets to play next in my band we have a song where i use a kazoo for one song and i needed a way to store it until needed this cup holder does the trick it also holds my water bottle with no problem the problem is it doesn t do both at the same time that s on me this is a good product for what it does
134	i ve used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting this one is the worst the plastic screw yes plastic that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to is completely incapable of supporting it s own weight at nearly any angle bad just bad secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement after twisting on it twice i stripped it out now the thing is worthless i m returning it asap i would rather go to a lady s bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady pop filter if you don t you ll wish you did a nice addition to my recording home studio i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music not easy to set up hard to tighten down works well enough as a filter once you get it placed so i bought this to replace the original string winder i had that doesn t have a clipper on the end and it turned out great the clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better thank you planet waves perhaps more than anything else it was the introduction and subsequent success of the zoom h personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi professional level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user friendly equipment at reasonable prices the price of the samson meteor usb mic a fairly recent entry has come down to the point of being fairly valued initially i was seeing it going for prices above the better sounding blue yeti mic it s an attractive some would say cute little mic with its quaint retro design and deceptively fold up portable size i say deceptive because due to the non adjustable mic stand it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop next to a computer and squarely in front of the narrator s mouth bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound it s good but nowhere close to studio quality it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking high fidelity audio to spend the extra for a blue yeti or an audio technica at usb as tempting as the lower price of the non usb version of the at is be sure to try it out with a pre amp supplying phantom power before going that route i ve known a couple of individuals who ordered the at condenser mic only to discover that it was useless with a computer even with the addition of a snake light cable if your primary considerations are convenience and portability the samson go mic sounds almost as good as the meteor and is unmatched in size convenience and portability it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions i m tempted to say it s the perfect laptop mic clipping to the top cover more securely than the snowflake whereas the yeti is ideal for desktop use producing rich sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio s shure sm b mics i love a lot of danelectro products but not really this one i give it because it works as advertised the features are good true bypass requires a v wall plug and adjustments are good but here s my issue the distortion is not crunchy it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional it has no depth to it thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres but i play a lot of blues rock i ended up switching to a vintage tube overdrive by behringer not for me maybe for you
135	not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic pivots in direction only not the best build quality in the world actually fairly thin plastic but for what else can you ask for should last a few months at least if you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these they are well made and do work i would buy them again not happy with the sellers description or the product the description says heavy duty which makes you assume that it s a regular hard plastic mic clip but it s not it s rubber it sucks used it a couple times and it s hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it s probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly and flex it s flexible who uses flexible mic clips make sure you don t buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead its poorly made with attention to detail i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon but they will not screw down all the way and are losse it is useless other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine
136	i ve been buying gear from alto music since i ve trusted them with my guitars and they ve helped me make the right decisions for my needs and budget last year i bought a set of fender custom shop texas specials directly from alto s web site over the past year i received a bunch of amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a shure sm b when i saw that i could get the mic from alto music it was a no brainer i was purchasing from my local music store through amazon as for the mic it s an sm b and it s everything i was looking for despite it being a low output mic it s smooth has a sexy low end color has no harshness brittleness or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers i m recording in an untreated basement and this mic is perfect for when i m singing loud rock stuff it only picks up what s right in front of it and none of the room i m using a focusrite i which is great for loud singing but i m picking up a cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well for me the mic has been all it s cracked up to be when i ordered these i wasn t expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly foot cable it turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all i plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static interference or buzz to explain the low price and all i got was a nice clean signal highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable you are looking at what i consider to be the best friend a voice ever had during a year broadcast and voiceover career i have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the shure sm b and it s predecessors the sm and sm large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi track studio work i ve used over the years the sennheiser md ev re ev re n d shure sm b shure sm shure sm and most recently tried a heil pr sometimes this was not of my own selection but i just used what was available of the lot the shure sm b is my favorite of the ones still available the sm b is a better shielded sm and the sm b of today has a better shock mount than the old sm or earlier sm b the shielding in the b model minimizes rfi from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc the sm was a redesign of the sm i consider the sm to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn t been in production in ages i have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the rca dx and rca but they were not as good as the sm or sm or sm b today s sm b is the best non condenser vocal microphone still in production stop looking and buy one you will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the ev s i can play a sm b like a violin the others i just don t seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an sm b while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn t dj s change jobs a lot and i got tired of finding the ev re re n d mics or the sennheiser everywhere i went so i bought my own sm b i never liked the ev s or sennheiser much and didn t ever feel like they were much of a tool the heil pr is pretty good but doesn t have any on board eq options for recording not having the eq is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can t do much of that the sm b is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an re n d but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the sm b is only dynamic large diaphragm mic i know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work the others are more versatile but the sm b is the voice microphone and that was all it was intended to be it has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphone of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably that is one reason vocals sound good on a tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multi frequency overtones of the human voice unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn t intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise if you are doing a dry voiceover you can t hide the hiss of a condenser under something else with the sm b you don t have to even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves recording engineers today are usually totally ignorant about they figure anything short of a multi thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong if you want a good all around microphone this is not it if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is as others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear i ve ever connected to it i think if you have some cheap usb interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers most real studio preamps are a good match for it i ve plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too you need at least db of gain the spec sheet actually says db would be better lots is made of the low output of db but it isn t all that much less than the shure sm which is db db isn t much at all for any decent mic preamp but again most of the one box solution usb interfaces with built in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind the shure sm b comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra they all need an external windscreen but only the sm b comes with one i got mine years ago when it still came with two windscreens it has a nice metal case for storage travel i think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one shure calls the a ws but still come in the metal case i use the smaller windscreen mostly and shure calls them the rk and their distributors still carry them the smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and i d suggest getting one of the rk s but that is the only accessory you ll need to add the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged they are also very durable for foam screens on the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple eq adjustments for flat bass rolloff presence boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best you can just leave the plate off if you want this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic so i m just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work i should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new heil pr first to make sure i was still an sm b guy and it took a while for the heil tryout to happen since i didn t want to actually buy one i still am an sm b guy i would give it stars but it won t let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class i rounded it up to stars but the sm was actually a bit closer to a star vocal mic so i am a big fan of the sm microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality i have a bunch of the large style condenser microphones rode nt a at sp c and they are clear but so sensitive that it s difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room so if you re like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing you should try a dynamic mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little i did an a b test against the sm b i just bought and the sm i love for vocals with the exact same processing chain cable settings etc and just switched the mics out i sung the same passage as well and i have to say the sm sounds muddy in comparison to the sm b if i didn t have this new microphone i would still like the sm but the genni is out of the bottle now so not going back the sm b is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well dynamic singers rock jazz gospel opera if you have the budget get this sm b and if you don t buy the sm until you do have the budget quiet singers acoustic folk if you sing softly all of the time you really don t need one of these dynamic mics and would be better off with the standard large condenser mics as listed above of those type i like the studio projects c best i think but they are close i m a keyboard player and in the past i had been spending for monster s delegated keyboard cables but suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use causing me to question the monster mystique i began to compare the monster keyboard cables with cheap off brand guitar cables and couldn t hear any difference no question it s a well made trustworthy but not indestructible or infallible cable but i m no longer committed to it at any price however at amazon s current value price for this particular monster cable it s a no brainer moreover i no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn t say piano or keyboard on it one of my monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club as for length feet is ideal if you re playing through your own amp my preference if you re plugging into a board or p a system you ll want anywhere from feet to feet what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal right at the upper lip works well for me the bass cut and presence boost are convenient use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids flat s where it s at flat sounds most natural being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might though it takes eq well and you can eq that in if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix so what does it sound like the sound is very natural and true to my voice it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic this thing is heavy and rugged the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one but since my room isn t perfect this will do the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser it really does of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well seriously a db shelf in the highs another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest
137	dunlop always makes top notch products so when it came time to find a slide i knew where to look this one produces a great tone and is well made like the other reviewers mention here you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits for general home use though i wouldn t worry about it too much though i don t know if its me but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on i use this for booster really sounds good use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp also it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedal i recomend this one the locking tuners are a great add to my strat they went on easily but i noticed they are staggeered so make sure the the taller tuners begin at the low e after the install i stringed it up and played for a couple of hours cosmetically they do look cool and functionally which of course is the purpose they keep it in tune i am not a big trem guy but when i use it i do not now have to worry about its tuning these are great patch cables they make a strong connection between pedals and don t sacrifice any sound quality i ve been using many of these every day for quite a while and they are still working great its a windscreen this is the first one i have bought but it seems to work how it is supposed to it could be less dense i think idk
138	this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it the only minor problem i have it with it is that it begins to get a little wobbly once you start to bring it near it s max height very close to the sound of an sm not quite as warm as the shure but this mic has the best sound for the price i m very impressed its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin came with a few which is nice price was right so why not go for it all of the pd dw products i ve bought have been amazing from stands to thrones etc this stand is an amazing value and provides a lot of flexibility when mounting your cymbals solid too
139	i needed a solid throne to replace my ikea computer stool i ve been saddled with for the past year the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should i don t have any long term usage to report but i ve seen reviews complaining the stool eventually loosens and will rotate which would be annoying if true but at this fairly low price point you can t complain about much and it s better than the real cheap thrones this stands up and holds the microphone in place the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall if you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good tight spacing i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn t be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures so i will have to do new pictures but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack decker bdl av all in one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about minutes i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional looking installation as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shape i do not however recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately edit i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in it took about minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line at any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne the only issue i have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post not a big deal
140	these are pretty good quality tweed cables i prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs they also make one with the degree inch input as well the reverb broke in my amp and i tried the boss frv to replace it and didn t really like it too much then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby this is exactly what i wanted it fills out the sound and yet doesn t add any artificial high end sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement for most songs it s always on and it really excels at vintagy sounding stuff like rockabilly and surf the mod button is a nice add on but i haven t really bonded with it yet if i had to buy this over again i might consider the aqua puss because i don t use the high delay times all that much and the aqua puss has an easy access battery door this tuner is awesome and accurate very noticeable and what else can i say for the price best deal ever get it ps i use it for my base though satisfied thanks korg i use to tune with an antique korg i saw these baby on the road with maroon s james just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect best distortion i ever used it took me a while but i finally got that preriphery protest the hero tone with this plus my overdrive works great very good feel we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetmy wife loves it if i needed two i would buy another
141	recently i was looking for some heads to put on a set of starion shells that i modified my original plan was to use a set of attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells that decision was based mostly on price not completely though as i have used the attack heads for resonant heads with very good results the attack heads that i bought though are single ply to me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but i think a two ply head is better for a batter head i gave the attacks a shot on both sides but i wasn t completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to go in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively i still very much like the remo pinstripe heads but decided to give these evans heads a try just to try something different i am very happy i did these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance the most noticeable difference between these g s and the attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated the g s seem to resonate everywhere from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance i have some moon gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound by adding removing or moving the moon gel pads around i can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tune i should mention that i am still using the single ply attacks for the resonant side with the g s on top and the attacks on the bottom these shells sound great also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides i also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing so the attacks have their place but on the batter side i am very impressed with the sound tuning range and ease of tuning of these g s if you ve never tried them give them a shot if you have you likely already know what i m talking about just assembly for a try only few rolls with music it s had some hole on head that s mean bad quality buyer beware for this kind of i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone these are very well made with the heads well secured the plastic is thick and of a nice material the cables come with a massive year warranty so i m sure they re not going bad anytime soon buy with confidence this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all cymbals that i possess and use very brilliant and resonant definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price trust this cymbal once and you won t be disappointed it lasts a pretty long while too it s a thin splash so it does tend to break after about months of use er so but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there all in all i definitely recommend trying this product
142	i ve been using a crybaby for going on years now some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way well i ve never noticed to me these always feel perfect also you can adjust which part of the sweep you re using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the pot i ve tried other wahs morley doesn t do it for me and the vox is very good i just have always gone with what i knew no complaints with the crybaby i bought of these for live recording of my band they adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding i recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage features stable base good extension easy hand grip to lock unlock for adjusting for me it was a good perchase i ve used this for about months now no malfunctions looks good works fine no complaints what more can i say i was really looking forward to receiving this amp i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight unfortunately from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser like effect to the sound i tried different basses with it i tried different cables with it i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase shifter sound came out i tried all different knob and eq settings as well nothing helped so i m returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don t think less of ampeg at least not yet i really hope it s a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful for it s packed with cool features like an effects send a cd in a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice it also just looks cool and very pro my intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here i have to say buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label if there is a choice between amazon com and other vendors and even if amazon is a couple bucks more i recommend using amazon the customer service is so easy and immediate it s worth the piece of mind i ll update this review when i get the new amp later this week i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received see below
143	this little stand serves so many purposes for me at home it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when i want to test out different pedal configurations at my gig it holds my presonus mixer a laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers it is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide and short or tall as well i have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it i plan on using this one day to hold my ableton live machine as well as a small octave keyboard and i will use the mic boom arm at that point even as a keyboard stand i like it because i can put pedals underneath it with it fully extended to long mode i can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it of course that is solid inches of stage front though which is indeed a lot for the small places i fit into with my duo it works great for five of my lower power pedal type items including my line wireless receivers shure wireless receivers and several other pedals like my cry baby etc all at once however the transmitter for my shure wireless in ear monitor which requires less power than any of the other two items combined will not run even by itself when powered by the spot switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own and there is probably some little quirk in the shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn t get along with for most of my stuff it works great and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords i was leery of this since it was half the total price of just about every other one i considered because of the return policy i took a chance and am not only glad i did but am also thoroughly impressed with this hanger first i doubt if i could build one for anywhere near the price of this if i purchased the materials locally factor in that shipping at the time of my purchase is free and this is a no brainer installation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hanger there is one concern you may have if you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes personally mine are being used to hang a cheap squire strat and j bass and an epiphone les pail junior ii instruments more decorative than functional i am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decision the bottom line though is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain in fact they are probably the best deal you are likely to find and are worth every cent i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap sm wannabe from radio shack i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then i can easily position for use with a generous inch reach definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient just what i needed okay well i lied in subject line bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand i can say that with authority since i run kj shows nights a week and have for the last years so i know good singers when i hear them and they will ask if i have a shure sm to which i reply hell no you think i m going to put a in the hands of a careless drunk the more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic i d rather lose one of these behringers than a or a wireless sound wise these are great for their intended purpose if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain i have a crowded rig already and the las thing i wanted was another mic stand i already have a straight stand with a shure sh mounted on it as a talkback to call tunes to my band members i wanted to eliminate my wireless sax mic as i was using it infrequently and decided to mount a heil fin on this extension arm on the same stand as the talkback nice and stable no issues works perfectly haven t had this long but so far it s just about perfect i had bought another on stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness on stage my see review this one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable and only costs a few bucks more fourteen buckos at present i ve got a gooseneck and a light ish condenser mic with a shock mount on it and it s as steady as can be i m convinced even heavier loads will be no problem if you re in need of a side boom look no further
144	these wires definatly change the sound of the snare drasticly improving sound as well as looks very satisfied with my purchase i think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class yup it is i would buy again my use is to hold my books while i try to teach myself how to play guitar this stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about high very happy with it just a warning to those that are picky because of the way the tube locks together the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it not an issue for me but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and won t move it would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy buy it you ll like it it will survive a nuclear blast donr be fooled by the imitations should be their slogan there are some real junky ones out there and these are great love the washers life savers thanks any size wuhan china sounds great this little inch model is high pitched but has that trashy wuhan sound i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china my first reaction on opening the box that this came in was gee it s a lot smaller than i expected it looks like a cad equitek e s but it s a fraction of the size i d even say it was cute but how does it perform i have two microphones i use for recording at my computer a blue yeti usb electret mic and a sampson samtr a of the two the yeti is closer in design as it uses an electret capsule and a built in usb interface like the go mic so that s what i compared it to i fired up garage band and plugged both microphones into the computer a four year old imac so i could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks with acoustic guitar ukulele and double bass right off the bat i was impressed with the go mic s lack of latency it was as good as the yeti maybe better there was no perceptible delay no need to find a special driver either plug it in and it s ready to go there s even a headphone jack in the mic something unusual in a package this tiny sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti i tried all three modes carodid carodid bd pad and omni omni gave the best clearest sound not unexpectedly but it was hard to get a good level when close miking no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping using the db pad i was able to get some acceptable levels from a few feet away best sound on all instruments was obtained from feet using the omni mode it has one advantage over the yeti it s very modest in current requirements so i can run it directly off my ipad the two together make a nice portable recording production combination packaging is well thought out too the mic is permanently attached via a swivel to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection and if that s not enough there s a separate case to keep dust and dirt out of the mic while the go mic wouldn t be my first choice for recording music it would be a very acceptable one for recording musical ideas on the go and perfectly acceptable for voice recording podcasting or skyping these pedals are great a friend of mine said i should buy other pedals because these pedals aren t manufactured by a very known brand name but i went with my own judgement and i was not disappointed with them i have increased my speed a lot since i ve gotten em and i can pedal songs like all nightmare long and beast and the harlot now great pedals but it takes time to develop speed so don t think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can t go all jason costa on em i bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my yamaha motif simple and easy set up just plugged it in and it worked fine no complaints it s great to have sustain again on my keyboard again well constructed pedal a nice addition to my recording studio this pedal works with the yamaha motif that was my main concern when ordering no other review stated that so i figured i would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering i hate returning things lol
145	i ve owned a ts since i purchased it used in the s for around yes this is a great overdrive this pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup now you re in tone heaven but the plain truth is this there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the reissue this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives i own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it s not the most transparent or versatile there is a mid hump in the eq of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn t i m glad i own mine but i don t think i d shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue if i am not mistaken both the ts and the ts can be modded to this circuit with less than cents in parts and about minutes of your time if this pedal came in under the mark it would be more deserving of five stars i really hate to burst anyone s bubble but srv s tone was really in his fingers and so is yours i could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor reverb pedal harmonizer ring modulator etc the line m seemed like a good way to have a jack of all trades pedal on my board for those times i needed one specialized effect i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades i have an all analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way almost all of the effects sound great to my ear especially into a tube amp true bypass means no tone suck to boot high points for the delays reverbs and mods i am not a fan of all of the drives but the overdrive and boost comp sound pretty awesome the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat wish i could say the same for the big muff model but i guess they couldn t get them all right the only issue is i liked it so much i could not resist the urge to get the m so i can run three effects simultaneously however if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the m is a winner this is the greatest practice amp ever and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band first it s all tube so it sounds really good it s gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast second it s watts and is pretty darn loud i ve used it for band practice and it s definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer at a bar you ll probably need to mic it or use the included line out third if the speaker isn t loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the x and x cabs i have that ll make it loud enough for most bars fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything you ll need most small tube amps don t have built in effects so if you re trying to practice down in the living room you re forced to drag your effects with you that s annoying with this amp everything is built in fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet you can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone else sixth the price is amazing all tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow fender is basically giving these things away i love this amp so much i want to buy one for every guitarist i know the only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch but considering the price that s understandable there s no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them you ll only want the cover and footswitch if you re playing in a band i was using a joyo power supply and when i bought my fuzz i ran out of plugs so i bought this it does the job i plan on getting a couple of the juniors next since i only have v pedal and the rest are s behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so i was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far so good the mic preamps sound pretty good clean and relatively quiet the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made it also seems to send hotter signal to my jbl eon s and that s a good thing the built in effects are probably its weakest point i ve heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit i also wish that the control room knob and outputs were independent of the main output slider that would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again it would also turn it into a buss mixer so all in all not too shabby for a mixer but i probably wouldn t use it for recording while i don t have a ton of experience with pedals i really love this one keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain although this is a tube overdrive i actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp it is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what i was looking for a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity for the price i don t see how you can beat this pedal i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome no complaints with this outfit more knobs are not always better in the case of this pedal the controls are really sensitive there s a pretty big mid hump that s hard to dial out and the low end control can make things really boomy or add a little chunk to the sound you can do a lot with it but i struggle to find what it does best because it doesn t really do edge of distortion well it doesn t clean up and it s not a really high gain distortion pedal but it can just add a bit of tightness hair metal mids or thump to a standard od sound basically if you have your amp set for s rock you can stomp on this and get motley crue or maybe bark at the moon era ozzy like a tubescreamer this thing lets a little bit of the clean signal through so you hear the distorted guitar mixed with clean signal the circuit design is nothing like a tube screamer but it can work as a substitute i think if you wanted the tube screamer sound thejoyo jf vintage overdrive pedalwould be better just for simplicity sake and being more of a clone so it s not bad but its just not on the level of boutique pedals and their clones if you get tired of it give it to your bass player or try it with a bass for an interesting tone the korg pitchblack is probably along with the boss tu tu considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass both the tu and pitchblack are excellent and i don t really have an opinion yet as to which is better however there are some strengths of the korg pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners the primary draw here is the bright light up display with wide color bars the tuner displays the note you are closest to and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch marked by the green light in the middle almost like an airplane landing guide but not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi tones you could argue therefore that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on off light the tuner works quickly and reliably the build quality is outstanding and it s true bypass when you step on the pedal the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off the switch is also of the soft button variety similar to what you find on some vox pedals and many boutiques it has a nice feel to it though it could be easier to bump if it s in a high traffic area this is a great tuner at a reasonable price it really comes down to user preference but i ve heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility this pedal is beyond loud it s to the point where if you crank this pedal with a watt amp with an speaker you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood to match it up with the clean tone that i get out of my amp i have to set the level in between and just got it so far so good i use delay pretty light n tight slapback vibe not too wet this does it well i considered the mxr delay no i may have considered it but the only pedal failure i ve ever experienced was my mxr dunlop phase first the dc input then the stomp switch after light barely any bedroom use this modtone here seems solidly constructed i haven t played with it too much yet but as of right now i wouldn t recommend it for edge wannabes seems limited in that regard i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes no we do not good tone though does the trick trick i have a squire tele and replaced the tuners with these the tab holes didn t match up they are bigger than the squire originals but it was no problem to set new holes and tighten them up the hold tunings and make string changing a breeze highly recommended true fender product this is a superb tremolo pedal its dials allow for enormous control of the effect it s very sturdy an often noted feature of boss pedals further it s utterly easy to use allows for both v battery and power supply adapter operation and most important of all it delivers beautiful tremolo note it comes with a v battery installed but it does not come with a power source adapter if the price is more than you re willing to pay consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo this also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much sound manipulation as the boss product it s still quite good but the boss takes the prize i paid about for mine and have zero regrets very good string i ve been using elixir strings for about ten years now i ve been a full time musician for about years now and for what i do these sound the best and last for or more month s within these ten years i ve only had strings break on me and i sometimes work days a week for many for at a time i didn t know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps i was origianlly disappointed in the sound
146	virtually eliminates all outside sound allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions nice flat response this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price i used this on my wall mount u rack to hold my modem and router near my switch as an added bonus it has vent holes on the bottom which not only allow for heat dissipation but also make really convenient ziptie tie down locations i ll definitely be buying more of these i have been using them for about months i play about twice a week and they have maintained a good sound over the past months not too difficult to tune either this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal it increases the gain and dirties your tone but it does not actually distort your sound if you re a metal or hard rock player don t buy this it s better suited for country soul r b blues or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when they re doing a solo for that it s excellent especially considering its very low price and despite its very low price it s very solidly built it s like a brick this update is to point out that i ve only used the bad monkey pedal with tube amps a fender blues deville x and a line spider valve hd mk ii running into an ampeg x i have no idea how it ll sound with a solid state amp but it sounds great with a tube amp this update is to point out that i finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good i recently bought a watt fender mustang iii combo to use as a practice amp it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville fender mustang floorboard combination as i ve said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing whether i m playing clean or dirty the bad monkey gives my guitar a rich deep great sounding boost this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is i rarely play directly through any of my amps e g fender hot rod deluxe blues deville super champ x or ampeg b i ll turn down the gain on the bad monkey and use it for a much fatter clean sound it s just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph you ve got to get this pedal these are good heads i have played them on several drum sets and have been pleased with their sound look and feel this is a super solid price too i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc they work well for that the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head after a time the pinch is bit much i have a small hat size too however the price was great and the sound is good i m no audiophile but do play guitar mando and dulcimer and for me these phones deliver a good well rounded sound one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use so if you can deal with the pinch i highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality most ax tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should psychoacoustics being what it is i can t honestly tell you for sure electro harmonix tubes are measurably better than the no name chinese tubes i replace but i think the electro harmonix tubes sound better therefore they do at per shot who cares i suppose i could contrive a double blind experiment to settle the existential question empirically but i d rather spend my time playing rest assured electro harmonix is good stuff and the price is right just do it i got pink cause nobody would steal it and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great
147	this is an inexpensive sturdy sustain pedal that i immediately buy every time i get a new yamaha keyboard this pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano much better than any footswitch only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity it may or may not work properly with non yamaha keyboards another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier better looks and function tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides this is a great microphone for bucks did i just say lol it does not have the same sound as a shure sm but it is kind of close i used it as an overhead microphone on drums recorded an acoustic guitar with it and it worked perfect seen some reviews about hiss from this microphone the hiss is from the cheap xlr into connection who uses that kind of connection anyway would have been great if it included a real xlr but cannot complain after i swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it hiss was gone a no brainer really i have been a producer engineer for over o years this is a great utility microphone if you need an overhead or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp slap it on percussion etc it will work just fine the sound it is quite clean actually for it is a steal if this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio as i can never have enough microphones every microphone has it uses i would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality well constructed pro like product i am a professional musician keyboard player and keyboard collector mostly vintage poly analog but also a ton of mono phonics modulars and built your own kit units shrugging ambik etc not that that has a lot to do with a pedal however i do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that i use to make my living have purchased every brand and style of pedal for the purpose of this we ll stick with sustain compared to other units it is heavier than most and i find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic it is just an on off switch so no half modeling here the only reason i gave this unit stars instead of is because yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps of the market who will get home and if they hadn t thought to check may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed a backward sustain pedal is not fun many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse switch that would eliminate that potential headache these days most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on you may very well cause an issue you don t expect and are confused by turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases so build quality excellent durability excellent i ve had a bunch of cheaper pedals used on stage break at the switch point or at the jack this yamaha endures design some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure i don t see that much anymore but so long as you aren t on glossy hardwood this will stay i place with no issue i ve read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard or something similar all a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit and disengaged when the pedal is released there are no electronics so if it doesn t work there are three points to look at unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all connected to the metal posts inside the housing there are usually two wires of differing color if one is disconnected the pedal will cease to function and in rare instances cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely this is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder jacks are points of strain so it isn t inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged the switches in the yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part would be unlikely to wear out with normal use i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools the third option is the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse this can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity switch if it senses on startup or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether doing nothing at all it is or or a problem with the jack on the keyboard highly unlikely but i ve seen it happen hopefully this helps some who have posted questions to conclude a nice pedal for the money much better build than the m audio decent just not as nice as the yamaha certainly not a bad unit on stage if they can t get most of their mic stands right i don t trust them with even basic electronics or generics does what it should and yamaha quality the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal i am using on a yamaha board
148	my first guitar ever i am happy with it i read great reviews here and the price seemed good it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned and the top part isn t pink like the pic also as others have mentioned it still looks pretty i did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones to minimize finger pain i ordered d addario ej d phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings extra light in a package of three sets and i like those strings better the color is nicer though the originals weren t rusty they looked new others have said their strings were rusty but mine weren t but most importantly it s easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter thinner strings i might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part i am a female and it s already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a man s especially bar chords but for now this is fine i also ordered dava grip tip guitar picks they are nice and i got a kyser string capo in gold and that works well and i got a planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system add on for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck the strap i got was a levy s with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable and i got a planet waves pro winder string winder cutter which came in handy for re stringing and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i haven t tried yet and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg guitar stand and i got a string cleaner by fender so i write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar i ll be using mine to sing with so that s why i needed a capo cause many songs i sing need a capo i use a lot of youtube tutorials to learn how to play and also find tabs chords on ultimate guitar website i can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband a music recording program that comes on mac computers and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful i am very satisfied with my purchase it came in a big rectangular box and inside that box was another one that looked like a coffin haha it made me laugh and inside that was my lovely new guitar i bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well i ve used this to connect several devices and the colors help i would recommend this and the quality is good i am both a bass player and a fidelity freak always fussing over tone settings this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard and even my bass the cd input has no controls but is a very useful feature just the same having behringer mics and a ub mixer i banked on this being a good amp and was not disappointed the band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument no watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings and do not expect instruments to sound perfect together but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds this amp will impress you every musician should have one of these around money well spent not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob there its that this mic for my use is useless it records tooo low cant get enough volume from it far as i can tell good strings they do the job and they feel great not much to say i got exactly what i expected an affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly that s all there really is to say if you need a sturdy guitar case for a les paul styled guitar and don t want to spend a butt load of money look no further i really like these strings good sound and the feel is good not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however i only bought one set not three sets and have not had to change them yet after three months overall dimensions x x very nice travel size sound is about what you would expect it is basically a toy if you use more than of max gain it sounds awful i turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies i am using it with a fender starcaster when i travel for work hotel friendly i think it s over priced but i think it looks good and it seems durable i ve paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didn t sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out so if you re looking for a quality guitar at a price that s more than fair there simply isn t a better deal around i didn t know what to expect given the price but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction for example the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed they work smoothly and firmly hold the strings in tune the instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box the action didn t seem inordinately high but i couldn t resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so and now the guitar plays even better i might tinker some more at some point probably when it comes time to replace the strings but for now i am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full bodied dreadnought which is rich and resonant and very impressive i still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price but the proof is indisputably before me this tuner is easy to use i have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn t seem to be perfect on pitch this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase it didnt hold as many i as thought it only holds but that didnt matter now i finaly have some where to put my picks so i dont lose them the pick holder also has a sticky thing at the bottom so you can stick it to your guitar or somthing
149	singing and playing menas you dont get to bend down and pick up that pick you just dropped i loved this holder its small enough to fit in your pocket and when you go on stage just throw it on the mic stand loved it but i forgot it at a gig thats the down side of it being so small easy to lose but it is awesome came on time work great for my needs geart for set ups and take downs does lengthen the strap a bit but works this is nearly identical to theguardian cases cg b bass guitar caseat about half the cost however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations first the issues while the covering appears to be stitched on it is for the most part glued on and if the case is left in a hot unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges on the other hand someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car or garage or other storage space for prolonged periods however you should be aware of the issue if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers imagine the effect on your bass the limitations are simple the case while a hard shell design is not as strong as one made from abs plastic the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides this is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs but if you have a heavy road schedule and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band s gear this case will not afford you the protection of an ata style case also note that i have only used this case for a fender jazz bass so any long scale j or p style basses will fit i cannot be sure about other brands and models i mentioned an ata style case as a better solution and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules for less demanding protection i recommend that you also consider this case which i purchased as an upgrade when i became aware of the issues and limitations of the musician s gear model skb electric bass rectangular hardshell standard latches handle if you still opt for the musician s gear case you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag i ve been playing guitar for years and personally i would prefer cleartone or elixir strings i bought these for my little sister and she loves them they have a really nice sound to them i feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these the lil suckers are all about tuning stability those other style string guides just aren t the same because the string binds too much gave them stars because i don t like the little nibs in the underside i filed them off
150	these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most as far as i can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all they stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time if you have a double bass kick pedal i highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy the top part spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again the padding is comfortable but slightly heavy velcro flaps make installation easy the only thing i do not like is that it is prone to slide around on my nylon strap i will probably use double sided tape to attach it to the strap i feel they should ave designed the inner flap with something less slippery it s great if you need to quickly drop your hats but not the other way around i bought this drop clutch because it was cheap and i was on a budget overall its build is solid the only problem i have with it is having the clutch lock back into place good product great price works well so far bought for the price of one of the others free ship one for the road one for pratice wow haha this china really packs a punch haha i got this china and was blown away by it my band loves it the crowds love it and most importantly it is very loud and trashy great for hardcore drummers incredible quality and value these cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than i expected for the price they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end the dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables and the color coding is a big plus as well not only is the product outstanding but i was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure i was happy with the cable set i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life

152	very good strap fine quality your guitar will be fixed surely just one thing that strap is too big for kids so if you choose some kind of mini guitar than you d better to find something else else this is a really good choise i only recently started playing the guitar and as a beginner i wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitar this one came at a great price and it s sturdy enough for me so i think this is very decent strap for the price i paid for it it s quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily i was very impressed by this little guitar the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless the only complaints i have is e string breaks often which is a direct result of constant tuning fatiguing the strings i feel the tuners are just not strong enough and the ratio is no adequate to keep in tune still a great guitar for a to year old have been using these for years on my acoustic guitar like them and never an issue nice bright tone and last a good long while i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture it is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last over the years i ve literally owned dozens of electronic tuners generally five or six at a time in various locations ranging from a musiciansfriend promotional item to a rack mount most have been in the range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko the seiko sat e is my all time favorite because like mama bear in the fairy tale it affordably splits the difference between too small and too big it stays put on the floor when i run it inline between my guitar bass uke and my amp and its lcd display is large enough to be legible when i m standing at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare bravo this will work with my daughter s ipod touch generation however the garage band app is for ios and hers is an ios and will not update to so though she can t use garage band there are others that are supposed to work she downloaded the ampkit app and it works great with her ipod and the apogee jam here is a list of other apps that are supposed to work with the apogee jam ampkitamplitube version or greater amps cabsanytuneapple

version or greater voice memosxewton music studio it s a pretty cool idea but the cords are a nuisance most electric guitar players like to stand while playing and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections i was surprised at how small the jam is slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around and it saves on other s ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings especially if you are beginner guitarist overall pretty good and very simple to operate just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice my daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do i ve been playing over years and got one of these for my year old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does for it s an ok starter guitar for a kid and i guess really short people who can t play a regular fender but not something i d recommend to anyone else and my kid thinks it looks cool so he ll be more likely to stick with it even though it has a laminated body the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood the frets are crowned ok but have some sharp ends to them and i feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed it s light and easy to handle the hardware isn t bad with a stable bridge good idea not to put a floating trem in this way blade switch solid jack and strap anchors and smooth knobs the pickups are not top notch but work well enough a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does so i m not complaining it has a nice red paint job on the down side besides some sharp fret ends it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be the fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret the nut on the one i got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side so the low e string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings it has one small pit in the red finish it has no paperwork or owner s manual the tuners are kind of choppy and the body neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune it comes strung with fender s which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down so it s good for a kid just starting out i actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound but as soon as he gets bigger we ll ditch this for something better i bought this to work with my year old son this will do many cool things although i am not ready to turn him loose with it yet i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software i have been using audacity which is a free download i would pay the price again in a hartbeat these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips they are very light to play and make my practising easier whille iconcentrate on building callouses
153	i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up they are indeed some high tech strings with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability plus they feel and sound good so grab a pack and get jamming you ll definitely want to check these out have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have wish they had something for acoustic electric backplug i wanted a string but did not want to spend a lot of money this guitar fits the bill the finish is much darker then the pictures online show great sound from this bad boy this is a big guitar once i figured out how to tune the string it really does not go out of tune after i few hours of play i retune it and its marginally out of tune i thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality while they are not grover tuners they get it done the downside for me is not the guitar s fault this is an inexpensive guitar and a fantastic entry into string playing this guitar is hard to play below the th fret as there is no cut away but that is true of all guitars using this body type now that i have had it awhile i would love for it to be acoustic electric but again for the price i was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action im keeping it i knew i did right by buying the dr it s great and stands up to much more expensive of it s kind i have lots of gibsons as well as epiphones and frankly i don t see any difference to speak of if anybody wants a durable acoustic string with fine sound you ll find it in the dr best of luck to allregards roger epiphone dr acoustic guitar string natural first off let s get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the dr on the epiphone web site length bout length lower bout thickness lower bout width so now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it the only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the length most bags are you can always opt for the epiphone hard case edread or world tour rwg d or gba the bag i got now that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the review as my title says the guitar reminds me of my samick st which is a very well made spruce top acoustic which is also made in indonesia i have played guitar for over years so i have a collection of over guitars and of them are acoustics but this is the first string and i bought it just to have it around for songs like hotel california etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar i would rarely use i am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under asking price it tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out you constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure the bridge plate on these strings must be huge i found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you don t hit the large one right next to it i have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which i like the nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of that the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out i have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one i have is the later very playable right out of the box and very beautiful i have a epiphone swingster nighthawk and violin bass and they are all great products i decided to give it a good set up after the strings were off i sanded down the bridge mm and adjusted the neck just a little then i want to really recommend martin bronze strings light or extra light green box for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on strings instructional videos can be viewed on youtube before you go for it or you get a guitar tech to do it ps matching epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an amp or line in recording ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner not the same as a mxr so don t get your hopes up on that it is however a great compressor for the money and useful for many applications i find myself using it for bass more than guitar but its great for either
154	it does a fantastic job i ve had it for almost a year now still works as well as the first day perfect condition this is a star stand considering the price sure it s not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what it s supposed to do without any problems i don t forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough it s a music stand so i don t see how it would take a lot of abuse have had one for years has survived many gigs and rehearsals and many months in the trunk of my car harsh environment purchased for hanging two rock band pseudo guitars works great for that and for uke would also be ok with guitars the nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar like instrument within reason the packaging is very basic you just get the product with no fasteners or instructions the hanger looks good is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments when solidly mounted the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments though i did not test that for the cost these are a smoking deal the alternatives i purchased for my music room heavy bass guitars cost about x more and are not necessarily any better functionally as mentioned there is no included hardware but that is a non issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall board fasteners depending on your situation and weight of your instrument so just plan on visiting the hardware store if you don t already have these in your shop i used wall board hangers for one direct screws into joist for the other as it happens easy to install holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat and keeps it off of the floor away from the animals when i have it out of the case great find well worth the purchase price i love these picks especially in this gauge they are a bit thinner than the jazz s so if you master em you can in theory play faster they have a good grip and a nice texture the tone it gives isn t bad either i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele it s attractive it s well made it s fork is a tad large for the ukulele it has rubber o rings that slide so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then but then even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase or wall if you use it there the uke hits when i put it in the hanger so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners this is much less expensive holds very well is even more low profile than this hanger and never drops a uke consider it for your needs i d not buy another of these for a ukulele it likely works fine for a guitar though i deducted one point for the fact that even though it s adjustable the o rings and advertised for ukes it doesn t work well for them and it s heavy and not stylish in my opinion i have the hercules wall hanger mechanical gripper for my electric guitars and it s fabulous for guitars overkill for lightweight ukuleles maybe hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp wbupdate the more i use it the less i like it i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune so for small instruments you d have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos this is atrocious for guitars it s not as good as hercules easy to mount solid grip on guitar only detractor would be that with my guitar at least it hangs kind of far from the wall this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though an acoustic would clear the wall nicely my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar without marring even soft wood i very much prefer this to having it on one of the accident waiting to happen stands on the floor very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue adhesive during installation you want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar cables are cables they usually all work and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good i love these things they hold your guitars in place and make this storage solution a nice decoration in the process this a very clever idea it helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space very easy to take off put on high recommend this to any stringed instrument players this is quality construction it s definitely a must i m a taller guy and it s important to have proper posture for longer playing periods i m glad i bought this it can hold the weight of any of my guitars its easy to install and i guess its cheap it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter this strap is very well made the leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar very happy with this low cost strap
155	solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place arrived a day erly this tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding but it is not very good at parties it cannot compete with the noise level that people in conversation can make it is cheap so you should just get one i am having great fun experimenting around with different settings instruments and power feed voltage levels see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool i was surprised of how well this stand is made it s worth easily i ve used stands for over years and this is the best i ve owned i have a rose gold plated flute and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating this does the job perfectly wipes off fingerprints smudges easily and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate is easy on the plating and very gentle washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries am very pleased this is a pretty good stand for the price i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms i have the dr pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is bt for the price this is a good value i have of these stands for my guitars i have classical guitars flamenco guitars and acoustic steel string it s very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over it s a really great quality stand for the price they don t take up a lot of room and they re very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you re traveling i highly recommend it my guitar teacher suggested that i keep my guitar s out because he said that if i kept it them in a visible easily accesible place that i would practice more even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags cases after each practice session i have them all out and displayed and i definitely practice and play more because as soon as i step into the room there they are i just pick any one of them up and start playing it was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but i hadn t realized that i always had the excuse that i didn t have time to practice but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn t take up a lot of time for some reason kept me from practicing i guess out of sight out of mind but now i keep my guitars out and i also bought a music stand and i keep the music i m working on and the stand out yes it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful works as described solid little wires that allow you to be creative in how you hook up your guitar pedals may work other applications that require the same type of plug i really like this cable it is a great quality cord that is very durable and i think it would be a long time before i would need another one the length is long enough for any need and the cable will obviously be around for a while i purchased this model for home use not for a kid s backpack it s solid and sturdy easily holding a song book open not just a few pieces of sheet music it adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening i often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down works for me if you are considering this guitar i have to assume you re shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end not trying to decide between this and a gibson les paul custom it is in the category of beginner intermediate guitars that i rate this a star instrument i really couldn t find anything wrong with it yes it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive epiphone les pauls such as having only two controls for volume and tone rather than four which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous gibson but you weren t planning to try to fool anyone were you beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway the sound is good and i found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine the pickups are surprisingly good the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls it was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good although it would sure be nice if they didn t cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality as for fit and finish reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a monday after a long weekend of partying for several reasons if i had this to do over i would not buy it online nor would i buy it from gc better to inspect the actual guitar you ll be buying and don t be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don t like the first one you see i discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price but they would have included a full professional setup including string change you are likely to find a similar deal where you live because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the internet and gc as it is i took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup it had some intonation problem the action was too high and as others have commented the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately i asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners as i d read a lot of people trashing the tuners bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them he instead assured me that they were fairly decent and advised against changing them unless a problem develops out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase however now that it s been fully set up and new strings installed i am quite pleased with this guitar i don t believe you will find a better guitar or even close at this price level i did a lot of shopping and considered guitars up to for my first foray into electric i was tempted to go with something more expensive on the theory that in a couple years i ll want to upgrade anyway now i m glad i chose this one for one thing this is a guitar i ll always enjoy having around there is nothing cheap or toy like about it in years my tastes may change i may want something completely different down the road and now i still have that option had i gone with a more expensive model i d feel locked in no good bottom line if you re shopping for a guitar in this price range i think you ll be pleased with this guitar buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you re buying and negotiate to have a setup included because it will almost certainly need one have it set up right install some quality strings and you ll be very happy with the epiphone lp special ii i gave it five stars i purchased this for my young son but i find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does i wanted something flexible and decided to buy the mustang iii over the ii because of the power and the larger speaker i ve read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what i think about the amp it sounds great and it has loads of power since it s solid state it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end but for this price wow i have no complaints one thing most have failed to mention is the non amp features like the input for an mp player and the fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes both mac and windows are supported my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively since he s he doesn t have many opportunities to play with others he can create jam click tracks and play along we also downloaded new firmware from fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions people who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks then upload them to fender s user web site we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired he wanted a tone that sounded like his we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people one of them was particularly great we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it he loves it great amp i can t compare to line but i can compare it to other amps i ve heard it s pretty nice equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of on fx this arrived a week sooner then expected i am very happy with this bag my fender lh san miguel acoustic guitar fits perfectly it is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry on stage makes decent products but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times that would have been perfect otherwise it works fine this is a great music stand very solid feel no need to over tighten the adjusters it holds my heaviest books without tipping over i was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate if not be indistinguishable from the audio quality of the heavy duty shure microphones used at wgtd fm hd all the mics that i had previously tried at this price point and lower including blue s snow line sounded overly treblish with pronounced sibilance listen to the comparison contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration by contrast the yeti is rich and resonant and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter short of spending times more i m convinced this is the best option in my particular case at the same time as a musician without a home studio i seriously doubt i ll make much use of the mic for performance or recording as far as performance goes the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation upstaging the performer at least a vocalist with a normal sized head and for traveling purposes i ve found the sansom go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer even though blue s literature shows the yeti alongside a laptop blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of blue s lighter more compact microphones its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility but as other reviewers have mentioned the volume gain and pattern knobs are rather loose allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement the knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment there s the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control s circular movement but it s not at the o clock position so it s difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid point for quick and easy assessment of positioning in sum the yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably priced mics and it should prove a useful not to mention handsome addition to any home studio it s still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior it s main competitor on amazon the audio technica at is pint sized compared to the yeti and i ll confess i m still not sure whether i made the best choice the mics have been alternating in the and slots of best selling mics on amazon for months now i wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the at s relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise however slight to audio quality i experienced initial hesitancy on yeti s part to make an appearance in the input and output panels in system preferences of my imac then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action my hunch is that a good powered port hub would be equally effective i love the fit and the sound quality it doesn t come loose or wiggle once in place i ll get this one again very pleased with this item it really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
156	crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy packs of these hunks of crap for under bucks i should have spent the extra bucks and got the pack of ernies i didn t even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right never again these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my lp good sustain and strings are staying in tune well but unless you are new to guitar you know that these strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer really i can t tell that they do or that they don t they sound great and play great and i usually purchase d addario or martin strings not sure if i would pay more for these in future i play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way change the strings every couple of months just me at home so no big deal if i were performing i would go through them faster i m giving stars because d addario makes great strings nuff said these strings are okay but nothing special except for the price which is a factor when changing twice a week i don t play enough to need changes that often anymore so i ve become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar this doesn t mean that these strings are bad it just means i might prefer brand x pure nickel on one guitar because they re darker and brand y steels on another because they re brighter and brand z on yet another so give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least if you want your instrument in top shape a bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good i started experimenting on strings i say why wouldn t i try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced i m hooked to bronze strings thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings great all round pick one of my favorites easy to grip and are pretty quite they wear out extremely fast though so far this cable has worked very well it has had no issues at all for the money you cannot even make your own i ve been using these strings for years tried a bunch of others as well but these suckers keep coming out on top probably will never stop buying them at about twice the price of their standard strings these d addario nyxl strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability higher breaking point and something called fusion twist which i swear is a rare chubby checker b side having just put a set of these on one of my guitars i can t speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings but i can say they are solid dependable strings with lots of punch and crunch i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics it was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do highly recommended i m never playing another guitar without these locks after my custom telecaster fell the neck went out of wack i had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again that s every musician s nightmare i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps schaller kept coming up i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use one issue you may run into is the nut running loose that s not a problem with the scaller locks it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily i bought these strings to try on my guitars they sound good on a variety of models like sg les paul rickenbacker they have a melodic tone and good intonation and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape use it with an sm shure mic in a studio type application holds up great mic does not slip upside down sideways purchased this korg guitar and bass tuner for our son who uses it to tune his acoustic and electric guitar he says its easy to use and is durable it has led lights to follow as well as a meter to use excellent product highly recommend never used this seller or site for this purpose before sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks they fit perfectly and i have used them on strat and a levinson blade not forgeting my ibenez easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service this seller is worth supporting thanks pretty simple tool did exactly what i needed it to for a decent price i d order again if i needed another one i ve purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store mainly due to the low cost they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune the guitars have to be re tuned often when temperature humidity or playing more than ten minutes occurs my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string then the strings go flat sounding these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality they are okay for someone that doesn t play often but if you play daily or as a performer avoid these strings better strings are worth the extra cost you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings i ve had this problem with all the d addario brand strings both for electric or acoustic or string guitars the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing the tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster i should ve just got this cable the first time i have been using monster for years i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way i swear by these strings these are the only strings i will use on my les paul their bright tone sounds great and full while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze don t buy these strings just because i like them buy them because they suit you because you like the tone they provide because they feel good against your fingers cons what cons try them excellent guitar strings they last a long time sound great and are pretty cheap these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently for the more casual player these might not be the best choice for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these d addario strings they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings for the more casual musician somebody that isn t changing their strings once a week these are probably not a great choice personally i use elixir strings on my electric guitars a les paul standard and a gibson lucille i do not play gigs so a set of strings doesn t see an hour or two of really hard playing per night the coating on elixir s helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers i like their feel a bit better than these strings i get about a month of playing from those strings sadly these d addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing i ve tried a variety of strings ernie ball elixir and d addario on my guitars and the way i play the elixir s just sound and play the best to me of course your mileage may vary if i did start to play gigs i would probably switch to a more affordable string like these a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings d addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge i change strings myself and i really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings with the gauge clearly printed on the package if you are new to changing strings or only change them infrequently this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time d addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic i kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started they could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary in the end the silly colored balls at the end of the strings well they look goofy on my guitars i wouldn t mind the colors on an acoustic the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway but those balls are visible on my electric guitar i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar they last and they stay in tune sound very good too the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years i read all of the reviews and bought pairs of these based on the reviews so i put these on my gibson les paul last night and played for a few hours i didn t hammer the strings just played easy mostly the eagles as i was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward i took a quick look at the strings i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing the strings sounded great but by the time i had them stretched enough that they would hold tune they were already worn i guess i m going to have to go to heavier strings so i m not changing strings every few days these just did not perform as expected giving these stars is being generous i have sets to use up now damn i was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up but they lasted for only two hours my fender l bullets at least lasted a few weeks going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound i m still in search of the perfect set of strings i m open to suggestions i ve tried pretty much every harp out there after having played the regional blues jazz circuit for about years lee oskar harps are the best value on top of it lee oskar actually called me once just because i left a question on his website i ve met rick epping of hohner harmonicas at namm great guy but he never called me at in the afternoon just because i could not identify a song i thought he was playing on i carry around between or harps to a gig so that is at least for a set of lee oksar harps suzuki manji harps while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great would cost nearly presuming you could find them i will not say i ve never blown a reed on a lo but i will say that for a new set of lo reed plates beats for a new manji at least in my book on top of it all they really did with the manji is discontinue the bushman delta frost harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price lee oskar harmonicas are inexpensive they are simple and cheap to repair easy to play have great tone and are even easy to identify since the st nd position keys are printed right on the comb that feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet give them a shot i use it to wind my strings i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast very easy to use does everything you d expect it to do as well as a couple of things you might not like first when run before the amp it adds a bit of treble to the tone and a hint of distortion not to the point of being unusable but you guys playing with the fender clean tone might notice i certainly did playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine ive noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop the treble boost distortion isnt there or at least not noticeable in my experience of course ymmv those are minor complaints though as the pedal works well has more than adequate delay times up to ms and is built well i strongly suggest using this with a v adapter because this pedal will eat a v battery in a matter of minutes overall its a great deal no its not as pristine a delay as a carbon copy or boss dd but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals and i doubt anyone but you will notice the difference i m just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best i like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound the price is right not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings they are the equivalent ofernie ball slinkys yellow they play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble non touring musician s opinion also it s nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer as a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the eb sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or dr sets that come two to a sleeve in summary if you re searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren t reading this review you re out experimenting for others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more i can put electric guitars in gig bags on this stand it is solid and no problems with itafter months use assembly was pretty easy and took little time these aren t usually my go to strings but d addarios are a good solid sounding string they last fairly long when taken care of and don t usually break too often i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing they will continue to be my nd string of choice as they ve not failed me any time i ve purchased them definitely recommended these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar i would rather concentrate on making music why fight your guitar the gauges are identical to ernie ball regulars yellow label but the d addario s string tension feels stiffer which is nice for slide playing i like my action medium low comfortable for straight playing and bending solid intonation for chords yet not too much fret rattle for slide i usually stretch the heck out of ernie ball s after putting them on because they have so much spring in them i deliberately left the d addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all their new sound is quite bright as advertised but has far less of what i call new string jangle which is fine by me as a kid i d sweat that off in an hour but these days playing a number of instruments it can last awhile there s a string tension chart handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number i ll admit i d never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting but apparently that s the case and d addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set if you do come across fakes if you re willing to report it they ll provide you with a genuine replacement for free i ve used d addario phosphor bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over years and swear by their quality and consistency i ve used ernie ball s on electrics for even longer habits can be tough to break but as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots i find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings finally nailing a sound and feel you ve been chasing after for years makes it all worth it i picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit it does a wonderful job of that drive set low and the level set high tone set to taste the additional noise it produces is relatively low so you won t have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with as with any other boss pedals it s well made and reliable this strap is value for money i was surprised when i got it i didn t expect something so good at this price the material is shiny blue and doesn t look cheap and the strap is generously wide the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo goes well with my black squier strat highly recommended sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a tusq this should improve my sustain and tone even more if you re looking for a budget increase of tone this is a way to go these strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume amplified than regular nickel steel strings cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life i recently ordered the new m steels from ernie ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more cobalt for even better output i use p single coils on my godin lg and these strings sound great they have a nice feel to them and i can bend the heck out of them no breaking no problems with slipping and tuning i m hoping the m steels will be even better but if not these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that i was using which were ernie ball s regular slinky s made from nickel i love the design and the strap holds up very well i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol i have a set of the original locking tuners on a ish strat so i decided to try these on a fender telecoustic guitar i have that wouldn t stay in tune these fixed that problem it stays in perfect tune now these are the best strings i ve ever put on my guitar i play a really nice morgan monroe creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves the bright highs the rich mids and they bend like crazy when i need them too i have been purchasing these strings for over years now only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars i m pretty impressed with it i ve only used plug in types of tuners prior and this was a nice surprise i ran this through my ukulele electric guitars as well as an electric bass i was blown away how it could tune my bass it works quickly and it seems pretty accurate compared to my petersen i would recommend it to anyone took one star off for visibility certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily i ve been playing for nearly ten years and i ve used all sorts of strings on many different guitars i ve had ball ends pop off for no reason ball ends rolling around in the bottoms of containers when i ve bought them new and a lot of unnecessary string breakage and fast corrosion all top brands i have also overpaid for fancy gimmicks on strings that are supposed give you magic tones ect then i tried d addario they just work and work well i m not asking for anything magical i just need what i need when i need it and these string have never failed to deliver i ve been using them for over three years now i don t know why i didn t give them a shot sooner i could have saved a lot of money trying them first bottom line is these strings do the job without any drama giving me more time to just play these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break one of my favorite strings for my les paul i tend to go with ernie ball super slinky s on my strat but these would probably sound nice on a strat as well made of quality material i do not need anything fancy because i am a simle person it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar this is my second order of the pack a local store wants for one set of these the feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands i ve tried including and especially the most commonly used eb s i have however had a slight issue with certain d strings on occasion it looks as if the winding is chipping off but not at the frets i change strings quite often so it really doesn t matter not sure what that s about but it doesn t affect anything and like i said this is my second order of these so i gave them stars any less and i d look dumb i ve been playing the guitar since the s so i ve gone through plenty of guitar stands always found the hanging type to be the safest most secure for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand when i first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church i attend christ community church st charles il i decided to give them a look the build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar electric or acoustic are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching denting it offers a very solid support and i feel safe putting my guitar on it this is the only type of stand i prefer to use i do wish it wasn t made in china too much of our money goes to that country just my opinion the bottom line is that i am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats these look great and work perfectly i didn t give stars just because i know there are better strings out there but these strings are a great value and wouldn t hesitate to buy them again in fact i have already bought them several times one little thing i appreciate about these strings is the different colored ends that makes them easy to identify although this is hardly a high end microphone it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument although the output signal seems like it could be stronger the stand is sturdy too so this is probably not the best choice for the full time professional musician but for busking around or playing in clubs it s worth a look the d addario sets are good stuff i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker the color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran with stretching they stay in tune fine the unknown truth about non nylon strings and maybe even them too is that there are only a handful of string makers and d addario actually makes them for other companies gore uses them for their elixir series and just adds the polyweb coating i also use the ghs standard sets and they are good too my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale i don t remember who makes what strings for what companies though with offshore production a standard thing now it s no telling where they actually come from anyways i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it the specs seemed as if it would support my very heavy very expensive hand made x cabinet and matching head it seemed the only design that would allow me to tilt back the pair and it absolutely delivered the upright support in the back extends quite a bit and the protective foam is moveable and can be positioned at just the right location i am truly impressed and after using this weekend after weekend with a gigging band can soundly recommend this product it s a cheap speaker stand heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke overall though it ll do the job i would not use this at the highest height setting but one or two notches lower else it starts leaning these strings aren t for everyone and probably not what you want for everyday normal playing but if you re looking for a fast playing string with a bright sound this is the string in addition to putting them on my guitar i also have a six string banjo guitar tuning and just couldn t get the sound i wanted from regular guitar strings light guage nickel strings were recommended to me and they were exactly what i was looking for they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming i play a lot of bluegrass and irish music and i feel these strings are ideal for that purpose i use a lot of d addario strings on my various instruments and i think they offer the most bang for the buck in terms of quality and tone you can pay more but i don t think you get that much more although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars d addario are the best strings that i have tried i used to use ernie ball super slinky s but found that these last longer the ernie s bend and play well but they tend to go dull faster not to mention the ernie s start corroding within a week these d addario strings stay brighter longer i usually change them about every weeks the ernie s only last me a week weeks at the most that can get expensive fast all around the d addario strings are the strings me retraction when i originally wrote this review i thought they were the best turns out they are in fact way better than ernie ball strings but they are no longer my preference a friend of mine told me about dr strings and they are much better than these d addarios dr s last three times as long as d addario the dr s cost a lil more but they are way better for the money addarios are good but i would recommend spending a few dollars more for dr strings they are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them i had earnie ball on previously and i might switch back or go to dunlop witch i put on my sting and love but i probably won t get these again ever to be clear i am quite the newbie guitar player after i managed to break a string on my electric guitar i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself as most guitarists do things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke i just figured it was something i did and wasn t the products fault so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine overall i ve played quite abit with these strings and have yet to break another one pretty good sound quality and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture resistant package to prevent corrosion all tuners like this are going to be a little jumpy none of them are perfect this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it the korg pitchblack was a little out of my price range so the ga is working perfect for now overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand five stars d addario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for other than that i like this brand of strings i ve almost exclusively used earnie balls and d addarios since i was a kid and have always been satisfied i ve taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately the d addarios are excellent strings and this price on the pack was unbeaten anywhere as stated in the title this adapter is what you need if you use your danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries you can now plug it into the wall as advertised it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so i ve owned it the reason i took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn t seem too durable so because of this i have been very careful so it doesn t get broken you might be able to find an off brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the honeytone so you won t risk ruining it i play using this device it is portable so i always have it with me i tune the a to and this works well for that has a tuner and a metronome what s not to love best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar unless you are in a quiet area it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings this is a good thing it s sensitive planet waves has built its company making affordably priced accessories and these patch cables are no exception i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price the thickness and connectors seems to hold up well although i may look for a slimmer alternative soon as some other reviewers have stated also that the connector ends are a bit large and could become difficult to work with in smaller or crowded pedalboards there are two ways guitar strings go bad if you leave them on long enough the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode but that takes months if not more before that happens grease from your fingers dust bits of skin and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings between the windings this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound back when strings were a lot more expensive some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them some bass players still do coated strings are a simpler alternative these strings and similar ones like elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings which accomplishes two things first it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap which prevents rust and corrosion second it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings they do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings but it s not a huge difference and after a month or two they still sound the same they also cost about twice as much as equivalent non coated d addarios are they worth it that depends if you re an active performer maybe you re probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you re getting a bright sound you re probably also buying your strings by the box there s no real benefit to these strings where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy these days i m strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year i have four acoustic guitars and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played with coated strings i can leave a set on a guitar and a month or two later i can pull it out of the case and it s ready to play i still change strings if i m going to be playing in public but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house these are great i ve been using these straplocks for over years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot folks this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it s not going anywhere this is a must have just buy it i know spending this kind of money on a pedal that doesn t even add an effect to your tone sounds pretty crazy but this is definitely worth it if you think about it when your guitar is out of tune it doesn t matter how perfect every aspect of your playing equipment and set up is you will still sound bad so in a way this is the most important pedal you can have this pedal works great as a tuner and very vividly displays how far off you are from being in tune works great as a mute switch too just one click and you ve got no sound perfect for switching guitars and or just muting all sound the design is quite sturdy as well it feels very solid i definitely recommend this pedal i have been playing guitar for three decades and it seems to me that d addario has been around i use light strings when i want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner probably because i used them in this manner it is great that amazon stocks these making ordering convenient these come in a stay fresh vacuum pack so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent daddy s never let you down i like their longevity too i don t switch til one cuts so they last as cheap as i actually am fits very well on my les paul i own several small tuners including the enote nano tuner and the snark in comparison to those i would say its most like the enote when it comes to size but definitely more accurate and responsive in comparison to the snark its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the snark anyway it all comes down to preference i suppose i would recommend it compared these all in medium s on a taylor dreadnought martin sp bronze phosphor bronze martins lifespan sp dr d addario ej phosphor bronze and elixir nanoweb bronze and phospher bronze i tried them back to back switching back and forth narrowing it down to d addario and elixirs i did the same with these sets one day i d try all playing along with a cd then i d try a different set every days the elixir comes out on top best sounding of all smooth on my fingers second elixir phospher bronze last was d addario i d be satisfied with the d addario they do sound good but the elixir sounds feels better hard to day too much but it works great no issues to speak of it does the job perfectly well i have been a faithful user of d addario strings since a well meaning obsession starter recommended them to me at a local music store compared to other brands of nickel strings that i ve used these ones just feel cleaner than the others they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most if you re looking for acoustic strings you can t beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity but if you re looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean look no further it is simple accurate takes up very little room and has several modes that are nicely backlight to top it all off it s about half the price of any other pedal tuner korg king of the practical tuner world polishes well you could probably buy a microfiber cloth from somewhere else and it would do the same thing but this one works well i bought these to beef up the bottom end of a telecaster that came from the factory with a set of fender s that topped out at on the low e which is just too small for good twangy bass i ve been using them for a few months now and haven t broken one even though i can bend the high e to touch the d string i use d addarios on my other guitars but tried these ernie balls just for the hybrid mix and there isn t a whole lot of difference d addario sells a similar set called exl so maybe i ll try those next but for now these are good for connecting pedals in tandem got two of these three packs been using them for quite some time and not one has failed yet nice value as well i do like these strings had a few packs of these from christmas opened up one recently and the string or st string was not in there next time i m gonna have to open up the package to make sure they re all in there should measure them too didn t open them to keep them sealed until i was ready to use them no more at first i thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous but after actually trying one i love it it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow i can honestly say this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out not to mention that it s hard to strum and sounds awful what these picks are good for is leads rock metal shredding and even country the sound is short with a very high tone pitch switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull one plus is while recording i do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking shredding as i did with a plastic pick i still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound but love these picks when things heat up also i d like to add that even though i can play rock you like a hurricane by the scorpions it never sounds quite right until now using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound also these picks have a no slip grip with the fender facing your fingers there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it s very easy to grip and use it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick i can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience you get a speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around this is by far the best practice amp i have found in the past years and i owna butt load of new amps i have actually upgraded to a champion but still use this amp as much as the don t even think about it this is one of the best under practice amps unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp and in that case you should look elsewhere as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time as an addendum i would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras i have read from other reviewers i have a few of these amps so just for the heck of it i put in a celestion g greenback which costs more than the r and was very disappointed withthe results this amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now but can still be had new for under if you just do an internet search i have several of these straps in different colors and i ve never been disappointed it holds my pound les paul with no problems and the first one i bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong if you like the design go for it this mic is good considering the price does it sound exactly like a no do it have a decent quality sound absolutely if you re expecting an sm then buy an sm if you want something close on a budget this is your mic great value and good sound i don t use these alot but when i play jazz style music or ballads they work better without playing with heavy attack and give a more mellow tone to the solo s i ve been hooked on d addarios for quite a while the per unit price on these is great and i never worry about breaking one of these fender picks are some of the best picks money can buy i have used these picks for years now and i just love them i have seen people complain about battery life i turn it on tune and then turn it off and my batteries last forever the display is good and the tuners work well i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity i think it is a well made product and good value thank god for tuners there is nothing worse than a bunch of out of tune loud guitar players great picks not just for jazz though i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel but once you do they are fantastic i ve owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw the pots all still work without adding noise and in general the device does exactly what i need it to do you won t find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp mixer this is the one pedal i can t do without you can sculpt your guitar tone before it hits your amp and that s the key to getting a tight rhythm tone at high gain so if i encounter an amp that isn t tight enough or the high gain distortion doesn t sound good by itself i just turn down the gain or use a lower gain channel and then hit it hard with this pedal sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion alright so here are some things you might want to know before you buy the gain knob when turned to zero still produces overdrive so you can t use this as a clean boost pedal with high output humbuckers you still get some mild tube like overdrive at zero gain but this isn t advertised as a clean boost pedal so how much gain distortion does this pedal have if you re going into a clean channel of an amp plenty for classic rock and blues not enough for metal though if you crank the gain and high knob all the way you can just barely get a prog style metal tone but it s not a distortion pedal it s just an overdrive this thing uses tiny smc components in the circuitry and therefore isn t really moddable unlike the bad monkey this doesn t have an additional mixer cabinet emulated output like a tube screamer it boosts the mids and reduces the bass so that going into a mushy sounding tube channel you get a tighter distorted sound anyone who has a nice warm amp and gets this pedal thinking they ll get more of the same may be disappointed what they need instead is a transparent clean boost pedal that keeps their guitar the same tone just louder volume the classic modified switch is pretty cool i have two guitars one is kind of bassy and scooped sounding the other is bright and middy well using the switch i can make one come out more equivalent to the other when needed this keeps me from adjusting my amp each time i switch guitars classic is a slightly lower gain more mid boosted sound quite tight think peavey eq structure modified is more scooped saturated think mesa eq structure so this switch is a useful little bonus it eats batteries sucking in around ma at v so my mah rechargeable lasts hrs i swear if that blue led weren t so bright it would probably get an extra hour instead of getting an adapter i got an battery aa clip v battery clip v dc plug and sanyo eneloop batteries hooked it up with negative tip positive sleeve and now i have a mah monster about hours play time this pedal is perfect you get what it s advertised to do it s rugged looks good i haven t found it to be noisy at all unless there was something wrong with my guitar strings not grounded through the bridge etc someone mentioned the silver tops of the dials falling off as if they were decals but i looked and the knobs seem like all one solid piece to me another thing i found is that instead of using an overdrive plugin in my daw if i use this real overdrive pedal in front of my interface that magically makes all hum noise from my pickups go away overall yes i highly recommend this and would suggest people check out the hardwire metal distortion if they want something as a standalone rather than an overdrive into a crunchy amp like others though i can t stop playing through this great purchase especially if bought used i don t know if from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body i know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adult however for its on sale at the time even if its not i can still learn to play since thats why i bought it is to learn the pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn t really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine all togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good i am happy with it good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have comes with whammy bar thats what i know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your amp edit so now that amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that i have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit i have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning i ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use very secure the best i ve used so far i ve bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags sturdy stable and reliable not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
157	so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it i ve used this in my jam lab for years and use it every time i play electric about hours a week the unit itself has held up well no problems with case or pedals all switches knobs plugs display work fine it doesn t have a on off switch but that s minor it s low profile and is easy to switch by foot i have it going into my mixer which works fine no feedback or buzz from it i like the recording software cubase that came with it i didn t think i d use it much but i do it s fun and easy to record my own songs cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close but i ve learned nothing happens and it s fine i don t use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man which if you don t have you need it the drum presets are fun to use it s a blast to set a drum track loop a rhythm then jam on top of it isn t that what it s all about my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn t some flaw i guess also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak i don t like them at all the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone they rock i use alot of the other ones as well imho this the must have addition to your set up it s not for professional use but when i turn pro i ll get something better saves your thumb on the strum grips nicely in your fingers but not on the strings a totem of rock and roll in your grip i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the cheapies i ve been dealing with musician s friend forever rogue is musician s friend s brand music is a musician s friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars i have several different models of rogue guitars and i m impressed with all of them the rogue ra is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the fender starcaster here s the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one once they realize it s not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten if you re not sure if you re serious about learning to play this is the guitar for you even if you re an intermediate to advanced player you still can t go wrong with this guitar it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument the finish and workmanship is also like what you d find on a more expensive guitar they look play and sound great many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price they figure a guitar that cheap can t be much good that s where they re wrong you have to actually play one to understand what i m talking about once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer this is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire if it happens to get damaged or stolen you re not out an arm and a leg i love fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar the rogue is a much better value than the fender and equal if not better in quality the rogue ra comes in a variety of color choices if or when you decide to sell it you can usually get back what you paid for it i give rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one i ve been playing guitar for years so i should know what i m talking about i do not own stock in musician s friend music or rogue guitars and i don t get paid to endorse them this review is my honest opinion i have never been let down by ernie ball strings they produce a bright clear sound and for every other string in their price range they are the best way to go i only use them and i have been playing for a decade they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings whenever i buy a new guitar and change out the factory strings i am always shocked at how much better my instrument sounds i have used fender medium picks since the late s yes they are made in china now but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell the picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip lock baggie all were in there all of them fender mediums purchased from b g music associates shipped from illinois to california in days with normal shipping the picks are great and i couldn t be happier with the order whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where i stand recommended if you want need a nice little bag of fender mediums this cable is really good for the price i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet would like to purchase another one in the future buy it it s worth it as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock this case however fits my dot custom like a glove the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level didn t expect much for the price but this is a top notch case for any of the epiphone gibson semi hollowbody guitars great deal to protect your investment i haven t measured signal throughput so i can t comment on that but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle this thing simply will not crimp will not kink up on itself does not get twisted and has no tension in it it s the easiest handling cable i ve ever dealt with a real pleasure when you ve got all kinds of wires running all over it s like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections i have a footer with one right angle connection and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a telecaster
158	my son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass jazz band and his standup bass chamber orchestra it is solid yet flexible in height and angle assembly was a breeze this is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use built like a tank should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family this is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most it will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets which i love some people have complained about plastic hinges being fragile but they are fine if you don t use excessive muscle it s survived my clumsiness and i can load it with pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat the m is well built sturdy and well balanced enough that i have no concerns about tipping even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music the tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort once in place it stays there with no slipping for all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car this is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives and i always have some concern that it will not be what i want when i get it in this case it is a winner delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed the design of this product is innovative and excellent i haven t used it for as long as i would generally like before writing amazon reviews of purchased items and so cannot testify to its reliability but suffice to say that for the price it would be hard to beat the display is very clear and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous i wonder how i ever lived without it before for live gigs playing electric i would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable as noisy environments probably wouldn t be ideal for this tuner this is more for your parlor acoustic setup
159	tremendous mic love the case and shockmount being all inclusive got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home portable studio love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic i run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear there is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voice over applications it does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone note use a good preamp or a external eq tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception excellent sound quality premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station you can t go wrong with these we re ordering more pairs this is one of the best mics in this price range it sounds incredible and at this price it s unbeatable i only use three mics and this is my main vocal drum overhead and acoustic guitar mic although i use two mics on the guitar my other mic s are a sm which is incredible and not crazy expensive and an audio technica instrument vocal mic i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks these microphones were made for the studio i used it for live performance you better have a good pa system to enjoy the sound there everything that the video showed it s a great microphone period top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon for a microphone at amazon may not be the best mic out there but for home studios this one marks the spot get it if you re on a budget i love this product it came fast included extra shockmount line shockmount an adapter the mic instructions and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting the sound quality is great with the art tube preamp use mic cables not cables for phantom power and i couldn t be happier with it it even looks impressive although i do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny when in reality it is this off silver color almost a gold but not quite it s not bad or anything just different and frankly the thing could be purple for all i care as long as it produces great sound that s all that matters great product and extremely affordable no complaints a nice addition to my recording home studio i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer i am very happy with how it performs in both situations high quality solid support and good design decisions all around the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to i will try to add pictures when i get a chance this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also man ya ll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it s all good and stuff man because like when you be spittin some sik leerix and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me ay yo let s go
160	i have a taylor ga e the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright i tried some martins ej s which i love on my seagull s however those strings just didn t have enough bass and too much highs i bought these recently and i love them they are much better then the original strings very rich bass that really comes out the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have now off to buy some different bridge materials edit i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow every time i come back to it after several weeks i forget that i put the ls on it then i pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are john pearse strings worth every penny everyone has there opinions i was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of john what i can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time sound really nice on my taylor ce this is my thrid levy s strap and it is as good as the rest of them that i have had for a few years i have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others i have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but i don t see a problem with it so far and i use it regularly i have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer but it is a standard size i prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials for the price the strap works well and i would buy more levy s straps if needed i usually use martin sp s but i decided to give these a try i m pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sp s i did a little recording with them and i have to admit they sounded a little brittle
161	i ve been able to purchase of these in different sizes for all my pickin pals lightweight easy to transport in the back of your amp or just put it in a bag with your music these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work i mean really work well too not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise they are the bomb whee this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double leather ends the color stands out well on the black background available in various colors i purchased several thicknesses for my son so he can test them all to determine which ones he liked best these are not the ones he likes i would not get these again in this size a little too stiff the quality of the picks and grip are great and that is why i rated stars the stiffness is just due to preference please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help the screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn t have to carry so many parts nope doesn t fit a squire affinity just fyi
162	i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these they fit great and plenty of screws i am going to replace all my old screws with these this gator case is very good i m use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one these guitar strings are very nice and i love them i always buy this brand they work well and sound amazing the graphtech pq c tusq fully compensated acoustic guitar saddle will replace any broken or worn saddle to give you a very food sound that may require just a little sanding to make it fit perfect for your guitar
163	genius idea that i wish i thought of first i actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place i would definitely recommend this piece of plastic is just terrible you d be better off with a couple of books and a towel not recommended this device is ok it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable convenient storage is its biggest plus i probably should buy another one for other guitars but i carry in my electric case i m sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for strings it winds it cuts you really can t go wrong here another really well made product from planet waves that will become an indespensable part of your guitar setup just recieved my stand it fits the mandolin perfect it also fits my wifes ukelele so i ordered a second one this morning its made very well is compact once its folded up the price was awesome i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment thank you so much i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back at first it seemed unstable but then i tried to open it up a little more and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here when it s opened up all the way it is relatively stable and is suitable for servicing your own guitar as others say it does fold up nicely and takes up minimal space in my toolbox i wouldn t use this if i made a living servicing guitars as i don t think it would last long due to the quality of materials it does feel pretty cheap but it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while i imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt over all i m happy with the purchase as it suits my needs get strap for the price does what it is supposed to do and is comfortable too glad i purchased it lifesaver i bought this and a planet wave s o port which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well i use this at every show where i have to plug in this is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn t want to worry about feedback i ve been using this stuff for about years or so and i really don t play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy i have purchased and used many various types of guitar string winders and i must admit that the planet waves pro winder is the very best i have used to date it is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings pull pegs etc it is sturdy and should last many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement because of the affordable price on amazon i will be buying some for my friends as christmas stocking stuffers the planet waves pro winder is well worth the cost and i recommend it to anyone also with the string winder i also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping free shipping which promised that the items would be shipped within to days the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday three short days treat yourself thank you amazon these are great they re small light weight easy to read accurate inexpensive this one offers an additional feature tap tempo metronome i was expecting something a little bigger it will do but next time i probably will look for something with a little more stability what can i say they look great and were cheap my kind of product bought them to replace the old vintage style knobs on my lp clone much nicer looking go build your own build it to your specs and have a solid stand if not you can find a lot better head stands this one was a huge disappointment does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick im back with my wood block and am happy this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on
164	put these on my g l s electric sound great play great keeping their tune none broken yet but i don t usually break strings i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs blues blues slide rock metal i use d addario strings a lot i try others but always come back to them these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on i really like them i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recording producing i absolutely love these picks and swear by them i ve been a guitarist for almost years and these were the picks that i landed on years ago and stuck to i ve had years of lessons licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms i d order again if i had to i had purchased a different strap for my f style mandolin and it was adequate but when i learned of this neotech strap and how adjustable it was i ordered it and tossed my earlier strap this should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well my only complaint is that the button hole doesn t stay on the end pin of my epiphone mandolin i solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick i wasn t happy with drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn t fallen off since over months of daily playing i like the product a lot for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect it is not so long as i thought i though it would be like the piano s sustainer but it s a good pedal effect my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect thank you these are the thickest picks i ve ever used however i am really liking them the tone they give seems better to my ears than anything i ve tried and my speed picking has improved tried them all these are the best sounding in my book they last pretty long for non coated strings and play nicely too i ve been playing with this a lot since i got it last week it really is versatile as well as noiseless i ve mostly used it with the default settings i haven t had the time to tweak it as much as i d like but i can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it really impressed with this wah
165	i have many heavy guitars yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers i m neither however my back was still hurting and i m definitely a weakling so i bought this shoulder pad now i only look like a weakling to the more eagle eyed people who see me play guitar thanks planet waves really though it s quite good i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes the stock tuners have one peg these have two despite this installing them was quite easy they have a high build quality and work great i was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first but now i m glad i did i bought this specifically for a gt it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it there is enough room in the front pocket for the power supply input and output cables and maybe a little more i was also able to put a binder in on top of the gt which sort of protects the screens and knobs a bit more and provides a place for the stupid lead sheet binder than never fits in my other cases this bag is a good size as just an accessory bag to carry along with a guitar and a combo amp if you have a couple pedals and cables or some odds and ends you want to bring along pros looks like the same basic quality as my other gator bags gt fits like a snug glove with just a little use it will be perfect front pocket reasonable pricecons they cost reduced their logo from a thread stiched logo to a cheap vinyl like silk screen or iron on patch unlike product photo and it doesn t match all my other gator bags not a big deal but worth mention other similar gator bags i own have a wrap around padded handle that velcros the two handles together once the bag is closed this does not overall good product but would have liked that other padded wrap around handle and the non cost reduced logo i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet but the wallet hasn t arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater but i suspected it would be before i ordered it so i don t count that against it holds medium picks with grip exceptionally tight almost annoyingly hard to get one out will be sure to update if wear tear has any effect on the grip on the picks but so far so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends i ve owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value i m and weigh there are numerous adjustment angles that i can switch to and be comfortable and i m not concerned about the legs bending the photo makes them look weaker than they are great little time saver with all that is needed to restring in one compact device it works well pretty good buy grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand but i guess that s how all of them are works very well on acoustic guitars
166	works great for my acoustic dreadnought if i had any complaint it would be that there s nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall it would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger a little cushion that would go between the wall and the guitar no reason i can t make something like that on my own though edit just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won t fit into this hanger nothing worth complaining about but just something to note if you need a hanger for a classical guitar this isn t it this is a really nice item and i got two of them unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and i had to force it which has created a little wobble that s the problem with mail order sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it oh well so far its working ok with the my old classical beater guitar i have hanging on the faulty one the other unit seems to be rock solid oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar this levy s leathers inch cotton guitar strap is good looking in an understated sort of way very well made adjustable and extremely comfortable and works exactly as expected we bought this for my son as a starter strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future highly recommended cfh this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does it s job no scratches or anything on my taylor it falls over now and then but only when i run into it perfect for hanging displaying your guitars very sturdy they hold up well to both my bass or guitar without moving or flexing both are on the heavy end i own now and will definitely buy more if i expand my collection i like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe i bought of these and have had them for a year now and they have yet to let me down my daughter still gets to them and tries to pull them off but she has yet to succeed very solid constriction i like that they pivot so if my daughter pulls them to the left or the right the piece moves with it and returns it back to balance once she is finished excellent design have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time attaches to my audio interface no cable switching didn t need the sophistication of other mixers costing x as much fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording shipped in time didn t test microphones yet but i think this is best price for microphones according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well i ll check it later say it all but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece a great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic squire the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar my daughter loves it instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice installs in minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers if you don t like loading up the tuners trim a few inches off the leads they re about inches and have no cloth covering like fenders i usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the flexsteels have overall less tension i let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing yeah ironic for a set designed for slapping gave them a good stretch and they re holding pitch well i find the windings on the flexsteels more comfortable than rotosounds at least comparing new to new that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting overall i m more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there s plenty of piano low end sproing squire lake and ray bennett fans will feel right at home fingers or pick the set is so bright sounding in fact i had to roll a considerable amount off the label says light top medium bottom i found the gauge balance between the low e a and the high d g a little more pronounced than i d like but not outright uncomfortable i am absolutely delighted with this tunner one comment my son has one also the neck of his broke so he warned me i am always very careful when turning the head i can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen as far as tuning goes i am very pleased i moved from a guitar to a harp so i am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful plus my vision is not the best and this one i can really see very nice case for the price solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my epiphone lp would definately recommend these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws the screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so i would recommend you buy some good screws before you install i have several of these and at least three screws broke as i screwed them into the stud in the wall i use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed i also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it breaks down to a reasonable size for transport i can t find a single complain about this amp the amp modelling is fantastic plug in for a mic cd m player quality driver i m not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website i used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds but you can t ask for much more for the price of you won t be disappointed with this amp these will pluck guitar and bass strings decently if you want one set to cover both applications this is a good choice this design is a big improvement over string swings past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch i will buy more if i get another guitar i have been using this pre amp for a year and it has been great after i figured out that you have to attach a ground cable to the record player it installed very easily just plug it in and it plays i have not noticed any excess heat or other problems even though i keep it inside of my closed entertainment stand i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge strings in both phosphor bronze and bronze instead of writing a separate review for each i figured i d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f rc guitar it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce i have always heard that phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a rosewood guitar i would agree the tone is nicely balanced maybe a bit weak in the bass but the strings are new and in a couple days i expect them to sound a bit better the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone the nanoweb coating is nice it protects the strings from corrosion finger sweat really can do a job on strings without dulling the sound i think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original guild strings and it just plays easier the strings are mounted on a gibson hummingbird an iconic mahogany body spruce topped dreadnaught sized guitar again s are recommended for mahogany guitars as popular as the hummingbird is i was never totally pleased with the sound of it it is a great guitar to strum along with while singing but it almost sounded too muddied not enough articulation between the different strings the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play the strings are easier to play partially because of the coating partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity without going out of tune the bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes i am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the martin sps that were on it prior to the switch elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings in the end you won t spend more money on what i think are far superior strings how much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand first it a great price about the same as a big mac lol second it fits great does exactly what it s supposed to do third now that i use a pick holder i wonder why i never did so before i do have a tendency to break drop or even wear out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency i have some solid heavier weighted stands that stand up to a quick grab of a pick from this holder but when using one of my cheaper lighter tripod style stands i make sure i m careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so i don t pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick great product couldn t live without it lol and it s not the manufacturer s fault i have some cheap light weight stands if you re looking for a pick holder i can t think of any reason not to try this one this is a very simple product but one which fulfills its intended purpose of hanging guitars on the wall this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck this harmonica is great for beginners or professionals i know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones highly recommended plays sounds feels and looks great also comes with a little note sheet i use this with my audio technica condensor works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain it s not bulky which is a nice i had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s im gonna by me one lol i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy now if i can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand or to the desk where i sit and play maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument yeah i think a few of these would be nice i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall if you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good tight spacing i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn t be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures so i will have to do new pictures but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack decker bdl av all in one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about minutes i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional looking installation as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shape i do not however recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately edit i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in it took about minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line at any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go this is one great piece the quality of the guitar is amazing and for its price outstanding it plays beautifully with my w amp and with my experience of guitars this is a go getter otherwise i would see this one stand out to a les paul
167	not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic pivots in direction only not the best build quality in the world actually fairly thin plastic but for what else can you ask for should last a few months at least great tuner it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar i will buy another one of this i own two of these the first did not have a compartment door so things just roll around inside case not happy but this one is just fine looks great no i would not take it on tour but as far as run around and taking lessons its safe all latches match up well enjoy will order again i like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for and it works well for most of my ibanez mxr and boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket it doesn t seem to work so well with my vox wah my old mxr distortion plus and my fulltone pedals i m using the v battery adaptor for the wah and my dist and i get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain and intermittant operating problems with the dist i get a slightly louder hum from the fulltone pedals when they re on but my newer boss ibanez mxr pedals have no issues at all the one spot is not a regulated power supply if it was they d say so so maybe that s the culprit not sure it only holds heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to except i did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars these are good don t get me wrong holds my picks in place nicely snaps on microphone stand firmly never come up short again its just a nice accessory to have and cheap too i love these dunlop capos they are quick to put on grip nicely and above all they don t get in the way of your hand i bought of them from amazon because they were such a good price we bought the pyle pro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma we needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice for the price this worked a lot better than i expected but it did take some adjustment to the trim screw on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed we also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn t hanging in front of the speaker this might not be an issue for you depending on where you plug yours in there are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that i m sure would provide better sound and range but this one works just fine for our uses overall a good value for the low cost of this unit i purchased the l pack picks for my son who just started playing the guitar as in all beginners they want the best and he loves the color and design it hold my picks well but some are to big for it and the tape foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly im neutral on this one before bying this product i doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings i received it and the first thing i did is try it it cuts the medal strings like butter i used to use whatever i could find around the house which was a pain because nothing i tried could cut these metal strings the winder i m not going to use but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it although i didn t purchase my snark sn on amazon i wanted to share my excellent customer service experience about a company that clearly cares about its customers i had a problem with my snark and the company displayed first class customer service exceeding my expectations the sn is a must have as far as i m concerned i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner so much easier to use and i like the logical incremental led display that shows if you re flat or sharp on my iphone the app i ve been using doesn t always display the frequency when i m really out of tune so i have no visual indicator of where the tuning is at if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case snark not only shows you with the bar display but also displays the notes your string is playing much easier you don t need to select your tuning or anything first it picks up your frequency on whatever string you re on and you simply dial it in great sturdy clip with a well thought out foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric i usually just leave the snark on my music stand where i can use the visual metronome you can also just clip it to a nearby desk buy this with confidence you ll love it edit although i still love this little tuner my model has suffered a few issues which i will address here i m not certain if it s a design flaw or not but the little plastic pieces that serve as the socket joint on both ends of the adjustable ball arm have a tendency to snap off i think the manufacturer should look into this and perhaps design a single ring of plastic which may have more integrity also the rubber feet fell off long ago with very moderate use at my home the electronics themselves have held up admirably does what it says i live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do this is obviously higher quality well made a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one i wasn t quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards i figured i d give this a try i am so glad i did i could not believe how much residue was on the rag after i cleaned the fret board yuk then i used the treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color i d like to say it looks like new but the guitar is a so that would be a stretch but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new i used it on one of my less valuable acoustics but it s still a usa made fender i have such faith in this that i m going to do my gibson acoustic next then i have a couple of electrics i will do when i change strings on them this stuff is great it didn t seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless it may work well with dunlop picks but not for theplanet waves standard guitar picks duralin blue gt medium heavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold it has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot i ve found it mostly not useful thus far maybe it would help more when playing live so i can grab for a pick and know they will be there earnie ball s guitar strap locks are great in my opinion the best there way over other brands like dunlop schaller and many others i have them installed on my les paul axcess and my jackson dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging you can definetely trust them to do their job they also look great highly recommended i seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and i have great access to it fantastic simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end appropiately priced good value not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a guitar arrived before projected delivery date the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar these are my favorite picks to play with the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic to everyone who plays flat picking guitar i m sure you all have your own choice of pick do you even remember why you picked the style you use somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain i quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something i would use but as i said it s ok i am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar and it seems to work fine no complains i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely tuned them down to a sharp b flat and they sounded sweet back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone this is for the price i paid for it here on amazon far less than what it is currently selling for a very good buy at the current price of almost bucks i would pass or look at other options but that is just me the leather is attractive thick enough soft enough for the price and i found the length to be more than long enough for me personally i almost have it on the shortest possible setting and there is far more room to let out only really tall people big people or low players will be disappointed perhaps i only have a few very minor complaints and of course my complaints are subjective so ymmv one the back side of the strap is not black it s a blue grey color and i didn t realize that you can see a tiny bit of the greyish color in the photo but not enough to really get an idea of what the backside looks like i assumed incorrectly that both sides were black two the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes all that said it is nice and some will love it quality at the right price easy to adjust looks like it will last solid four stars despite me personal opinion this brand has never disappointed me regardless of the diameter of the strings to me they just sound complete even the light strings don t sound tinny which amazed me compared to other big names they complement my washburns very well though they are not top of the line models i often get compliments like you re guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone but it s been a trial error for me i found that my washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra great buy yes i think you should try these if you re looking at them then get them they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w o any pick experience i don t drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w o looking this arrived a week sooner then expected i am very happy with this bag my fender lh san miguel acoustic guitar fits perfectly it is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry this is a very good strap lock system i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap recommended it s a little harder to open than other capos i ve used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it it s not cheap and flimsy though i don t see this one wearing down anytime soon now stop reading this review and buy this capo you wont regret it i have ordered several of these like or i love them they are great for holding picks make wonderful gifts planet waves signature guitar picks always the best always reliable an excellent useful product that i not only use myself but often give as gifts to other musicians michael haller captain soul s sound circus this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed i have these straps on all my gear very well made will last a lifetime i can t compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder i use i have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar i own and every student i ve ever had has one on their guitar as well they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding they stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time they can be easily removed and relocated after relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location i have had as many as picks stored in one and as few as one pick stored in others no matter how many picks you store or for how long the spring action loader never loses its resistance i highly recommend these i personally will never even try any others as i am so pleased with this product if you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks this is the product for you the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference for my style the dunlop tortex is perfect the surface is matte and not too slick i don t think i have ever worn one down to being unusable they seem to last forever or until they re lost i ve tried other brands and picks made of other materials but i always come back to these i ll probably be buried with one in my hand i am a beginner guitar player so i don t have too much experience with different types of strings but i can say that when compared to the stock strings of my fender acoustic guitar these things are like night and day a much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers highly recommended had no issues in the months there is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your real picks which helps with its looks i have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body people watching me can t really see it and it s right where i need it full of picks if i drop one wonderful little invention buy it if you don t want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket really a nice mic i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs makes my voice sound fantastic i read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mine worth a shot if you re on a budget like me my picks fall out way too easy while i m playing live the name martin says it all has for many many years grab some extras because you will want more great price great strings love the holder and the picks looke great and nice and i don t have to look around for my picks when i m ready to play my guitar perfect size and does it s job had one pick inside as a place holder stick tape holds it anywhere you want it cheap and easy the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design it will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item the shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item if you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere i just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it they really help me out and they are a cheap price i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack i m not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with this rack is constructed better than i had really expected it s easy to adjust however i found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward getting he harmonica unto te spring loaded holder can be a bit tricky still this is a good deal not much to say here strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player you need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style these are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years i replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping times a year the strings are great priced great and was on sale which made it even better there is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that s good too i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy now if i can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand or to the desk where i sit and play maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument yeah i think a few of these would be nice it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks it does exactly what it says it does its also very cheap ever since i saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used jazz picks and after having tried them that he simply couldn t use an other pick i decided to try them out and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks i always had issues holding picks and keeping them put while i played and the jazz iii was no exception so it didn t bother me meaning i didn t really feel like there was a problem other than me being that problem then i read about this new ultex thingyit looked like a jazz iii and every one seemed to like it sooo i figured why not have a go at it i was skeptical about this impossible to drop thing which i read so i was dieing to feel them well they came i tried them and after playing for a while i didn t even notice that i hadn t once readjusted my pick not once it was like there was no pick i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be it stays there to me that s just freaking incredible holy wow i love this thing love it love it this tuner is awsome it tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner
168	simple effective just what i wanted seems a tad flimsy but time will tell tuning couldn t be easier neat product nice one small soft cheap cable with comfortable lenght nothing else i can say take it for cheap guitars so i recently purchased the visual sound one spot combo pack and i must say i am quite pleased i was checking out some of the higher end products t rex fuel tank voodoo lab pedal power and just didn t feel like forking over the money maybe one day if i m going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around i ll go for one of the other products but from what i read on the visual one power supply i was willing to take a risk especially for the great price currently i m powering hardwire pedals a dunlop wah pedal and the berhinger cs see i m cheap sometimes but effectively so so i m already using of the power supply cables all pedals are powered without issue without noise there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect whatsoever i can t say enough how excited i was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board i just put together and when it came through and worked flawlessly it was all the better i would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals or even a moderate or novice player it s simply a reliable and affordable way to power your pedal board thumbs up and stars rock on i m using these cables to string effects pedals together i ve had no issues with them so far they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and i m not noticing any extra noise the behringer acx is a good looking great sounding amp in a small package but should be used at low to medium volume at higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange and also use the anti feedback button to avoid a muddy sound from too much distorted bass this not an amp to play loudly but rather for low to mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue as to the sound effects it is great with effects covering reverb chorus delay echo and many combinations i especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel the cd mp input is good for backgrounds or maybe drum machine when playing or music during breaks although one needs a cable with rca plugs to connect it lack of a headphone jack is a drawback but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offers overall a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price if you don t plan to crank it up too much a great little amplifier good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around i replaced the stock speaker with an eminence rajun cajun which has improved the tone and provided increased volume the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs i would highly recommend love these picks have used them for years feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever highly recommend i bought these strings to try on my guitars they sound good on a variety of models like sg les paul rickenbacker they have a melodic tone and good intonation and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape i started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in december of and continue to do so to this very day he absolutely swears by them he does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in hawaii makes them prone to rusting other than that the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there this worked well for me from about to feet sound was good and it was easy to set up good for the price and no regrets no complaints about this hardware easy to install with patience easy to use the click on off system securely holds your strap and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post these work like a light switch on off so i m not sure how you can rate them as poor there aren t really any directions so it takes a little mechanical knowledge just a little it s not rocket science to make them work quality metal secure function and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts i ve installed these on a hoener full sized squire acoustic and fender strat s i bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth i like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std telecaster input jack great the flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked these do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage i have more expensive cables but rather use these i have had these on a les paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars does what it says it will do keeps your strap locked on i have had zero issues with these the installation takes minutes and has stood up to countless hours of play highly recommended great little piece of leather does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar thank you the tascam dp ex is great i love this little box it s got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop here are a few of the features that i really like about it it s portable and runs on aa batteries it has compression exciter de esser as well as eq and reverb it has a mastering section with effects you can record tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks it feels sturdy not that i would drop it just to name a few i compared this against the fostex mr mkii which i also own and like the tascam has more features for the buck as well it should as it just came out this year and the fostex has been around a while as another reviewer put it this won t replace your daw i can record some very polished songs on my laptop but the tascam does come close the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too i have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience the portability factor is huge in my opinion being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs or vice versa is great plus it s fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas i totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section five stars behringer doesn t have the best of reputations but some of their gear does a great job at the price this is one of them this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface i needed this because sometimes i need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording monitoring a track my main headphones are beyerdynamic dt pro sennheiser hd sony mdr v and then i have some others all of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and i get very good volume and even at the exact same volume as the input i find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp it s hard to describe but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger i ve had a presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better the volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that i can hear that is introduced by this amp make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in for instance if i run a cable from my imac s built in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume i can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds but that s not the amp it s the source running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong there are some annoying things about this amp obviously the external power supply is annoying there s no on off switch and it s light enough that when everything is plugged in it doesn t want to stay in place however that s nothing that velcro tape on the desk can t fix and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones second one i bought lousy build quality and only lasted months went through two of these before i learned my lesson don t waste your money on this junk i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk people like it who am i to disagree it works well but i wish i had discovered the gibson app on my iphone before i bought but for the price it does work a lot better never clip it to any body parts only on you guitar don t ask only kidding unless you know what you re doing these things are too small if you feel comfortable with your picking skills the size and stiffness along with the built in grip are pretty good these are for lead and not rhythm the picture won t show it but they are about the size of a dime i got a couple of these only buy this cable if there is no chance that it will be ever used in the real world after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug and of course since this cord is molded sealed up tight it can t be repaired you could cut off the plug and solder a good inch plug on it but why bother just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord this cord is too flimsy its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing but inside its junk thrown away money buy a lottery scratch off instead i haven t used the cable yet but it looks new and durable the cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what i expected can t wait for the rest of my gear to get here so i can do a sound test based on physical condition i would recommend this product some have complained that it s construction is not the best i actually had to send the first one back because it did not work but a new one came the day after i lodged a request for a replacement it s a very simple echo device i use just to give my guitar a little bounce i prefer to play dry most of the time so as to define better what i m doing but some solos need a little filling and this keeps it subtle it can do a lot more but it s what i wanted sturdy enough well priced and simple to use cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use still highly recommended for the money i m new to acoustic so i m not too sure how things go but from what i have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good a little to thick for my style though they make a very deep and loud noise i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic they sound much better and aren t quite as loud in this price point it s a good capo if you know how to put one on and use it i use it for lessons in case a kid steals it so i m not losing my g capo which was great capo i figured i would splurge and buy these just to have some backup cables when i wear out the cheap guitar center ones and have some that match they are well built and feel like they can take some abuse i will probably but more packs shortly to switch out all my cables great case for my epiphone sheraton ii if you own a dot sheraton or a you should buy this case it comes with a key so you can lock it this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack it is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but that s an easy adaption if using a copy strat it works perfectly great price from the seller as well if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now great connection sounds good and no issues at all these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm series form factor i use mine for the much heavierblue microphones encore studio grade dynamic performance microphone and this clip holds it right where i adjust it to the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision machined mine effortlessly mate with anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom black anon stage stands b tripod boom microphone standand amusician s gear die cast mic stand black which are the only stands with which i ve used this clip bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the shure sm and pg and similar or a different brand that uses that form factor then this clip will probably not work also i cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares actually you should do that i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model i have five or six on hand including a few spares and if i needed more clips this is the one i would purchase like many others here have pointed out this is a very good leather strap at a very good price and it is made in canada it is a simple design but it is plenty long enough for a taller than average player is solidly made and did you notice how low the price is i have looked at leather straps for some time and could never pull the trigger on ordering one because of sticker shock on the price most straps i have seen in guitar stores of this quality start in the price category i just cannot justify spending or or more for an overpriced version of this same guitar strap which has some fancy brand name label on it and is of no better quality this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap a nylon strap may work adequately but lacks any real sense of style also most of the name brand straps are two inch or three inch wide and this inch wide strap is just right for me i like this strap so much i am now placing an order for one in every colour i can find them in for use with my other guitars what can i say it works i think i could write a book here not just a solid little mic holder glad i bought it great price and quality it is nice to not have to connect two pedals inches away with a cable clear amazing cable very underrated incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall these exl gauge d addarios are good strings at a good price they sound nice and bright on my epiphone sheraton ii and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale which i like i d rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time the strings don t break either i ve purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one for the it s the best buy in my opinion i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is i really like the right angle plug for my amp it doesn t make the wire stick out like a straight plug would good stuff well this cable certainly didn t last long as the title says weeks bought a new fender mustang v amp a week and a half ago last night amp would turn on but wasn t putting out any sound from the guitar messed around a bit and it started to work today same thing and it s obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn t very happy got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a cord maybe i m just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i d return it not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund will just move on to another company s cord the cable died on me in less than a month very disappointed in built quality so these are pretty great strings not much to say the price is really good about ten dollars a set which is really good easy to use does a great job and comes off when you want it to and does not scratch or harm guitar in any way great price as well i got two of them havent used this one yet i got it to run to my pedal board for those stages where the backline is not easily accessible seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general i initially wanted a yamaha pacifica dlx guitar center in eugene claimed to have stock in website but when i reached there there wasn t any so i tested an affinity and a bullet hss instead and thought the bullet was pretty ok but they did not have the color i wanted so i ordered through amazon but i bought a microcube from guitar center as i m greatful for the opportunity to test guitars i waited for weeks before i make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression i received the guitar in perfect condition it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors just a few words squier by fender new strings and scratch free made in china it says however it did not have sharp frets like i experience with some bucks guitarsthe action came very high and i had intended to return it but the guitar was perfect and i couldn t find any fault to return so i proceed to setup the guitar through long and painful steps straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod then measured the string action height and set it from mm for the first strings and mm for the last strings setup the intonation using a tuner you really need a tuner for this step after that the guitar was splendid it did go out of tune in or days but stabilized after that i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning after weeks i m still loving the guitar beginners be warned you may like the action or may need to do setup like i did in fact i m so impressed with squier that i m thinking of getting the squier standard strat next pretty curious of the alnico pups latest review downgraded from to stars i bought a washburn rx with duncan usm the bullet is nice but i outgrew it the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive the bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings tusq nut locking the trem down etc i d recommend to save some money and buy something above guitars at that price may be twice the cost but is more than twice better the important things are not in bullet the sustain and the sound latest review the product is back at stars i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short like attack finger plucking
169	this is a nice cable made from good materials and is attractive i needed a foot cable and im glad i didn t buy one from the store i m not one to use picks much so when i do i prefer a light pick i will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because will last a very long time it is fun to share for those needing a light pick go for these recommended i have this pop filter clamped onto myon stage stands ms tripod boom microphone standthe pop filter is double layered and spaced out fairly well it provides at extra layer to reduce the p s f s t s etc it also is good for preventing moisture and spit from going into your precious microphone surprisingly the gooseneck really does not make any noise when you move it the gooseneck is sturdy it is flexible yet stationary this product does exactly what it intends to do with a quality build buy with confidence what can i say this is a xlr cable i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables this one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest good strings these little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks i simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead and they produce no audible hum into the circuit they are unbalanced jacks though note the single black band at the end of the plug so if you need balanced jacks for your system those with two black bands make sure you take that into account before ordering by the way i have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording just saying
170	pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway good price i already had the other two snarks and then i borrowed this version in a shop from another patron the readout is cool makes me feel good inside to look at it elderly pickers like me fumble conventional picks onto the floor particularly when the skin is dry during winter the grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that the material used for the core gives a slightly softer tone than the fender mediums i have used for years i like the graduated feel these picks have with a slight give in the center allowing the player to vary the pick attack between strumming and picking single notes these picks r awsome i have tremmors in my hands and have a hard thime with pick control they have a gell center whitch tingles it feels like muscles are activating in your hand great theraputic picki seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks these picks have a indentation so u know where put ur thumb and index fingerthey really do what they say if u have hand problems try these they really work nice picks a bit small for my preference great for picking kind of harsh for strumming quality seems top notch some guitarists will love these i don t know if they are the best haven t tried them all but from what i ve tried none are better d addarios are top quality and very reasonably priced my choice for string or string acoustics extra light gives good action for my small guitar not so hard on the fingers tone is not bad but not same as or gauge i absolutely love these picks grips really well in your hand plays like a dream i just wish more came in the pack i would highly recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play dava picks are one of life s guilty little pleasures they may seem pricey for picks but they re still not that expensive i bought this batch of picks when i realized my davas from three years back were all gone i use these to play slide i also have fender and musician s friend picks but those are just the standard flat stamped out pieces of plastic the davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control and they just plain feel good to use the other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide but with dava you get a great grip i have two of these stands the electric guitar bass version and the acoustic version back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case yes folded up it will fit in my tweed fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar i do always keep it in the included stand bag to ensure i don t scratch or bump it against my guitar great at this price too buy several
171	i agree with all the other reviews these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack unless you make money with your headphones or have money to burn you probably don t need anything better than the m s the only thing i would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans they make the headphones take up less room when folded good for travelling but i m old fashioned and prefer rigid phones they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don t have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation no big deal though comes with nice screw on to adaptor high end pick felt comfortable even with its larger size took awhile to get used to but really liked it most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything i would say however i still want to say i love this tool not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt it s been useful to help me learn the letters of keys slowly i am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that i know where i am on the fretboard where i can go from there i use it by putting it on my music stand dialing in the key i want turn on the drum machine simply play the chords in that key to the beat then when i want to practice the relevant scales of the key i simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note it s that easy i will say that i do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned to really grasp it one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka moment from time to time more falls into place unlike some others i m not one to lug something this around in my gig bag who really is going to set study material like this prior to a gig that s what you do at home and it s called practice for a reason i give this out of stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory if not you may want to take some lessons then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons this pick will give you a distinct tone because it s made of metal not plastic i m sure it won t wear out any time soon either the size is regular i just wish it had a sharper point but i can still pick fast enough with it to play speed metal i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect then i re ordered and i got what i think was an acoustic type because they were the same mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold so i just ended up with two dozen wasted picks so just make sure you get the right one update okay so i just realized that there are dunlop stubby picks and then there are dunlop big stubby picks sorry
172	this is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely thick and durable made of awesome material buy it i bought this so i had no mess with cables on the board and i m happy to say it works perfectly it has everything you could ask for on a pedalboard and not only works with behringer i have suhr boss fender marshall dunlop and tc pedals and they fit very well it comes with cables and configuration diagram ideas not to mention it s a great advantage for taking it on the road without having to dissemble everything now my gear is always ready it s a pick everyone has their preference but i happen to like the s a lot and the powder y grip on these is a real bonus it take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are clean as well this is a sweet guitar strap i have a similar one but it has blue fire on it these are very durable straps that won t fall off your guitar so you can play confidently they are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it s expected since it s new my blue fire strap from dunlop is comfortable now since i ve used it for awhile so it s get better as you use it besides it being uncomfortable at first it s an awesome strap and i would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar this is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on amazon the strap feels sturdy and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy definitely glad i bought this nice sturdy construction for the most part although i don t like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends but for the price you get what you pay for i would have much better liked it if they were metal i put this on my les paul and it fit good but i decided it was not the look i wanted on that guitar so i put it on my bc rich instead the bc rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar so when i adjusted the length to a comfortable position the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back i ll give it a try for a while but i think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare the issue isn t whether it sounds exactly like a tube screamer the issue for me at least is does it sound good is it musical does it sound like an overdriven amp i say it does it sounds great for blues and rock i ve only had it for a couple weeks and i hope that it continues to work well for a long time i ve heard that these can be fragile but i m pretty gentle with my gear if it breaks i ll post about it
173	i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results it helped some but didn t get rid of the noise entirely it also makes the strings feel nice as well i will continue to use it i bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice very sturdy and well made stand and adjusts very easily even for a year old should last her a very long time i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe i ve been using this stuff for about years or so and i really don t play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy makes the strings nice and easy to fly over no buildup or residue on your fingers either i like this stuff i already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw i like that one more and overall quality seems better on it even though pricing was similar when i bought the first one and the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they don t line up just right but when i put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay and that s the important part for its hard to say anything bad about this gadget it s accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument the visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that s a silly extra that doesn t interfere with anything so no problem
174	picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me good deal will order again it can be confusing during the first time i used it but it becomes more easier as you go to the next drum very handy and gets the job done quickly wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better it does the job it was intended to do before using this i just hooked the strap to the buttons and didn t like it to confined and with the quick release it was more comfortable to use the strap i m glad i purchased this when i did i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly i buy one of these for each guitar but i only use my favorite strap if looking for that oriental sound this is it nicely made some folks expect something different i suspect it is not a cymbal that you use like a crash or ride it is more like a splash and at that it is for use for a particular sound highly recommend and when i bought it was very well priced like half what i could find used and this was new works as advertised i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work pretty simple even if you re technically challenged easy to use haven t gigged with it yet but i can imagine that this strap isn t going anywhere regarding its functionality not a pretty product but good stuff this saves so much time for getting strap on and off great design i love it worth the money and is built well no complaints at all i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux have had tons of compliments on the sound people can t belive its a dollar mic when i tell them such a fantastic price on this can t beat it this is a nice addition to a guitar that you don t want to drill a hole into for a strap button it s a quick release with the buckle one end stays on the strap the other around the head stock of the guitar makes it nice if you have more than one guitar without a strap button buy good quality guitar cord very low noise repairable effective strain releaf thick rubber cover this is a great buy under bucks for a quality cord of course i just got it it might not be durable but it looks durable if i change my mind about anything i will update my review for now i would say buy one joe using on a yamaha dreadnought acoustic goes one easy and feels sturdy thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric update ordered another for my seagull acoustic electric like the first one works great i bought to use for my squire strat it also fit my tele to a real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig if you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks i said good not loud loud enough yes i suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time this is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased great color and retro style as well came on time works very good strong spring that good start if needed i would buy another for me and my son it works great i love this product i t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast so y don t have to life it over your head well worth the price this was a filler item for a much larger order i am very interested in the straplocks so i decided to give them a try i sincerely like the concept handy well made small easy to see great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to not too much to say it s made out of foam made to slip between the strings made to hold two picks i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics my son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won t be dislodged still it does stay on majority of the time i do recommend this my son s guitar teacher calls this a fancy little pick holder and i ve had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time one must also be careful my son lost one of these so i know it is a possibility of it falling off he lost it after performing in a play on stage please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar i did see this device on amazon com and i decide to buy and try one i was pleasantly surprised with this guitar quick release system is working good with my acoustic guitar and because of that i did purchase more for my other guitar and for my friend one this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used for direct recording it does if used with an amp maybe but however you use it it is sweet not an exciting item i ll admit but they work as advertised and i do love having strap buttons on my instruments i recently acquired a guild six string that i strung with my usual ej strings however it just wasn t playing or sounding as good as i knew it could after tweaking the action and restringing with ej mediums that guild has sounds great with plenty of punch power to spare overall i rely on d addario strings for all my instruments what s not to love about a year old family owned company that beginning with the days of catgut has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations beyond great tone playability these suckers are reliable as all get out these days if a string breaks i know right away i need to check the nut saddle because these strings don t snap unless something on the instrument caused damage in fact i used to snap strings every other performance before i learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use nothing but d addario strings i haven t broken a string during a performance in years and believe me i ain t being gentle with em it serves its purpose doesn t hold as many pick as i expected looking back can t see why i really need it a plastic bag does fine in fact i don t think i ve ever used after the first time i put the picks in it i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag this levy s jacquard strap is well made and comfortable it was much cheaper here than any other place on line or at a brick and mortar arrived quite quickly but a tracking number would ve been nice otherwise no compaints simple enough right works as advertised a great simple idea that i m glad someone put into production for my taste the loop is too long where it wraps around at the headstock nut area so i just tied it up snug i had been using the martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto a plastic button and this is far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off of the button on the martin holder however folks with brand new shiny expensive guitars might want to take note while the nylon lace that wraps around is nice and strong it is fairly rough and abrasive and my experience is that it will very definitely wear at the finish of your git in that area won t rub the finish off or anything to that degree but if you re freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection on your guitar which i am not you will definitely notice the finish rubbed and dulled and even chipped a bit there at points of contact i can think of a million simple solutions to that but that s another story overall great little item
175	this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner the letters are big so you don t have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning good idea tends to slip on the strings however convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck it s a bent piece of metal with conveniently spaced slots and some sort of black coating powder coat paint who knows it s black it s heavy enough that it doesn t flex unnecessarily it has some heft to it so if you re trying to keep your rack super light be aware of that the coating is strong the pre stamped slots go sideways so that if your gear does come loose it slips sideways and not forwards protecting the knobs i recently had to drill additional holes in one for a homemade piece of gear with totally random mounting hole locations and it took a while to get through i like it enough that i bought another one i usually keep pick in my mouth when i don t use them but sometimes i drop them and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it so this is a nice option to have a spare one if you use bass picks get this it is bigger than the guitar version much like the picks
176	virtually eliminates all outside sound allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions nice flat response i purchased of these items to use with my band for the guitarists i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description i wasted my money don t waste yours perhaps viagra would be helpful love is a perfect microphone for karaoke and mobile dj live use it to provide live entertainment and i love your reception is perfect and not recommend it works well for my needs it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well a good buy i would recommend it for light to moderate use this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first i have no regrets all of the positive reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent guitar model are spot on if you re in the market and don t have a grand to spend on a new acoustic guitar get this north american made gem you won t regret it all guitarists know that there are billion strat copies out there they vary a bit but basically you have a light pickup versitale guitar that does that job that is about it but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more first the natural finish is what got me started it seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads i looked at fenders but except for the natural finish what was i getting for i wanted a strat copy that i could customize this is it i am putting split hot rail type pickups in this and wow i have a strat pickup lp and anything in between get one there s nothing complicated about this purchase it s a cable it works it doesn t cost a lot it s a great deal get it i use it every week and it still sounds perfect then again i never mistreat my equipment i am quite pleased with this product it s relatively inexpensive small and light weight it operates on two aa batteries included i use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily i should have ordered the cm clip on tuner at the same time placed a separate order later to allow to tune in a noisy music jam or band environment you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings there is also a note sound generator built in for reference pitches the metronome is pretty loud for the small size i have a hearing loss so if i can hear it even while playing it must be pretty good the speeds are from bpm you can select between two modes pendulum step preset values etc or full step which allows you to change incrementally by one etc beat tap allows you change the time signature from beats and also duplets triplets quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats it has a mini earphone jack for private use it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously i bought mine from austin bazaar shipping was free and fast i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging if you need a boom simply add anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackand you re good to go in addition to being indestructible this stand takes up far less stage or studio real estate than a tripod type stand like theon stage stands ms tripod boom microphone stand and despite the relatively small size of the base it is far more stable than the tripod stands admittedly this stand is a great deal heavier so if weight is an issue you may not like this type even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable for outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright which is not always the case with the tripod types moreover there are no legs to break i have lost one tripod stand to that problem if you transport your gear often and especially if you play outside or inside on cramped stages this stand is the best choice in my opinion nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well however the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic shure sm without collapsing better try another brand or spend a buck or two more to get a better product this arrived and when i tried to use it it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter instead these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip this is such a standard item that there is no excuse for making it with non standard threads and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard ths
177	i ve been using this for roughly a year now and it works fine it feels a bit cheap but then it is cheap it s not as easy to move as a spring loaded capo but it s also much lower profile overall i like it and it s certainly worth the minimal price boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet good for lead w single channel amps boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strength especially at lower practice volumes should be inexpensive this is an original gibson gear replacement part don t change your knobs or any kind of part in your gibson les paul sg or any other if not for the real deal i have a les paul and i definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years i returned this because i wanted the script version instead very different sound watch youtube to compare models this pedal seems older as well i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner the reason why is the led lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage the pitch black is nice and bold and bright one reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time so its a give and take issue simple and compact no clicking or buzzing perfect for old van halen solos like in you really got me plus you can get a swooshing bright sound you can t get with a flange and chorus when backing it down and playing clean play some old kiss or some rob zombie bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser isn t available in most amp emulators you know your man is working hard he s worth a deuce i have several mxr pedals every one is superb except for this phase the non script version reviewed here this phase is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion a swoosh of sonic dirt i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal s distortion suggest some modifications look up mxr phase mods and erik s corner will show you how i made the r c and c modifications the result a slightly improved phaser one that still churned out plenty of distortion finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot on no setting could i get rid of you guessed it distortion i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable no luck bottom line if you want a phaser that doesn t add significant distortion avoid this incarnation of the phase the mxr phase is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen at present i own an mxr phase a boss ph phase shifter and a line mm modulations modeler with a few phaser patches so i can compare these three units the phase has a single speed control that sets the rate of the phase so it is simple to use if there is a single knob that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit in this case i agree the mxr phase is by far the cheapest of these three units in my opinion it also gives the best sound within its capabilities and actually seems to boost the volume slightly the boss ph gets a slight volume drop but it is workable and the line mm has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because i usually don t leave modulations on for an entire song but turn them on off in different sections unless its a chorus of the three the phase has the least versatility you can imitate the phase sound on both of the other units the line mm does a slightly better job and both the ph and mm have more sonic possibilities also the boss ph will give a lot more spacey extremes than the phase which stays in a normal range but again of the three the mxr phase sounds the best of the three at what it can do bottom line a classic pedal at a great price great sound slight volume boost simple to use limited sonic possibility safe or normal guitar sounds no crazy extremes beautiful bright orange color you can t miss it compact size does not eat up pedalboard space
178	my daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great excellent price and product is as described and price was right i keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost what more could you want as expected from hosa another great product solid construction and great sound reproduced i would recomed this product to everyone this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use i don t have any problem with this stand at all and all of those people who have problems with the arms that move when you touch them that is part of the design it should not be a problem to you or your guitar thanks austin garcia nice to keep your mic nice and fresh plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath decent value i do not have much to say about this it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine i found myself actually trying to see if it will rip for the purposes of this review just so i could make some sort of comment about it you can rip it if you try but it s not likely to happen during everyday use it s fairly thick if that isn t what you want then i would look elsewhere this should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn t have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen great device and good price my wife made me try this for a gig we had it worked great i love the foggy effect on stage with a touch of lighting it really comes to life the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice i don t know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but i have another can of juice i bought to use later i will report on that i gave it stars although the fog juice is funky because it s not the fog juice that matters it s how the machine works it does what it should do the base for this thing is a monster the thing works great and because of the very strong load the base provides not the easiest thing to accidentally knock over not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar furthermore they are very accurate as well so worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time i want to change tunings bottom line inexpensive well made accurate time saving buy it now do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit that said for the price it is an excellent product obviously if you are looking for a studio quality mic you would not be here this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations for a normal use this is quite good feels little tiny but excellent gain i would buy it again if required fits the behringer xm perfectly it actually dampens the sound giving better a more smoother sound and reducing harsh parts of vocals what makes a good cable one that works i ve had these xlr cables fail because the pins get loose so i hope this doesn t happen to this one i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables they haven t had a huge amount of use but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise and i ve bought over of them the evans pedal patch will work for you great it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty i cheap buy and it works excellent blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store fit very well my mic awesome great for an amateur just like me hi guys really simple little review here this is a windscreen it does windscreen things pros it works it fits my microphonecons the package game a little smushed so it s a little misshapen it s it works if it s not the highest quality stop complaining it s what did you expect kevlar hosa guitar cables work great never had any problems with them i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations when the z party patrol is out and about the never leave without it if you re a professional and you re job is music then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality however if you re just doing it as a hobby side job or even just want the mics for a pa system then it s really hard to beat what you get in this deal here the deal is fantastic i use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and they ve been perfect for me this thing works wonders if you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot i recommend i hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels and this just is perfect for the job the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volume wah in pedal i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal the tuner works amazing as well i also love the fact that it connects to your amp via rj ethernet cable you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another however you cannot go wrong with those strings i highly recommend them i like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings i have tried what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen well it fits the rode m mic i was using nice and tight quality is good didn t tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine got this for a year old learning guitar they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner my how things change when you can see what is really going on recommended i definately helps cut down wind whistle on my mic can t say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad it does what it is suppose to works just as it should love it and a great price to boot this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use it is well made and i would buy it again if needed bought this cover to go with behringer mic it does what it s designed to do it was a little hard getting it onto the head of the mic but at least that way i know it s not going to be falling off during a performance or a recording session economical way to keep spit out of mic its ok the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can t complain about it not being worth what i paid for it i currently have this on my pedal board along with a digitech mainsqueeze which is less expensive more adjustable and just more versatile would i buy this yes if i didn t try anything else first nuff said for the price they are awesome strings i like the sound i like a little heavier sound and i m hoping the high e will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge its always the first to go you cant beat the price on amazon i paid at my music store but i needed strings asap i will order back ups at this price
179	bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot great quality for the money and works well mic is as described it s great to have a few extra mic clips on hand and for the price these are great they hold sm perfectly not cheap or poorly made at all a great value its the exact same thing as my shure mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material thats fine by me they fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should put my schecter c custom fr in drop bb these strings sound great and have a great low end highly reccomend i wasn t expecting much from this case i bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that i had also order off amazon that was of better quality then i had expected this case is sweet i love the black and crome it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth if you need a case don t even think twice about this is a great one at a great price this microphone clip becomes loose at the hinge very quickly and needs to consistently be tightened too much of a hassle really this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle no adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument s size or arrived set for it simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place good value for the price this is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce however the gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger as well as the tail end of the grip because if you have a certain kind of xlr adapter that is wider than the microphone you won t be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the xlr adapter first i use this when myon stage microphone inch gooseneck blackare too long for what i want to do sometimes on rare occasions i have used this to extend the length of the model the mic i mainly use this with is anady dm drum and instrument microphone which is small relatively light and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals when i am using that mic for alto and tenor sax i use anon stage my microphone extension attachment barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand and attach the gooseneck and dm without using a separate mic stand because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile i keep a few of each size around plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars in some situations they can be a savior during set up i will empahsize though that anything larger than the dm or dm which is slightly larger and heavier and this may not hold your mic in place it is what it is works works as expected and should last a really really long time glad i bought it these kind of clips can break but if you re just a little bit careful not to push the microphone in too hard it should last for a long long time i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either a little too small i bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold shure sm and sm however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise these clips are in from front to back in comparison the shure clips are in to in from front to back so the shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand solid heavy base well built does the job of holding a mic no more no less this filter arrived very quickly i use it with a scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should good purchase
180	good deal quite the steal if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal im sure it will be amazing and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal those are pretty crucial to a drumset the pinstripe heads are amazing i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it i love it i used this for my yamaha ypt and it works great i would recommend it to anyone i bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs the same heads i bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven t torn these heads are amazing and a very good investment make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads when i purchased this pedal from a local music store i wasn t even looking for a double pedal set but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my tama stagestar kit during my quest for a pedal that had the feel i wanted i sat behind a pacific drum kit that had these pedals at first i ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi hat i liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when i decided to see what it was like playing double wow it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset most of the adjustments require a hex wrench which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals the left side slave pedal has a full floorplate and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle i have tried there is a slight lag on the left pedal which is normal for any double pedal configuration but you ll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal before i purchased this particular model i tried out tama s iron cobra pearl s powershifter and a gilbralter avenger i did not like the stiffness of the iron cobra but did like the pearl and gibraltar pedals it finally came down to either this or the gibralter which was slightly smoother but significantly more expensive i opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal if you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration i strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look more importantly try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price features and quality it has to feel right in addition you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi hat which means that you will need to compensate for that i recommend the gibraltar hi hat drop clutch asin b f yy which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi hat with ease i have my hi hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position but stepping on the hi hat pedal using the clutch puts it in full play position tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
181	good short cable plugs easy these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables i find the local music stores won t stock them forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about each these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price we will see how well they stand up over the long term as they are a cheaper cable but for the price they are great at per pack you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead if that even happens the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic i can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either the heads are all too large i believe i used these on my gibson les paul custom years ago and they worked perfectly not on my newer sg though at least with the new screws it comes with fender start appears to take the system well only time will tell these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion they play extremely well and last a long time there s nothing better than these strings this was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on it s easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops i recommend it to all aspiring musicians purchased this to replace a behringer pedal because the behringer introduced a swishing sound this pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless good product and got good price here on amazon works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too i live in a dry climate and i have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily since i can t afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing i get anywhere from to weeks out of a pack the time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price on the refillable humidifiers you really can t forget more than a day or two to replenish the water with the humidpak you have a lot more security going on a trip you won t have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners and what a difference i had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them the locking mechanism is great it acts like a vice in a woodshop project and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just don t go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times i bend the strings these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great no complaints on a side note i always clean all my cables with caig deoxit gold g spray contact conditioner oz and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce i also spray a q tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments i love this thing action is perfect great sound good feel easy to play i highly recomend this i bought two sets this is a great why if to keep your strap on your guitar if you still what to keep everything stock great price i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board very flexable and pretty good quality i got this because at just around bucks its pretty much seemed like a stealcompared to other pedals i was looking at but a few notes if you buy this definitely have buy a v adapter with a polarity also know that when people said that little blue light was blinding well they weren t kidding i ve put a little paper and tape over mine as well however it isn t sticking it might not have the best effects or effect strength but as my amp has no built in effects its better than nothing if you re cheap like me but want effects this is decent although the chorus effect seems particularly weak
182	yes you can tweak it so its less but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable when i first installed these strings i wasn t too impressed they felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than i m used to however after a month and a half of playing i really do love these strings i got used to the feel the tinny sound mellowed out a little and man do they stay in tune cobalt strings aren t as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal i find the gain to be more articulate solo s pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing in my opinion they re also super fast i mentioned earlier that they feel different and they do it s not necessarily a bad different it s just slicker and not as coiled feeling hard to describe but if you re used to playing nickle you ll notice the difference honestly my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune i went on vacation for a week came back picked up the guitar expecting to have to tune it and every single note was dead on as they age you ll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickle these really are a good set of strings if you try them just make sure to give them time they get better with wear this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined i would recommend to get a few roles of power grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcros included in most pedal boards and a one meter roll around feet wont last long especially if you have a combination of both regular size mxr or boss and bigger pedals like a cry baby wah or a vox satchurator or time machine reverb or similar you probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals even rare ones so this would be great for you to keep them well attached to your board and properly organized maybe the tape could be made a bit wider perhaps an inch more would be great it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface still a great product concept a must buy this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is size i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me beware because you d figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there given the advertising even the guy at guitar center when i called to find out what was going on told me to go with lute hole i never had a use for such an item before very recently but upon necessity i found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar even if it does fit be very very careful in fact be very very wary as i briefly heard a light cracking noise when i tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the g s specs i ve read elsewhere that it kills your tone but i had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig ultimately i spent nearly more than i wanted to just for this kind of item what is it they say in this era caveat emptor this little box will give it to you i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains i count in my little arsenal with fuzz distorions auto wah a compressor octaver bass booster and a nice di box the mxr eq helps me a great deal to recuperate definition and clarity after this long effect chains that i love a great little box so if you are looking for clarity definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the mxr eq will do the trick cheers warm analog delay very natural sound not sterile at all very ez to use no harsh digital bs i like this way better than the boss plus is is mxr and built like a tank to last a lifetime if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is you think you are finished with your pedal board but in a few weeks you are back at it searching for another effect but this means trial and error and a busy wallet the solution may be this zoom ms g this unit is like having stompboxes to use on demand without having to change out your board here are some the things i like most about this pedal small footprint same size as most single stompboxes of today the digital effects are very very good most have an almost analog quality to them ability to create and save your own patches ordering them for stage use good tuner included i found it to be very accurate and easy to use if you already have a tuner then you can open up another slot great price considering effects this thing costs no more than a single stompboxthe unit is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it however i will say it takes some work to get a handle on everything and the manual isn t a great deal of help but with just a little work and resolve you ll be dialing in some new sounds i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms g zoom has a reputation of creating quality effects units at very reasonable prices they ve done it again with this pedal i highly recommend it if you have one slot on your pedal board but don t know which pedal should fill it one thing to note that was frustrating at first most of the od s and distortion s are preset with the levels way too high for output to a tube amp once you put these pedals in your own patches you can permanently save them with appropriate levels just be prepared to cut the levels down right away when trying out od s and distortions or you will likely get some very unpleasant feedback
183	this thing freaking rocks i love this pedal i can t stop using it sometimes i just play long drawn out chords so i can listen to this amazing tone in combo with distortion on my amp it s perfect metal it does the job it was intended to do before using this i just hooked the strap to the buttons and didn t like it to confined and with the quick release it was more comfortable to use the strap i m glad i purchased this when i did these are a must have item heretofore i ve been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism while it s an innovative system that doesn t require any installation the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things i installed the schallers on my warmoth strat body i found that i needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit not a big deal at all these schallers are exactly what i wanted stars and a no brainer for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup great for a quick practice and really sounds nice wide overdrive and tone range the delay feature is basically a simple slap back echo i d much rather have a chorus in there but for price and the sound i m quite pleased these are a little flubby thick and soft for my taste in guitar picks but they mellow out the tinny sound of my mandolin beautifully the textured grip surface is great this was the easiest tuner i had i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded lol i hadn t played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it having had carpal tunnel surgery a few months ago and having small hands to begin with i started researching guitars with narrow necks the jasmine by takamine kept coming up and had really good reviews so i decided to give it a try buying the s c firstly it was delivered promptly as requested and arrived in pristine condition with some really nice strings it has a lovely honey gold finish on the front of the body which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place i really appreciate the cutaway how many high notes will i be hitting on this baby who knows but it looks way cool lol the craftsmanship at least to my unpracticed eyes looks superb i wasn t too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering on it but finally figured out the lettering was just a sticker that could be easily removed and the sound just lovely with that ringing tonality one would expect from a steel string guitar but with some lovely mellow tones where needed as well i am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is i m taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques hey i don t expect to be a leo kottke or martin simpson anytime soon but i ve got something to shoot for and we all need a dream if you re looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price look no further oh the reason why i only gave it four stars is cuz the neck really doesn t seem to be all that narrow after all but maybe it s just my small kid like hands thumb to little finger i can barely reach an octave on piano and there ya go this has more features than i ll ever likely use has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer appears to be well made bought a takamine years ago it was an exceptional guitar for which i paid adjusted for inflation that would be when i bought this jasmine i got a superb machine for the money simply superb it s not my old takamine but the negative differences are slight and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitar the first is that the finish is not as good the sanding between coats was skimped which means that the finish on the front has some texture the sides of the guitar are also a bit rough the second probably flows from the first the tone is a touch wooden it doesn t sing as the old taka did positives the intonation is true at the twelfth fret and it is playable and enjoyable to play with a slide after the first tune up of the strings it stayed in tune for its price this guitar is a superb introduction to playing a very young child or a small woman will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort for everyone else it should fit pretty comfortably the intonation is true at the twelfth fret and it is playable and enjoyable to play with a slide after the first tune up of the strings it stayed in tune any beginner and more than a few cost sensitive intermediate players will be pleased with this guitar i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan i was going to get the martin backpacker which i have actually seen and held in a store but other reviews sold me on this washburn the case was a particular positive point for me and so was the lower price i am more than please with what i have received the case is great for a traveling soldier rugged and protective with useful pockets the guitar itself is very well made nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument it does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body common to the type as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body and you can t exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic the thing is this guitar is just plain fun it is always handy durable and plays pretty well best buy i have made on a product i couldn t try out first a testament to the quality of the reviews on amazon which have rarely led me astray i ordered this strap to use with both my concert tenor ukes it just works i already owned a ukulele leash type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke s sound hole or tie it off to the head the problem of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body sometimes disastrously with a strap like this one you can completely let go of your uke it stays perfectly in place chord changes strumming become easier when you don t have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow the length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke and uke player sizes it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke the other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way in my case i installed two buttons more convenient and the strap doesn t interfere with my chord hand here are the buttons i used strap buttonsif the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant put your fears aside it can be done quickly easily and the end result is well worth it here s an entertaining how to video that will walk you through it i ve been playing guitar for about years now and i ve always used the kaiser capo but since i got this planet waves one the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case although they re both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort while i can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar less pressure is involved and i kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo that isn t actually barring down the frets is under the guitar instead of over it the product conceals itself well to those who aren t playing the instrument and it has great use i d recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there has a good sound stays in tune wish it came in a darker grain of wood a little bulky my arm goes to sleep sometimes after extended playing wish it was a little thiner i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables this are a great value for your buck the only thing i didn t like about these the cable ties suck haha if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost for the price i paid for this guitar i will be money ahead in two visits to my parents i had it shipped to my parents when i bought it and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits it has much better tone than i expected and very good action stays in tune very well i am very happy with my purchase recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party the d addario exl bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great i ve been a long time fan of d addario strings and these strings did not disappoint they were very easy to string my fender strat with and stayed in tune a good long time the strings had a good feel to them as well where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords you know how you have tuned your guitar and it s tuned as well as it s going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesn t sound right you check the tuning and it s tuned alright but why isn t it sounding right these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords bar chords were terrific too impressive i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat as title says high action inadequate loudness for pickingi compared this to the mitchell md and think the mitchell is very good for it s price you can compare both at guitar center okay i used to tune my guitar online however adding a for this item is worth it it is so accurate and works great so far i saw that some people complaint that the tuner comes without a battery but mine come with one probably it is because i bought it from amazon lt not from some sort of seller in amazon moreover there s also a warranty for this item for those who want to start playing a guitar like me i strongly recommend to get this tuner you won t regret owyea
184	a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar now if i could only play the guitar as well as this cloth cleans it it s a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like i also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me these tuners look and feel great i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build it was kind of a pain having to drill the holes for the prongs on each tuner but that is the way it is designed they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar i chose this rating because a fine paper towel seems to work just as well as this microfiber polish cloth wonderful tuner i ve used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all incredibly easy to use super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go well worth the price lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth it either cleans or it doesn t this cleans polishes all of my guitars great just make sure the strings are off so that this doesn t get caught on them this is a brand i ve come to trust do not use these to polish your guitar it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up a total disaster these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything i don t know what i would do without this little shelf on my music stand i works on my non manhasset sold shelf stand holds my pencil highlighter flute swab even occasionally a small speaker set that i have for my phone it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure very well worth the i used to be that guy that lost about guitar picks a month i bought three of these dunlop pick holders one for each of the three gauges i find myself constantly using and they ve more than paid for themselves in the short time i ve had them purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use distilled water will extend the life of the sponge overall simple and effective however i may have added too much humidity was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity but i then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case i do use a hydrometer but i don t think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar but only the inside of the case so i think the planet waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars i tried this untreated microfiberpolish cloth on my gibson es because i had heard good things about it we ll begin with some stats the cloth is by and has an border stitched aroundthe edge it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea there is a small warning on theback of the package that states not designed for cleaning electrical devices you can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water rinse it out and hang it up to dry now to thereview my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny i have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body s front and back and backof the neck i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off when going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish what i discovered about this cloth even with increased elbow grease is that it has it s limitations so if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out if the body oils have been there for awhile probably collecting dust then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it i decided to use dunlop s dunlop formula guitar polish cleaner to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely since then i have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the planet waves microfiber polish cloth it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid i also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind you want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play i would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything i gave this untreated microfiber cloth stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort my highexpectations based upon the blurb were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around it was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess nonetheless i like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime i will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time i am done playing compared to ernie ball s cloth it s good enough for wiping down things it is soft and non abrasive eb s cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs overall good cloth for general use great price for picks spanning from light heavy picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks for bucks it s a great piece works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it if you are like me my research for a guitar connection to my ipad left me with choosing between the iriffport and the jam i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement here are the reasons why the connector on the iriffport the one that goes into the ipad is not a strong connection at all it feels as though it could disconnect at any time i have a stand to put my ipad on when jamming such that the ipad is in landscape mode so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way with the apogee jam the connector is just like the ipad s connector except it also has the prongs that come out of it securing the connector into the ipad to remove the connector from the ipad you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the prongs go in so it can be removed very very secure i use the gumdrop case on my ipad which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used this flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used important if you have such an ipad case like me i certainly feel that the jam will provide a much more secure connection to your ipad over the iriffport in fact the structure of the iriffport connector was so large that i felt that it did not fit well through my case on the other hand the jam s connector is the same small size as the ipad s original connector this is also something to consider if you intend to use your ipad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the ipad probably the largest reason i prefer the jam over the iriffport you can hear sound directly from the ipad with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward nonetheless with the jam i could attach headphones or external speakers to the ipad if i chose to do so i wanted something that could make my ipad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers with the jam i have this the jam has a gain meter i e an led and a gain control the iriffport does not when not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio the led lets you know if you are connected to the ipad but not to any software blue light or if you are connected to the ipad and to a software application green light there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport i personally like that i can use my own guitar cord with the jam if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device the iriffport uses its own cord and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my normal guitar cable i used with the jam although a fairly minor point it is nice to know that the jam is advertised by apple look at their website and their garageband video and since i have garageband on my ipad i was pleased to see that the advertising material on the jam states specifically that it works with garageband so far i m very pleased with the jam at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good i read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price i usually use dr tite fits but these made me change for good they have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with p s i also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar i built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint for the price of this winder cutter its awesome if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect our teenager really likes these as a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers have not broken one yet it s as good as it looks with that in mind it s perfect it s not very sturdy if you re using it outdoors and it s windy but hey what do you expect from the way it looks all three of my kids have a guitar they were always losing their picks this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks these are good quality strings that will last on your guitar for many months to come probably my second favorite after ernie ball sorry but i m not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers it s okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new and despite claims of being laundry safe the edges began to unravel after the first wash i used with planet waves restore polish and got good results but probably would not buy again you don t really need an expensive sustain pedal unless you re a concert pianist playing on a k keyboard nuff said it serves its purpose doesn t hold as many pick as i expected looking back can t see why i really need it a plastic bag does fine in fact i don t think i ve ever used after the first time i put the picks in it i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag as a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal holy grail of guitar picks i am no exception dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the dollar picks you name it i ve tried it even nail picking on metal strings now if you are new to the perfect pick quest you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your grail different however if you play a light metal string acoustic my main is an aria af tenor guitar check out these dunlops nylons even within the dunlop line i have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same gage didn t acoustically perform quite the same would i try another pick if the chance was presented sure most of us would since the quest for the holy grail never truly ends but until then dunlop s nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection i love this wall hanging mount of course you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud or use drywall backing screws etc but that s just common sense the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described the arms are adjustable stay where you put them this fits my string fender jazz bass as well as my acoustic guitar violin and even holds the neck without touching the pegs if you want it to i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments this is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars
185	excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning well designed and rugged construction i believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least more one button operation makes it simple to operate i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space they work well and i haven t had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises i highly recommend them plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper cords i bought this power supply for in home use i don t do too much gigging or recording so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around the product works very well i m able to power of my pedals easily the cords are plenty long in length however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other i e having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal however that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product i haven t had to use any of the special adapters though but i plan on getting a line dl so having the line adapter is a great added touch best of all all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home i ve been using this product for months now and have no complaints you can t beat the price this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit i m not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable over all i would not recommend this product as background i ve recorded many jazz performances and listen normally to electrostatic speakers and have a pair of electrostatic headphones as well as dynamic models these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise that said they are more difficult to design well as the closed ear cups and back create acoustic interaction with the back of the drivers these headphones have a very open sound smooth midrange excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid and perhaps a bit emphasized bass they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store finally the pricing of these fine headphones are not over inflated as are many high quality products highly recommended
186	always good to have a stationary mic on the floor sometimes it is weet nestled in a drum set or for a singer that might not want to play any instrument but just wants to stand tall went together perfectly and i really wanted it shipping was fast and no problems thanks the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal do i use it yes however i would likely trade it for an mxr or dunlop if i had the opportunity it doesn t sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase while some may like this i want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain as soon as i got this pedal i put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum i have a behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals but my pedal board was silent till i put this pedal on it i ve only had it for a few days but the cons out way the pros maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit once i get around to playing with it i will write another review first off let s get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the dr on the epiphone web site length bout length lower bout thickness lower bout width so now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it the only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the length most bags are you can always opt for the epiphone hard case edread or world tour rwg d or gba the bag i got now that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the review as my title says the guitar reminds me of my samick st which is a very well made spruce top acoustic which is also made in indonesia i have played guitar for over years so i have a collection of over guitars and of them are acoustics but this is the first string and i bought it just to have it around for songs like hotel california etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar i would rarely use i am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under asking price it tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out you constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure the bridge plate on these strings must be huge i found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you don t hit the large one right next to it i have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which i like the nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of that the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out i have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one i have is the later good and transparent compressor with low noise operation very tough construction although not the best it sounds good to me it depends on the situation the sustain is good
187	i actually wasn t aware of this gauge of string until i purchased a guitar from the great george lynch the strings felt different than the s i use on my fenders and the s i use on my gibsons so the next time i saw george i asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me d addario s i love them on my mr scary guitars burnt tiger and that is the only brand gauge of string that i will ever put on that guitar i definitely recommend trying out a set if you want to do swells with your instrument or make notes cry this will do the trick smooth reliable action and no noise too every once in awhile while browsing through amazon i come across something i don t know how i got along without and it really works i love these patch cables they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it i ve ordered about batches of these guys and i would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex the length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes however there are many cables of much lesser value which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown i needed a cheap mic stand that didn t break the bank this little guy fit the bill i don t know if it could stand up next to the hercules stands that i have used for years in terms of long term durability but for a simple home use stand it is perfect it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced great entry level stand
188	this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under seconds i ve even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch pros dead on accurate you can easily set your intonation with this little monster works great in extremely loud environments clips on tightly if you don t jump around like an orangutan on stage you could probably have the snark ride your headstock through the whole show you don t have to plug into it extremely responsive enough display detail for you to know when you re getting close to in tune not just indicators like some tuners flat dead on sharp very inexpensive cons a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass i use the th fret harmonics first partial to tune however since it s a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more so this has never really been a problem for me inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case for every instrument you own works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle i have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes not so this one it is a great reliable tuner this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly even though the title says acoustic guitar case it s obvious that this is a case for a style mandolins i chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo and the reviews were good sure enough the lining is soft and well padded the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect however when closing the case a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly just a slight push pull motion will allow the top to snap in place then everything is as it should be the case fits my a type mandolin perfectly and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around the slight mis fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price i have always loved hercules products their mic stands and guitar stands they are great quality and very handy especially this one for performances where guitars are used bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price i usually use the pro steels by d addario but these sound and fit nicely with my squire fender p bass amazon seems to have great prices and it s nice to have them delivered too these are nice strap locks but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut otherwise these are a good value with easy on off i really like the one handed operation and i really do prefer that the access to it is behind the fret board instead of out front that makes it easier to reach for a quick change and for easy on off i ve been a jim dunlop fan for more than years and this product just reinforces that quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather does exactly what it s says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price it s not fancy but it s well though out and you can t beat the value the edges don t cut your neck and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want like others i had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment the foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want and it flexible thin enough to go through the buckles if needed excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass
189	i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great the arms are adjustable so the instrument won t rest on the pegs the foam is good and the hardware is included plus the price is great we bought this for my daughter s boyfriend we saved it as the last gift to give on christmas day he wrapped the strap around his neck and never put it back down i still don t think it has come out of his hands for more than a few minutes i believe he is very happy with his gift i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments it works better than my piano i can trust that i will be in tune this unit is very small and tucks away nicely it is easy to use i do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well i would recommend this to anyone very nice
190	this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website technical support is also almost zero akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don t buy this product try finding a midi tutorial that is usable good luck with that chore added nov the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts i find that unbelievable the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they won t do magic good luck i play bass in a lot of different environments and i never know what to expect before i show up if i am playing a venue where i can use my head and x combo i know i ll have great tone if i am going direct into the board i am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer this unit gives me the ability to still go direct but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth i suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try i love it it was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin at least it won t fall off soon i just got another mandolin with no button and this strap has no way to attach to it excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well
191	another quality product from hosa just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq i always like slightly longer length as i can always zip tie back but hard to stretch no noise from this cable isn t it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description the product is great value for money and worth while buying if for no other reason than save money on overpriced dc power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit they don t dumb of them as all they needed to say was you needed to buy them separately which i later did seems like nit picking well it s not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me sloppy isn t it perfect for my obscure use i discarded the mic clip or more so added it to my collection and attached a ram mount to the gooseneck now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post what to do with it i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights no more holding a little phone sized thing up to my face for hours on end this stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision i recently sent two of my ovations back to the factory in connecticut for re work i just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them as soon as i took them out of their case and strummed them i immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings i ve ever played what exactly are they i might experiment with the exp s but by and large these exps are my new strings got this to put into my pseudo caster project guitar love it be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model the threads are smaller on these if you like to do dive bombs you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness last important note make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up at the begining i wasn t sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this so i decided to buy it and i started having problems right of the box i notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals then i started to play with them and realized that i had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain so i decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used with my pedals and surprise connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine i also realized that pedals positions routing signal has something to do with it i couldn t figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right so i would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it so it work as it is supposed to i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners and what a difference i had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them the locking mechanism is great it acts like a vice in a woodshop project and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just don t go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times i bend the strings these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune i just got it today and haven t spent too much time with it yet it sounded ok and i like the features on it i especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal as soon as you press down it s on lots of adjustments so i ll be tweaking for a while to find my sound but it seems like it s going to be ok it s a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve for the money it s a great pedal i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals i don t use this on my pedal board and don t know if i would recommend it for heavy live use i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here it does work well and will power many pedals at one time i do not use it for powering only one pedal though this device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals i also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet easy to use it is what it is this multi plug works great and has enough plugs for pedals i only needed it for two pedals which are not in a case so there is some extra plugs hanging on the floor but is better than setting up another wall wart each pedal if needed in the future i have these extra plugs i recommend this multi plug to everyone
192	this plug works very well i like the right angle connectors i have a korg pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals it included a multi plug cable but not a right angle one the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard this works much better this original plug fits the purpose perfectly quality and precision the plugs don t take up space couldn t be smaller and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with make sure what you receive is a one spot product in its original packaging check images reverb effects are no cheap but i was on a budget so i got this particular one the balance between quality and price is good the depth of sound sounds great i love all the options you get with this pedal the package comes with a bunch of stickers which i thought was kind of cool the one spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts get it you won t be sorry arrived on time works as intended and maybe more one day i was pondering how best to de clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various v v dc equipment on my table or rack fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant my problem was solved i chose the v adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary v dc source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack i also bought another similar unit form another source here on amazon and used that to supply the v dc source to power the rest of the units that needed a v source everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage been working without a problem to this day this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power its easy to install and keeps things simple no more extra messy cabling glad i got it thanks to amazon for the quick delivery excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning well designed and rugged construction i believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least more one button operation makes it simple to operate there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today sure some are said to be the best at this or that but for me the rat is the one that does it all and at a great price to boot this pedal is not new to me i ve had a few of them in the past but the rat is just a great as the older vintage models goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer to a near fuzztone with some warm smooth creamy tones in between remarkable no other distortion pedal can do it as well i ve been playing for decades and have had more than my share of them but the rat delivers no joke it just does it all and well the filter tone is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise that might thow a few folks off but it s a little thing really the filter is the core of it s tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little that s great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit the volume won t go through the roof silent switching no hum no buzz and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit flawless comes to mind here easy to set up strong as a tiger tank and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of or knobs for you to mess with and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past kinda cool if you ask me if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues get yourself a rat if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a boo teek pedal that sits in the rat s shadow buy that high dollar unit and you can at least look good while you play but your tone will still stink its up to you me its a no brainer i go with the rat good quality wired correctly can t complain if you use the one spot power adaptor you need to have a couple of these laying around it s probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes in one configuration i only need two plugs in another configuration i need three and yet another configuration i need five so i actually bought a few of the fives and cut them off to the length i need if you own an iphone ipod touch and play guitar or bass you need this one was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this the sound is incredible buy it seriously i bought this pedal mainly for compressing the bass guitar in my home studio it does what it is supposed to i m no master of compression but i get a very usable controlled signal from it i noticed some hum when i turned the level up pretty high and that should be expected i paid less than for this pedal and that should be a factor when you re considering durability of this pedal my bass player uses this pedal going into an svt classic no noticeable hum at concert level yes this pedal is made of high strength plastic if you are an angry stomper go elsewhere this pedal will not survive your overzealous foot battery changing yes it s a pain in the butt two pens are required to push in the hinge pins to release the battery cover the footswitch itself i bought a power supply never looked back so if you are on a budget or not one of the lucky ones with an endorsement deal with a boutique pedal co this should do well for you at the begining i wasn t sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this so i decided to buy it and i started having problems right of the box i notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals then i started to play with them and realized that i had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain so i decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used with my pedals and surprise connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine i also realized that pedals positions routing signal has something to do with it i couldn t figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right so i would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it so it work as it is supposed to i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk imports often have threads other than inch sae it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads quick install works like a dream the tascam dp ex is great i love this little box it s got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop here are a few of the features that i really like about it it s portable and runs on aa batteries it has compression exciter de esser as well as eq and reverb it has a mastering section with effects you can record tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks it feels sturdy not that i would drop it just to name a few i compared this against the fostex mr mkii which i also own and like the tascam has more features for the buck as well it should as it just came out this year and the fostex has been around a while as another reviewer put it this won t replace your daw i can record some very polished songs on my laptop but the tascam does come close the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too i have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience the portability factor is huge in my opinion being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs or vice versa is great plus it s fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas i totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section five stars this bridge is heavily constructed so the amplified sound is much more vibrant and alive it must weigh twice as much as the bridge from my old indiana custom s type guitar i m glad i replaced it now i have a lot more guitar for my money i probably spent total on my fender bridge assembly locking tuners and tex mex pickups as well as the original for my used guitar and i would say i now have the functional equivalent of a fender stratocaster based on sound quality and ease of fingering this was time and money well spent this is the answer to your all your power supply needs if you own more than pedal and we all do you need this it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with plug it comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for pedals it has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain it also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in and it has a foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing you ll save enough money to pay for it in no time not having to buy batteries get it you ll love it i i only have two pedals but that was one outlet spot too many and it really makes a difference when you re onstage with only one power strip now i just wish i had an attachment that would let me charge my laptop and iphone from the same plug as the pedals can t always get what you want i bought these when i had to re tube my marshall jcm kk head this is the only tube head i have played or had so i really cant tell you how they compare to other brands but these things rock they are very good for metal hard rock and have lasted a year now while gigging and practicing weekly i was recommended to jj by a friend who only uses them and i will likely be doing the same i paired them with the jj kt s and these things just rock one spots come with an pedal multi plug if you only have pedals or lets say you have powering them with an plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly the left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren t plugged into pedals using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff great price great purchase completely quite connected with no problem i own two these strings are beyond amazing switching to ernie ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar and if you do any blues playing at all extra slinkies are for you they bend and bend and bend are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos and give a great sound whether you re playing gritty or bright i also play country and punk and these strings let me get enough twang and beef respectively to play those styles as well the best you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put ernie ball strings on your guitar like most of the other danelectro pedals this one has a great sound and in this case a fairly inexpensive price though it is higher than most of their other pedals once again though get the ac dc adapter for it as it ll put you in the poor house supplying v s to it it eats them like candy great picks not just for jazz though i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel but once you do they are fantastic they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them fair priced and i love the color of the green ones i like the mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard great for someone looking to play blues or rock cheap and easy to use can t beat these picks you can set up delays configurations what is a interesting option to use on stage tap function also helps a lot all type of delays are sounds beatiful this multi plug works great and has enough plugs for pedals i only needed it for two pedals which are not in a case so there is some extra plugs hanging on the floor but is better than setting up another wall wart each pedal if needed in the future i have these extra plugs i recommend this multi plug to everyone havent used this one yet i got it to run to my pedal board for those stages where the backline is not easily accessible seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general
193	every guitar i ve ever cared about has had this strap on it i must ve bought about of these over my lifetime and i don t regret it even in the slightest as a guitarist who s had the opportunity to work at guitar center back in trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task while i ll chose d addario exl s for electric martin sp are my top choice for acoustic the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them granted that s only aesthetic works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks i d use it for lightweight guitars using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage this strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage great picks buy it this pick rocks for me im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing
194	just arrived in good shape polish w an expansive polishing cloth almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths this is a great winder steel shaft will probably last one of these should come standard issue with every guitar i plugged in the amp and i plugged in the bass and there were no issues with the wire this is one of those products you don t want to overly notice and in that it has done the job is is designed for these exl gauge d addarios are good strings at a good price they sound nice and bright on my epiphone sheraton ii and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale which i like i d rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time the strings don t break either i have limited experience with these types of product but it does get finger grime off quite well and does not leave streaks like another guitar brand name product i also have the cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth just feels right for the job the fact of the price for this and the cent shipping is pretty damn good because i have silverstone ss s and a stratocaster and i took parts of of one ss to fix the other then i bought these strings for it fixed it up and now that guitar sounds better and less buzzy than the strat also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase i lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and really cheap shipping i will buy more later to fix my other guitar when i get the bridge nuts replaced
195	nice cables so far i ve not had any problems with them but haven t put them through a lot of use just yet also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more i ll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other have to try them more and with other amps by now they work really good and no interference where detected at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot these are the second planet waves cables that i own and the first ones are still in great conditions this light is exactly what i needed very bright and great battery life and it comes with power cord unlike some others where the cord is more we are an acoustic duo and play out on a lot of decks at bars and restaurants and this is perfect lights the music book nicely a definite must have works great with my fender super champ x amplifier however it does not come with a cable i would highly recommend really wanted to like this one because i loved the price there is no way this is true bypass the one i got was defective out of the box and so when i checked i saw the circuitry did not support pass through maybe it is because i received a defective one but i still wouldn t try this brand name i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something look no further you will not be let down by the build quality of these cables nor by the sound quality i have a monster m rock cable put up against these i fail to distinguish the difference in sound the only difference price these cables are the only cable i will ever use from now on go ahead buy them you will love them without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my pedal guitar effect lineup no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing clean quiet good buy for the price as other reviewers have noted the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to click into the jack of your guitar or amp easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about then the cable is fine other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends it really nice made in canada not china wow that alone impressed me like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material yes you can bend it it will probably last life times ends are made of leather one advantage is that once you set it to the appropriate length it will not change easily if your switching to different size guitars this could be a problem cause you can t make an on the fly quick adjustment on stage you will be wrestling with it i ve only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic i wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions jams rehearsals and gigs but i also wanted the option of just capturing a line source such as from the di on my bass amp bingo toss in the dual mode overdub phantom power ability to run off usb power and it is a total winner in my book when you select the recording format and encoding or resolution wav bit and resolution mp bit rate etc each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card i also love that it uses full size sd cards microsd can be used with an adapter of course they re much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinky nail sized micros i ll update this review after i ve had some more time with it been using these cables for three months now i use them with azoom g n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research i found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time they have a good lenght of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you ll be playing so far i ve only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig i ve got coming up the end of the month the tuners i have for my guitar banjo have modes for use as a metronome the problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome i find them annoying this metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial the speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed and there are two clicks to choose from the metronome has a flashing light too overall a very useable metronome stars these strings have made me a d addario customer for life the sound and feel are perfect and i find that they last much longer than more expensive coated strings i have no desire to buy any other brand these strings are not over hyped these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable i wish i d gotten one longer than feet though since i can only play close to my amp with two five footers oh well this mike is an awesome value you could pay twice or three times more and the frequency response is excellent service was super fast i would ve no problem buying from these folks again in the future
196	i read a lot of positive reviews on the s and after some use i am kind of disappointed construction they are just like any other strings just lighter gaugepackaging it arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionprice at new with free day shipping this is a no brainer conclusion i initially liked the feel of these strings but the more i played the more i realized that it didnt have the tone i was looking for i am used to s and s and though they are more difficult to bend with they sound much fuller i put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with s works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well i ve tried other passive volume pedals that didn t work this one works worth every penny there really is nothing not to like about this pedal a band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than most b then drive goes from clean to solid overdrive c level control provide from ve to high ve boost with drive set to pm and level at pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior really nice roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volume highly recommended i bought these d addario strings after going back and forth between s and s and have really come to like these sizes they keep a nice slinky feel and keep a lot of tone through many hours of playing i m really happy with this d addario purchase
197	this daisy chain worked very well for me no problems yet i m powering about six pedals currently and i am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound i think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank and it should work with any single spot a c adapter you might already have so no need to buy another the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years the shell and the lining of the case are perfect hard on the outside and soft on the inside i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in the only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen i m not traveling around with my guitar too much so that s not a problem for me but i would worry a bit if i were checking it on an airline otherwise it works perfectly for what i bought it for protecting it in my mancave basement from dings and scratches i usually use the pro steels by d addario but these sound and fit nicely with my squire fender p bass amazon seems to have great prices and it s nice to have them delivered too i bought one of these for a friend of mine and he said it was the best thing he d ever used to keep his picks out where he can readily get to them i bought two more today this is one of the best simple to use guitar tuners i ve used and i ve used a lot of them the bonus is that it s also one of the least expensive that i ve seen you won t be disappointed the best eb slinky s i ve ever used on these i use the light s s even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well i use them on all of my guitar s two fender american standard s gibson es gibson les paul with bigsby i always have a set in each case try um ya won t regret it this product works well but i still end up doing it the old fashion way guess i am not a gimmick person a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good sound quality is great i also have the very first jamman with the add on button footswitch i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this don t expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though in a band setting your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record stop and playback slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer i had that one first and it is horrible to use sold it i am happy with it and use it live in a and piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when i am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages excellent quality it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those find a youtube video to see all of its potential best looper for the money strings i use d addario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great they have a really nice sound and don t cost an arm and a leg this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for it sounded brilliant while it wasn t broken for about the hours of runtime it works if it isn t abused at all but if you abuse it in any way at all your out an xlr cable i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage so these are heavy strings that work well i did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough
198	it works and it works well it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc no damage to blades when cutting heavy to light gauge steel strings if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have it is very durable the material is made of high quality metal and it makes clean cuts the rubber grips are comfortable to use and have red accents and therefore easy to find my only minor gripe is that it is spring loaded to open i ve cut myself with the blades reaching into the pocket a few times when i first got it thankfully i don t change strings too often i also made a little leather pouch for the clipper end and i put a rubber band around the handles to keep it closed a must have for your guitar bass ukulele bag highly recommended honestly the strings are great they sound great and they are relatively inexpensive for bass strings i love them and they will be what i buy the next time i change out as well highly recommended works just fine except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels not sure what that s about but i m not very picky and know nothing about guitar stands so maybe it s supposed to i ve use these strings for years i play often and like to change strings often i can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs they hold tune very we at least on my guitar indoors and out i d highly recommend them my guitar originally came with d addrio exp and they sounded good i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good but the finish was wearing fast this time i got a pack of ej d light the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly but the sound is the problem it s terrible they sound very muddy crisp tone distinction is just not there i thought light would be the better route but now i m not sure i purchased some others to try also since a purchased a pack i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings when i was searching for midi cables for my art x foot controller i came across these hosa ones and they were dollars each as they are now i realize i would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly you must realize that they are only feet as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect i love the dunlop formula polish and cleaner it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism i ve used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles this one works almost like a mist it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints i spray it directly on the surface of the guitar and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth after i m done the shine looks glassy and great only issue they break easily but they last a long time and sound great well worth the money crisp and fresh tone for a long time i may be a guitar newbie but as far as i can tell this capo is not a fake o piece of crapo these sound great and last a long time for me plus they re reasonably priced put em in your case and don t be unprepared i like squirrels i love this little tuner it s better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar and as accurate and easier to use than the one on my vox tonelab st i m planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case i bought the mm picks i would consider them medium thickness if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness the mm is right for me i really like them i m going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light while the packaging sealed for each set is a good thing and also the individual color coding of each string i do prefer martins it is fine strings i couldn t really find difference between martin m maybe its just me i expected more than that its just regular strings it s a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost the fact that it looks like it s made out of bat armor is a huge plus for a clip on you can t beat the accuracy this little unit gives you all my guitars use this quick release clip its so easy to install and sturdy material it wont break easily even after many uses have one now this onstage heavy duty guitar stand is exactly what we were looking for to hold my son s acoustic guitar here are my observations easy to setup takes just a few seconds sturdy free standing design works well neck retainer adds a degree of protection from accidental knocksthis is a great basic stand that works exactly like we hoped highly recommended cfh i bought a pedaltrain pedal board and i have individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it i originally bought hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile but the selection of lengths is limited i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re do the board i swear i was done in minutes the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality the supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small tip flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step i could have saved some money if i had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn t work whereas this does the job i m happy i purchased this and didn t have to invest in purchasing v batteries every time i wanted to play guitar makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one arrived quick and before scheduled these work perfect for my needs this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle no adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument s size or arrived set for it simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place good value for the price i love this little item i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it no more hunting for picks anymore when i am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it s always there when i pick up the guitar placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar i placed mine where i d never rub against it between the amp cord inlet and a control knob make sure it isn t in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it i love this and have one coming for my acoustic too only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar oh i use medium picks and fit easily into the holder and wouldn t try to squeeze another on in but that s why you have a gig bag anyway this is a must have item in my opinion play very mello easy on my fingers too can t come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on my taylor acoustic better than dunlop polish it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine mine didn t come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though just recieved my stand it fits the mandolin perfect it also fits my wifes ukelele so i ordered a second one this morning its made very well is compact once its folded up the price was awesome i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment thank you so much i tried these strings on my zager guitar the are certainly ok and play fine they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager just a little cheaper in cost perhaps maybe they will last longer i had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity i put in there for the guitar wood i live in hot and very dry arizona these have not rusted so far nice picks a bit small for my preference great for picking kind of harsh for strumming quality seems top notch some guitarists will love these although the quality is obviously not that of a studio this guy serves it s purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it i use it when i mess around in garageband and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment it s also very easy to use and the usb cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus using the string cleaner on a regular basis helps to prolong string life and keeps your guitar sounding bright and full a repeat buy i bought it just so i could learn a little bit of guitar it sounds good and looks really nice i get compliments on it i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price the best strings i ever bought and i ve bought them all i got these for my electric and the ej p acoustic electric for my acoustic they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy i have used all kinds of strings these are what i use on a regular basis they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive most of all they are cheap what a great little gizmo i play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me no more unplugging plugging in between songs just a push on the pedal and i m switching noiselessly between guitars i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well bought this for my son its perfect for practice great portability has a nice clean sound as well as a decent overdrive sound sounds great with an electric acoustic its surprisingly loud for a small amp you can t beat the price i highly recommend this a year ago i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r wave mp recorder blackand thezoom h handy recorder gb accessory kit pre accessory kit i wanted a high quality easy to use recorder so even though the h had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use zoom has responded with the h a scaled down version of the h with all of the features of the r and all of the controls right where you need them the h even has additional features over the r but they don t get in the way for example there s a choice of a degree recording pattern a degree recording pattern and even a surround sound option samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website one big complaint i ve had with the edirol is the cost of its add on stand unlike the edirol the h comes with a simple stand in addition the h has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod on a separate note it s much easier to replace batteries with the h than the edirol recently i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r and the zoom h i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness the first time we played them back i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units the second time we played them back my preference was for the h with overall opinion continuing to be split we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all i do prefer the edirol s control buttons to the h s membrane and i m not about to sell the edirol perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and don t want to give it up just yet also the edirol r is the darling of the moment however if i owned neither i couldn t justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h and would opt for the h when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i d need only one recorder i grabbed the h i have k k pickups in other guitars this is the first one i ve bought that had the smaller transducers it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers like other k k pickups it sounds darned good with a decent pa head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking the pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack this one comes with an ingenious diy installation jig made from i m not kidding cardboard golf tees and double sided tape it makes placement a snap the best pickup is still an external mic but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer you can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup i put these strings on every acoustic i own they sound great and are priced right you can t go wrong with d addario strings i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use however it broke not too long after i bought it one of the connections broke that is i think they might have made it a little more durable since then moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool it would be nice though not to have had to do that if you buy the keyboard you re going to need the power adaptor sucks that yamaha runs this scam of not supplying the power cord and making you buy it separate but i suppose the nickle and dimes really add up for them power cord fine yamaha shady i put this in a guitar i have a recording king rd that sounds so good that i wanted to use it for live gigs so i popped in this k k i ran it through my swr california blonde ii acoustic amp if you have been wanting an acoustic guitar to have that miked when you plug it in this is as close as it gets i recommend getting a sound hole cover if you play with a band but you will not be disappointed the installation can be a little tricky but with a little patience and reading anybody can install it if you don t feel comfortable just go pay a local luthier to install it for or ask your grandmother for help p for me this stand is very well built not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price they don t touch the floor there are safety straps that hold my acoustic guitars fender ibanez and my anybody s guess antique in place without any difficulty so i don t have to worry about knocking them off or over it takes up very little space the biggest plus really helpful both in live gigs and at home great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand i put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far no dead cables yet i ve been using them for months or so i enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars easy to install and remove stars to the seller and the strap itself got what i needed a basic capo for a good price the tension is a little tighter than i d like but works for me covers all strings and depresses them fully i don t use it often so i can t speak to its longevity but good for me good unit for the money for sure it is not road worthy however in our opinion still for any smaller gigs it does a fine job delivery packaging etc were very good good sized holder i placed it between the tuners it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time just enough tension to hold the picks not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them highly recommended good strings i love these strings i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these i really enjoyed them after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase no desire to test other strings especially after this bundle value these seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which i will appreciate for a long while rock on i m going to be honest i have a cheap guitar i payed for an epiphone at my local music store because i just play it recreationally bonfires sitting around the house etc so i ve never really put a nice set of strings on it because i figured strings aren t really going to make that much of a sound difference on this guitar but i was way way way wrong these strings aren t even that expensive actually they re only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings i put on my guitar yet they completely changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like i forked over some money for a decent guitar the strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips i used to play once or twice a week but i can t help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing got a new tenor uke and couldn t resist putting my fav strings on it replaced ghs strings so far so good i gave these strings a try but i don t care for them that much i have always used sp s or elixir s and i don t think that will change after trying these installed one on my cf martin almost leaving a thumb super glued to the inside of the guitar an interesting experience would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar i m sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar bought another for my brand new taylor gs mini mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the cf martin through a brand new kustom sienna pro acoustic guitar amp from amazon i ve read that folks prefer the k k over the made for the gs mini taylor pickup get it for what it s supposed to do it works very well i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think this is still usable but it is for very big fingers i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there but this still leaves some extra room either way it works well it feels very sturdy and i m not worried about it cracking anytime soon for the price it s a must have the small e string and the g string both broke on the ball end while tuning i haven t broke a string while tuning in years never ever had one break on the ball end luckily i bought the three pack but i can t recommend this product this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great it alows you to fine tune each string buy it this is a great guitar for the money i paid for my guitar and bought it through amazon com from streamline audio video it arrived ahead of schedule in great shape ready to play right out of the box after tuning it of course if you want a better guitar than this you will need to spend a whole lot more the sound is great and it is easy to play only about long and may weigh a bit over the lbs stated in the description my strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what i will need works great keeps all my fretboards looking great even though i change strings frequently on my twelve acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever i play hard for several hours almost every day and i m always amazed at the crud that accumulates on the fretboards guess i ll have to stop eating cheetos while i m playing just kidding this oil breaks down the crud and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition no issues no problems only positive things to say about the oil it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar these went on with no problems they have a brassy sound to them since purchasing them they still ring nicely my favorite string from back in the s when i had my own guitar shop great strings and the best packaging i had been using s on my s takamine and they were over powering the chassis with vibration the result was poor sound switching to these s made a huge difference in tone it took a bit to get used to the lightness but now i will stick with them on this guitar they are also easy to do bends which i like alot i have never broke a d addario acoustic string i started using the confetti picks years ago when i used to occasionally drop my pick no matter what color the floor carpet stage is you can find your pick easily no lost picks i like the extra heavy picks they suit my playing style well i don t have to wait for it to snap back it doesn t bend they don t break either although they do wear down over time kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping when i buy a gross i only need to buy picks about once every years i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping i had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s im gonna by me one lol ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists i ve been playing for about years now and have used many different brands an types of pick there is no perfect pick for everything depending on what your playing and your playing style you ll want to choose different thickness and materials however i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor i also really like the nylon material it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar i like the playability of the mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues i keep a stack of mm for a more raw folk like sound in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be i ve tried every standard pick even bone silver really expensive ones these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite and they re cheap great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin they are small which takes getting used to though play with the round side for a fat tone play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone d addario what s up these didn t last long at all i don t play my martin very often too busy with electrics but these were trashed in a month guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now never purchase again i ve relied on this stuff for years and it has yet to let me down i play my guitars quite frequently and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat etc during a show a couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self with zero degradation to the finish i ve even used this on matte or light finishes with good results tip a little goes a long way i play every week i use this stuff every time i put away a guitar and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle i figure this stuff costs me about cents per month it s cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well i would recommend this if not this one at least buy some kind of cleaner polish protect your investment i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick it s not a bad pick i will continue to use them but i wish they had a softer center or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers received in just a few days to a beginner like me they like like good strings but what do i know i see mixed reviews here at this price no telling what the quality control is like but as i wrote in another review on this type of item you can buy of these and if one fails you re still ahead of the game they re so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store well worth taking a chance mine seems to be fine doesn t look or feel flimsy at all i can t see any difference between this and what i buy in a retail package i love the strings so far just put them on my jasmine by takamine guitar today and they sound amazing very bright tone i will be using d addario strings from now on very pleased with them i have used d addario ej pb lights for years i find them hard to beat for quality and sound and will continue to use them on all my guitars i like cool gadgets and this is no exception the red color is a metallic color and i totally dig it the display is nice and bright as well super accurate tuning well worth it for the price
199	just the perfect pick i was looking for i ve tried experimenting with several types of picks finally found the right one not much to say about a basic bag it fits a dreadnaught acoustic string guitar has good padding and has a large front pouch for music and small fairly flat items like a tuner winder or spare strings has a carry handle strap but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have seems well made first of all i liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief it sounds ok for the price this mute allows me to practice without annoying my family and does not harm the violin it seems well made my strat has bigger frets than any guitar i have ever owned and i have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges particularly on the rd string this to set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure while still feeling faster than an acoustic guitar they sound great last a long time stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets the build quality could be better ideally the nut needs to be replaced the cut is a rush job and the neck needs to be reset there s a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn t completely cleaned out when it was put on but what do you expect for this price it is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you re willing to invest another or so it can be a great starter guitar for a young smaller player or a nice travel instrument i bought this because my band s primary pa mixer doesn t have high impedance inputs for a guitar pickup and i don t always want to bring my submixer for quick change gigs so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution the pdc is a no frills device it converts a instrument cable high z to a balanced unbalanced or xlr low z signal it does a fine job i don t notice it coloring the sound i e it s not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted although it does lower the volume somewhat that s to be expected in a passive di box and it doesn t bother me i m using it with an lr baggs m a active soundhole pickup the m a spits out a fairly hot signal and i don t have any problem with the signal loss associated with the pdc if i were using a passive pickup in my guitar the results might be different bottom line it s small fairly light seems durable and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the xlr inputs our pa mixer requires it does everything i wanted and the price was right i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume numerous reviews posted on amazon sweetwater sound and musician s friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark this is w mini pa that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully if you have a quality mic there are package sets with this amp by other sellers on amazon that bundle cables and mics et cetera recommend steering away from that and just buying the amp from amazon and getting a shure sm or other quality mic seperately many reviews talk about the durability and how easy the amp is to ding and scratch cosmetically i see potential for that too thus the need for a carry bag mentioned below but i don t see this as a big downer and i personally don t mind if it takes on a road worn appeareance after bumping it a few times if appearance is your thing shell out the extra and buy a roland or fender shop around click around if you buy items sold from amazon you can depend on free shipping if you buy from sellers through amazon you will usually pay shipping and the overall pricetag will be bigger and as i ve stated on other reviews other sellers that sell through amazon sometimes ship slower or make mistakes with shipping so know that going in on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for to got it to my door for i really can t say enough about the ease of shopping trustworthiness and quick delivery of items sold by amazon stars just for service the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better you probably won t be able to find a carry case that fits this amp but i bought the singer black universal sewing machine tote for just over and it s perfect it fits the mini snugly with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals with my current setup i can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands and that s really neat the closest amp case would be x combo case that won t fit right and would take away from the whole portability thing you re not going to find lbs and worth of quality amp anywhere else when compared to other makers fender roland nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets and i understand why recommend without hesitation and as with all my reviews if something goes wrong down the road i ll edit the review to share but i expect that this amp will meet my needs for a long time to come i love these picks great for lead playing and with small fingers like i have they feel great nice quality pick i am self taught guitar for about months without this i would be lost i work with a guy who has played guitar for years he tunes it to itself when i had him try my tuner he found that his guitar was tuned to itself yet so far off for you cant beat this don t be so cheap buy this and enjoy it these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch the soundis full and fills the room
200	this is just what the doctor ordered i bought three and am purchasing more all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders if i switch one mic to another stand it could not be easier just a press of a little button with different shock mounts on different mics i don t have to worry about re threading the mounts each time i change mic stands the time it saves is also invaluable no problem with quality control on the i now have and i have no complaint with the build great for the studio where i use mine would think it would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand use a clip for that addendum i love these so much i have bought one for each mic in my locker and each stand that s a total of none of them have failed after almost a years worth of use the best invention for a mic since the shock mount these will save you time guaranteed digital drumset electronic guitar microphone non xlr and a keyboard i got the brady bunch musical here this mixer works great no complaints just works all connections are mono works great appears to be well made good connectors twenty five foot allows a great deal of movement good value it didn t naturally fit onto my blue yeti mic which is weird since this is a blue mic and its supposedly universal but whatever i made it work for more dollars instead of the meshy pop filter you could have this one which looks and feels like it ll last a looong time if the pop filter fit on right i would have gave stars x im starting a podcast i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this great for voice overs in sound proof studios the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise the ability to select the recording modes is great if youll use it i would not reccomend recording people at once on this however recording a choir or something would work but i will never do that and neither will you this microphone only has a usb port not xlr so no hope of expanding if you ever want to host a podcast with people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and new microphones or you can do what i did and get audio technica atr s behringer xenyx dual mic input mixer shock mount broadcast boom combos and windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand now i can replace my mixer and keep my mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for hosts on my podcast do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever
201	nice works and no problem sound is good packaging is good so far the so good used for almost a month now well like everyone knows this is the copy of the boss but a lot cheaper than that it works just fine and i m happy with it anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal if you want more from a pedal the boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance i was not happy with the sound of these strings the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny for an extra i bought the d addario ej pro arte and got a much much higher quality sound out of my yr old yamaha g spend the extra its well worth it i ve used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect very easy to grip and last long one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind highly recommand this for anyone needs pick the honeytone is aptly named it has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size that reputation is earned it has double the volume of a portable amp i own that s twice its size the tone range is generous from mellow to high treble from what i ve seen and heard the overdrive function is fairly useless in an amp this size it tends to go distortion to the point of garble my guess is specific guitars may work well with the overdrive but i have no use for it as i prefer clear tones it is possible to over volume the amp as with any amp so i don t max it out but for a portable or practice amp it works very well i ve bought three of these now and plan to buy more i don t know as i d pay to for it but the amazon price currently around makes it a great value i hope it s around at this price level for a long time as it s great for hobbyist projects or for box guitar amping
202	i am impressed at the thought that was put into the design of this product i bought one for my daughter and one for me great deal for a great product i ordered two of these based on the review and indeed this guitar strap deserves stars it feel like leather but i am not it is true leather however at a piece i have to give it stars i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs i will order two more i have different kind of guitars acoustic classical electric and bass it fit all of them but i keep thinking it is going to interfere with tuning at the nutwill be trying to get more use in it can hold the weight of any of my guitars its easy to install and i guess its cheap it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin do they sound as good as a k gibson f not hardly do they sound good for a dollar chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find actually yeah they do this is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so i wouldn t worry about that when you get it the action is likely to be high and if you can t lower the bridge enough with the wheels it s easy enough to sand some off the bottom also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something decent strings don t cost very much depending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable after you fix the bridge and strings little instrument the hardware isn t the best and the tuners suck but hey if you re just starting out tuning is part of the game for and i ve seen new ones bucks less from time to time it s worth the investment you can spend more on dinner and a movie and after you ate and watched the flick it s gone with the money spent here you ll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening my year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it so far so good it s been holding up well btw if breaks you and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin been there since you re here reading this that means you re on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going after that you can find many good books cds dvds that will help you along even further and one day you ll get a better instrument i m actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so i don t take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever and if i get cold and run out of wood these are almost cheap enough to burn one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these if you go to certain online classifieds cl coughcoughcough you ll notice people ask bucks or more for these sometimes over used same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new this is one of the few cases where i d buy new over used if you decide to sell it and as long as it s not in pieces it ll still bring bucks used so you won t be out much but really it s a good servicable instrument with a little work but if you re lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it again though not that big a deal to fix if it s not oh as stated elsewhere these don t have trussrods that s not bad in itself you d be surprised how many mandolins didn t have them years ago and alot of them are still around even from some big makers if the neck warps in a year or two no big deal you got your moneys worth mines been kicking around for awhile and the last year a year old at the time has been beating on it and i can still pick it up tune it and play it
203	sturdy stand this is not my first guitar nor am i breathless epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of taylors and martins it s not here s what it is an exceedingly well constucted amazingly playable guitar fit finish feel and action were all very nice sound on the other hand let s face it it s plywood all around it sounds like plywood but that doesn t distract from the fact that it s a great guitar for bucks it s a fine first guitar it s a great beach camping cabin guitar leave it in your car to practice at lunch leave it in the office any guitar is better than no guitar and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box new premium strings do make a difference if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you won t be disappointed if sound quality is your primary concern well you are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy for my desired application this guitar was great i m very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat been using the snark tuners for while now functions perfectly only problem i have is it is small enough that i have trouble finding it sometime so i have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same i use this pedal mainly for the church setting in ambient volume swells it has seven different reverbs you can choose from including reverse so it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for it is ruggedly built and digital which some will like and others won t i like it that said i have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well they sound good and are affordable works great for changing guitar strings good build and doesn t look cheap built in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too first off i m no ukulele expert that being said i replaced the original strings on my newmahalo u pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pinkwith these i know they stated concert however reading up on this they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke immediately i noticed a difference in sound on these strings like another reviewer said it s not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke but it sure helped out a lot the sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well i m loving the sound also i really like the way they look on my pink uke it s a nice touch i would definitely recommend these i do question the leather part but since it doesn t say what kind of leather i suppose thats fine its still a good strap either way this amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers and name on an old card and give guitar picks at the same time the edges are a little rough but it is a punch not a precision cutter one of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed
204	i have had a korg ca tuner for a few years which i really like i wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit initially i bought a boss tu for more money but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the korg tm and the batteries rattled around in their compartment also i like having the middle green led for tuning the price here can t be beat and it s a well built item that works great i was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much but they take more pressure that it would seem and there is a delay until it turns on or off so that turned out not to be an issue i am not real hot for the color but it s nicely made and works well so i will live with it i especially like the little folding stand in the back rather than having to find an old credit card i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar and will soon replace them on quality control the high e steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it two of which show after stringing the guitar string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad on sound these seemed okay at first but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week especially the high b and e steel strings which just don t sound that good to me and i find the low e wound string notes tend to be too high as i move up the neck more so than other sets i have used guess i ll go back to d addario and ernie ball best strings ever strung these up on a seagull guitar to replace some strings that were several years old and the gauge and action of the guitar killed my fingers so it didn t get played much these strings feel great and sound fantastic very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows nothing sounds as bright as these strings i ve tried many and these are the best by far i know cause i play em geetar real good like this is hands down the best tuner i ve ever owned the snark sn works extremely well and being chromatic works on every stringed instrument i own guitar bass banjo violin no matter what key the instrument is tuned to i still use my korg pitchblack inline with my bass also a very nice product but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong this little baby is amazingly easy to use and always accurate it has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle just as it should be i ve personally always hated those boss pedal tuners it simply does its job and does it very well also buying this item from amazon saved me quite a bit over the local guitar center which is always a big plus it feels tough too this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around which is a very good thing despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping the product arrived intact and fast i would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition no thanks to that paper envelope seriously they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something i could not be happier at least until i buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag
205	if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed sounds weak sounds old sounds worn sounds dull i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster i can afford to pay twice as much but i am going to keep using my d adario strings from now on i am so disappointed these strings are for the campfire guitarist not the aggressive picking thrilling tapping pull offs or sweepers if you are a tone fanatic keep looking if your guitar deserves the best do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings respect your guitar i wouldn t be surprised if they are made from china i just had a guitar setup with dr pure blues s and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff i ve also noticed a bit of what i must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so it almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as black as the oxidation i ve seen from low quality strings they also seem to have more string squeak when changing chords than other brands even after generously spritzing them withfingerease guitar string lubricanti am not qualified to say if they truly give you that vintage tone but they do sound decent however for i would rather getdean markley blue steel lt electric guitar strings or save some money and go withd addario exl electric guitar strings super light evenernie ball super slinky string set seem to feel better to me but i am a da dairy o man for now what can i say that has not been said about the other drs that i have used they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues i decided to use s on my fender tele hollow body because the company puts s on their guitars i didn t want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so i stuckwith the s hey the rev uses s size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone the other reason for the pure nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from p pick ups pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit one more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets which is a good thing steel will wear down your frets a lot faster i will say that my very first set of dr pure blues went bad after a few weeks the windings brokeon the d string at two places where the string fretted the reason i kept going back to dr bluesis that i have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars solid bodies another hollow body since then giving dr a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in was a fluke if you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with dr pure blues allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone this is because prior to the mid smost strings were made of nickel during wwii nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings or so the historical theory goes gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound to achieve the vintage tone i am sure you would alsoneed the right amp and the right touch to get to that point i am not necessarily looking for a vintage tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last your exact mileagemay differ i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board there is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much i wipethe fret board definitely not the strings though i have also never heard any string squeak from thestrings that would give me pause either any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high or the nut is not cut right or the wrong sizestring is used for the nut well there you go what i have experienced with dr pure blues nickel wrap round core strings i willalso say that on guitar forums that i frequent more people are giving dr kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings so if you do get a bum string give them a holler now get out thereand play your heart out oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it have fun i thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret i bought these through amazon about a year ago and have installed them on all of my guitars i have both the nickel and black on heavy basses and they have never let me down i have since installed them on an electric and acoustic guitar out of convenience and purpose the locks work great and give you an added sense of security the reviews of the locks speak for themselves and no matter what style of guitar whether it s a les paul strat or active bass i would strongly suggest them i have never used the dunlop locks but have heard that some epiphone and gibson les pauls have mounting holes more suited for dunlops one thing to note is that all of these come with their own longer screws to use if needed i never had to use them but they are a nice touch and ended up in the parts bin
206	string changes usually take me to minutes each but i restrung all of my guitars in less than minutes one is a floating tremolo the spanner is smooth the cutter is strangely very clean cutting usually use electrician wire dykes and the pin puller is nothing fancy but does the trick quickly awesome little tool and very impressed with it a on every function would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands but other than that it s perfectly perfect very highly recommend does what it says i live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do this is obviously higher quality well made a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one i started playing mandolin back in september and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing and finally decided on the dunlop jazz stubby mm picks once i determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that i won t ever be without one picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most buying them in bulk this way means that i ll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises to start with i didn t buy this guitar because it was cheap but because of the unbelievable reviews i don t know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past i have owned and sold my gretch my yamaha my ovation but i won t be selling this one i ve had it for months now and haven t adjusted anything only played this string from american musical supply amazon it is the best playing best sounding string i have ever played period this guitar set off a couple of other epiphone purchases one for my son aj sce s and es also great guitars most of my life epiphones were dull over coated junk not anymore and it seems that epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them i own gibson studio les paul sg american strat martin d washburn rogue all nice guitars most for a lot more money this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value american musical supply is also great the first aj sce came in with a bad neck and ams emailed a return fedex lable in an hour and after i dropped it off and it was logged in at a ups outlet around the corner i got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way when it arrived days later it was a good one star service this pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter it is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile i have many acoustic guitars and i use this on all of them to keep them looking good easy to use wipe on and wipe off normally i prefer a harder pick but i switch to these after pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors these super light flexible nylon picks are great if you re trying to play quietly if you prefer a flexible softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick impressed with this set i installed them today and have been playing for a few hours my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree im not sure if they are supposed to be flush and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out i think my guitars tone has improved a little too but i also installed new strings qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins this is a really nice microphone it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price i would buy this again
207	it works really well and it s really thin it s thinner than i thought the price it s about right i needed only of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this they work well but they are not mogami that being said i use them in my rig and bought some for my brothers we both seem pretty happy with it i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp it works really well having the two different style of ends gives you good options when putting a system together hands down the best cable i have ever owned i was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now i spend that money on other stuff i play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for or months well worth the money lifetime guarantee to boot definitely will buy mogami from now on defiantly a space saver i can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables it s very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits my only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much this is one of the best pedals i have on my board i originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this i was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect which can be breathtaking the settings are all quite useful church plate spring hall room gate etc and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay there is also a toneprint setting which is nice but honestly the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound the toneprint seems redundant i leave this pedal on most of the time along with my corona chorus and flashback delay it is part of my sound i have some neurological problems with my picking hand and can t seem to hold onto picks i really like these max grips a lot and have found that they are excellent for soloing great tone as well for my tastes they are are a bit stiff for strumming but perfect for everything else i love the size and wouldn t want anything larger the advantage of these over the dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip you can still pick with them the davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic as i ve been on an electric fixation lately also a fan of the regular jazz iiis and find they don t slip as much as my dunlop tortex picks i think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering still in terms of grip they don t hold a candle to the max grips both picks have their own unique tonal character i ve tried a variety of picks and i think that once you get used to smaller picks you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics they are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is blues oriented surprised there are so few reviews edit the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle it s getting easier with these i have also since found that while these are fantastic picks i actually prefer thedunlop jazz iii pick pack red nylon mmdespite lack of the max grip raised lettering they are just the most wonderful picks i ve used i do plan to try out some mm picks however as i suspect i m going to prefer a thicker pick the iii nylons feels slightly thicker than the max grips which i believe is why i prefer them i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space they work well and i haven t had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises i highly recommend them plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper cords these are thin they allow getting your pedals very close to each other and let you optimize your pedal board space i had other cables on my pedal boards i replaced everything with those i love these patch cables they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it i ve ordered about batches of these guys and i would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex the length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes however there are many cables of much lesser value which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown simple solid compact convenient audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables for the money you can t beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit once you setup your pedalboard that s it you aren t going to move stretch or step on these cables so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue they do however allow you to make the most use of the space on yourpedalboard packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require if you re like me you probably bought this to hook up an xlr microphone to a digital recorder or a pc it works fine for the handy type recorders but forget hooking this directly to a pc way too much noise this is a great pedal very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board i also like the tone a lot bear in mind i like the more vintage tones it s not a crisp crystal clear tone like you d get with a digital delay it s got more warmth there s a great video on yt from proguitarshop com that demos it very well it s got great short and long delay very smooth feel and the mod switch adds just the right amount of modulation to your tone to make it a tad fuller this is not a bright sounding delay it can be a tad dark at times if you re not careful i use this for my long delay sounds and use another delay for short slap back and echo sounds it s a mooer micropedal they work well together too to get a huge fuller ambient type of sound going i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain i use all my pedals right into the front of my amp as there s no effects loop i hope this helps your decision if you like warm old school tones you ll dig this pedal
208	i bought one of these in the beginning just to have something as this is better than having nothing at all but it s certainly nothing special the material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain so i only used it for a very short time on the other hand if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of then you ll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point i upgraded to a really nice wide black leather levy s guitar strap which is five stars all the way if you re a newbie and don t have a strap and are on a tight budget and need something then this planet waves strap will probably work for you till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear just my cents purchased to provide professional level i o for recording from mixers etc works very well for that purpose also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone s the bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book inputs provide for microphone phantom powered or not instrument balanced line on trs and balanced line on xlr connector tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed and dead silent output of high quality material also sounds superb and compares well with other very high quality gear everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this crowded price point though lacking lots of the i o and routing options you get with more expensive units this device unlike most other products in this price range has a quality feel to its enclosure jacks and controls drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly the input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too hot the color changes briefly to red helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering in sw to adjust your levels re computers and drivers almost all the tests went well on two laptops running windows installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great one of these recorded perfectly also the other which has a core duo processor fwiw had issues recording properly and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed and i tried them all this problem remained so for certain windows laptops you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout this issue is why four starts rather than five on a happier note this interface instantly worked with absolutely no installation on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio precise so for linux users this may be a very attractive option lastly documentation and bundled software is light this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear guidance re best practices etc but this is a nit overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily i ve been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands as i m rather petite luckily for me we found one of these secondhand it needed minimal repairs and it s just great i don t know anything about purchasing it new but i can tell you that this is a great beginner s instrument for someone who has small hands i ll also note that it s even affordable while it s brand new the notes are surprisingly clean sounding coming from a guitar that s so low priced i d definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument this strap replaces another one just like it which i use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons for stage i like something heavier good quality the holes work with my strap buttons okay my lower button is an output jack for an after market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button but this strap works okay with it it just takes a little more force to get it on which i m sure will go away over time with use great price for a simple strap at around i bought this during the black friday sale the price was right since if i was dissatisfied then i wouldn t be out that much money quality product well worth the purchase i would recommend this material is similar to my messenger bag s strap reasonably comfortable but i don t want it cutting into my neck does not go short enough for one of my smaller ukes a rubber band or spare capo is enough to fix that bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from it does the job nothing at all fancy about this strap two faux leather ends some nylon web and a triglide will do the job until you find the one of your dreams a good solid piece of equipment it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful the description listed slight wear marks on the back but i had to really look hard to find it one it came as well packed as a brand new guitar and looks like one i got two of these but wish i had got better ones using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster i had some noise even at moderate volumes after shielding it is absolutely quiet this peel and stick tape has conductive glue so you don t have to solder the overlap joints i overlapped about and had a x piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity the tape is petty easy to use sticks well inside the cavities and is strong i didn t break or tear any pieces i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups no strings i ve tried are like this it doesn t have a strong character but work together with your guitar my seagull now sound mellow with brightness also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it i have a taylor ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made good basic first amp great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house compact size makes storage easy lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best great picks sampler i bought this strap for a esp ec les paul style guitar i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price when i got the strap i was impressed the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar the back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they don t harm the finish on your guitar locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open it s not going to unlock on you strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar got what i paid for worth the money definitely sturdy and stable and i need more words so i can done you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar i have learned a few songs but i still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap i had the dean electric guitars in the past and a fender acoustic a while ago the fender and the dean s were very nice i thought the dean s had a very nice sound to them and so did the fender this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well i couldn t figure out the different tunings on it though it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal the other one s must be for some special type of music but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the dean s it is also very easy to hold unlike the dean s i have found the dean s also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and i have not found one on this guitar which is a plus but this is a very nice beginner s guitar if your just looking to get started i would stay away from those fender knockoff s and stuff like that and get this guitar i also got the cheap rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes all in all a very nice bargain based upon some of the other reviews i feel i got a different product as it didn t fit the descriptions given by others i ordered two of these and both were very thin material not sturdy at all second both straps were not adjustable to both mine measured from strap button hole to strap button hole fully extended they are useless to me as my guitar a dreadnought covers the middle of my chest when i put it on i believe i was given a substitute product since when i ordered these straps the price was just and now they re back up to as i write this i m really sick of these amazon substitutions for what i paid i won t bother returning them not worth the hassle i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars very disappointed warning if you see a price drop below don t buy it s probably not the product that s described here bought these because i thought they d be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when i want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce they give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string and they don t wear down the strings and i actually use them on occasion for my steel string acoustic guitar when i want a nice mellow tone the only negative is that because of being rubber they stick to the strings so they aren t great for quick strumming which i wish they were if you want a strap for you can t expect the moon i bought this along with other straps of higher price this is simple i would not want to use it with a tank top on or for guys on skin because it is stiff and not comfy but it is practical and works well the leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps both ends are the same leather one of my straps has a string on the end this kind does not it is made for the snaps no bells or whistles but i would recommend it for the price yes you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of mogami gold quality i found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound compared to my old cable the mogami gold produced a more transparent sound you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea when recording guitar i am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords no matter your playing style this cable will work well with your sound this strap is not a bad one but it just did not fit my guitar so that is the only problem i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it practical useful for drum kit tilts to match personal requirement fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances prof mike haller it s a strap it s pretty well made it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it it costs or less delivered what more could you ask for in a strap there may be better ones out there but at more and this does the same thing spend a few more bucks and get a padded one this one is comfortable for mins then it s cramp time just save yourself the hassle this one is too cheap to return and while it s ok it s not great for long term playing good design good price smart locking mechanism great for classic accustic and light electric guitars good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by over the months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house the guitar could take that head dive of death while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse my advice unless you plan to sit and play which you wont really need a strap anyways the whole time spend alittle more to get a leather strap spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play this amp is small in size but full of sound because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks very responsive very clean sounding this amp is well worth the price i got an ernie ball strap instead of a planet waves strap these are really great guitar locks i use them on all my guitars and i would highly recommend them to anyone great picks nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style i would recommend these for any guitar player for not a whole lot of money it does what more expensive eq pedals do its well made and sturdy with a metal body no more misplaced or lost picks this handy little device will fit perfectly in any out of the way spot on your instrument it fits good and came in the color i expected but there was one thing wrong the strap had a small stain i don t know why it said it was brand new but maybe not i don t know if from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body i know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adult however for its on sale at the time even if its not i can still learn to play since thats why i bought it is to learn the pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn t really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine all togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good i am happy with it good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have comes with whammy bar thats what i know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your amp edit so now that amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that i have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit i have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning i ve had this for about weeks now and this capo is simple and works great it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well if you know how much pressure to apply to the frets the capo works great though i always have to do a bit of fine tuning as was expected in the first place i love how cheap it was compared to the other capos and yes it s not made of plastic
209	i used this on my recent stratocaster build and the gold looks awesome it was easy to install and the finish was perfect i ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row on a pedaltrain board it s the perfect length and the very slight bit of excess can be zip tied against the pedaltrain leaving a total stealth install since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard i ve been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as i play on a weekly basis and it has been great being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily i ve owned it for a while now and haven t had any problems with it the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic this power supply is great for me i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great the knobs you see on it can sag the power to be less voltage you can get your pedal to sound as if it has a dying battery in it this pedal does exactly what my title suggests it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz very smashing pumpkins feel to this it doesn t do many different tones but what it does it does very well and frankly once i find a good tone out of a pedal i don t change it often anyhow this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards p s i have the russian variant
210	i haven t used this yet but it seems solid and idiot proof just like i need play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick very good price what more can i say these strings sound great they play wonderfully work well together have a nice brilliant but not tinny sound and are excellently made these are not going to unwind on you or break easily excellent that s all there is to say about it a great instrument mic using it on bass cabinet instead of a line out for that real live hit and the es is equal to the shure sm at less very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals definetly buy the power supply with it though it just makes it better and easier to use very nice product overall i was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great they have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great it s almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these it sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers you don t want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition i have been playing music for years and often i lose my picks during a performance i took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers best pick ever i would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only if you are going to be playing acoustic i would get their specific acoustic cable this is a very heavy guage sounds great i just ordered three different guitar straps online one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself then i found this and decided to get it the strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff i got this and switched over ahhh this is a guitar strap i see why you pay more it is so soft and comfortable it looks amazing this is just a great product i would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar thanks how much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand first it a great price about the same as a big mac lol second it fits great does exactly what it s supposed to do third now that i use a pick holder i wonder why i never did so before i do have a tendency to break drop or even wear out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency i have some solid heavier weighted stands that stand up to a quick grab of a pick from this holder but when using one of my cheaper lighter tripod style stands i make sure i m careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so i don t pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick great product couldn t live without it lol and it s not the manufacturer s fault i have some cheap light weight stands if you re looking for a pick holder i can t think of any reason not to try this one i m a beginning player so i m trying to make things as simple as possible starting out i was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic and really didn t want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks this strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar the ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issue the locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed your strap is now locked in place to remove it hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position that s it really it s that simple i m a taller guy and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should i need it longer at some point the leather feels robust and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box can t wait to see how it does after it breaks in this was a great choice and i couldn t be happier fits all standard mike stands stays where it is supposed to the perfect accessory for the stage or studio will buy some more
211	i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well i really wanted this to work but it doesn t don t bother it doesn t mute the strings at all one star just for it getting here on time cheap easy to use cuts sound ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment works exactly as described if you want sound reduction however you will need a metal mute this one works better than the smaller rubber ones on stage xcg tubular guitar stand with velveteen padding and security is very helpful tool for any guitarist i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain recommend it i works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it notice the curve of the mute and the curve of the top of the bridge it only is supposed to go on one way to match the shape of the bridge try reversing it and you ll see what i mean also you have to press the mute down almost all the way to the top ofthe bridge otherwise it won t mute the sound very much if used correctly this mute works well as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand having purchased many things before through amazon com i have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted remembering that there will always be a few cranks this music stand got good reviews and i can say that i too am very happy with it i would recommend this purchase to any one nice to use to muse your violin a must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing great buy great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek really cool looking rosin works well and is just overall awesome you cant break it either becuase its in wood dava grip tipitem is as advertised this is my first attempt at playing the mandolin for which i selected this product they work just fine for a starter i may learn different as time goes along assuming that you can teach an old dog new tricks as the saying goes i bought a glaesel bridge this glaesel rubber mute together i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews the mute fits the bridge fine but compared to a brass mute which of course works very well this mute seems to do absolutely nothing there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on also the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly as many of us do i suggest you buy something else this item does not work and is a total waste of money i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon fyi that cheap little electric violin is an awesome fun item just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley aglaesel self adjusting violin bridge mediumwith it i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all it does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin can t yet get the sound out of a violin that i want with it but still experimenting will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it s connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise all in all very well spent thank goodness pickup prices are coming down only a few years ago you could not find a pickup mic even this good for now if only the price of pickup chics would come down i m not sure how much i can say about a mute it s easy to put on and take off and it does its job it mutes the violin to a reasonable level i used an spl meter at a distance where a sustained open g string gave a reading of about db with the mute it dropped to db i then tried a yamaha silent electric violin unplugged and from the same distance it barely registered i recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about db and the yamaha read about db at that distance and setting so it won t make your instrument completely silent and from a purely subjective perspective it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin perhaps seeming about to louder had i not measured it with accessories tonal quality is typically important but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate surprisingly there was still a lot of tone left especially compared to the unplugged electric yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced you can t expect this to give great sound or complete silence but it won t disturb the neighbors or their dogs and it won t make the instrument sound dead this is about times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin and the latter will probably sound worse it s not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice
212	as is the case with all tools you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter it s extremely well built and performs its task very well pros extremely high quality metal comfortable rubber grips red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag of tricks effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringscons has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage the tool is spring loaded to open while this may be a plus for some people i find it less than ideal overall this is an extremely well made tool for your guitar kit if you re a bassist that likes stainless steel strings you ll appreciate how they cut like butter i have owned just about every tuner made they all had pluses and minuses i like this one a lot it is my tuner of choice right now the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate it is also small which i appreciate for this price you simply can t go wrong liked this capo it worked fine you can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension pedal is not working it just making noise poor quality control actually it looks like used pedal not like new don t recommend this product the power supply which is not included is a funky size it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but i wouldn t recommend it only because it is not the proper size the guy that was using this was using it with a fender telecaster and a single tube amp he found that the volume was cut by even with the pedal turned all the way up any time a pedal allows for volume loss it tends to effect tone yes mr sound engineer tone is a real thing the pedal is pretty bulky and won t fit well in most pedal boards but it s not any more wide than the morley but it seems to be taller longer and heavier i gave it stars because it s okay but it is far from great and i would not buy this product again i understand the price is cheap and if this is all you can afford then go for it but if you have the extra cheese spread it all i gotta say about this product is that i get a volume tone loss when it s plugged that is a very big problem for me other than that is very well built but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me this is a good pedal overall rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so i took the chance and i m pleased as some have said the low range has quite a steep slope to it uncomfortable foot angle but it s a big pedal and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so i can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth i wish the ts jacks were top bottom instead of side by side seems it would take right angle connectors better one gets in the way of the other or even better if it were a trs jack so you d only need one input i might modify it for that in our acoustic guitar band i often play intros and solos heavily amped but when the rest of the band members come in my strumming overpowers the rest so i needed a way to throttle back to either nothing or slightly amplified in between intros and solos then apply full power as needed this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described also i had an extra volt netgear router wall wart that saves battery life during practice i use the battery during gigs despite some comments i ve seen the battery is extremely easy to change no problem at all the device does reduce some of the signal going to my amp hence only stars used this foot pedal for a and so far i ve had know problems replaced the battery only once good product for a inexpensive foot pedal behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so i was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far so good the mic preamps sound pretty good clean and relatively quiet the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made it also seems to send hotter signal to my jbl eon s and that s a good thing the built in effects are probably its weakest point i ve heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit i also wish that the control room knob and outputs were independent of the main output slider that would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again it would also turn it into a buss mixer so all in all not too shabby for a mixer but i probably wouldn t use it for recording the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position but i stand in front of a mic on stage the pedal generates a lot of noise so i can t use it you get what you pay for king vox and dunlop high gain both passive have passed the test and i m pretty picky these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems they re functional durable and can be set up within just a few seconds i would have given this a higher rating however upon receipt one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight i had set the tension while inspecting the bag i found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand further inspection confirmed this as this block was indeed part of the tube and after several minutes of wrestling with it i was able to get it lodged back inside the block was part of the tension mechanism and once it was forced back into the tube the stand s performed flawlessly i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr which has a flawless basic looper built in but only seconds record and no undo i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn t need to carry a power adapter along the factory battery lasted about hour the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about minutes i started recording a loop with another rd fresh battery tested v with a multimeter and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording suggesting that it was faulty the lights started coming on and off randomly record undo all three together then off then undo on then all three on etc etc the first time i used the jamman xt with the factory battery it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything so i know it was not my poor technique the main problem was that it didn t matter how hard i tried even if i did a manual fade out there was always a gap of about seconds between the end of the loop and the start this makes the unit useless also it is poorly conceived in that to replace the battery you have to take out screws exposing the delicate printed circuit board the potential for damage here is very high also replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible read inevitable damage i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one it s going back to the store where i purchased it
213	bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot great quality for the money and works well mic is as described in life you mostly get what you pay for this stand really isn t an exception getting what you pay for though doesn t mean that it won t do what you need it to do this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it the great thing is it doesn t need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do it s a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case for a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play you now have no excuse for your expensive or cheap guitar to get beat up from laying around excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise does not have an on off switch which is a bit disappointing is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition this very cool its strong and hard first of all this is not the best microphone ever made but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected i give it stars as a microphone period without even taking the low cost into consideration they are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra for sure i bought one behringer xm then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about years go however we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech s personal sm s are busy at another job i honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the behringers at one time alice cooper and his band were using the behringer xm s however they may have moved on now for all i know these are not shure sm clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs they have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shure s have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq ed correctly they are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq it also is if anything more versatile than the sm as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an sm to pick up it doesn t overload easily has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the sm it has a reasonably decent blast filter so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don t have to add a windscreen another strength of these is durability my have sustained numerous drops a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall no damage at all to any of them i used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now i just shrug one weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise but on the stand handling noise is no issue mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable if you want sm s you need to buy sm s if you want a good all around microphone in the to class then try one of these no on off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the sm s we use and frankly the on off switch is a liability i don t think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all around microphone for the price you can pay more and get less this with my behringer xm is perfect i like that it is branded with the planet waves logo on the connectors rather than plain xlr cables which adds a sense of a quality look my gear this goes directly into my focusrite i interface and i m planning on using this same cable with a condenser microphone i have yet to purchase i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations small yet clean and versatile great for gigging remote events a great value for the money it does the job easy to get on and off seems to be sturdy and well built best of all the price i got this for dollars when it was on sale i don t like inch speakers for gigging but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a pa the inch speaker is okay for practice and it has a jack for an external cabinet be careful with the load you put on your amp though this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price good microphone for the money sounds a little better than my akg d s knocked it down to stars due to the fact it does not have an on off switch i am a user of behringer products though own of their amps this is a great quality microphone and at a good price keep it mind it is xlr for those that haven t noticed xlr is a better quality than other connections it s the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone looking for a good comparison and is much better quality it s flawless in quality and doesn t give any feedback i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price i haven t used this mic much yet but so far it has a great sound it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music for bucks i don t think you can beat it i m happy so far i may buy some more of them it is not too short as one reviewer complained it is a standard length just like the sm i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week i tested both of them they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said that s why i bought this and they are solidly built too not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine i don t expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me here is the but there is no on off switch this really pissed me off but this is my fault i should have read the star review first the photo shows no on off switch however this does not catch any attention and all seller seems to have trouble to say this product does not have this does not have that it only says what the product does have oh well i got stuck with two microphones without on off switch i can buy an adapter with on off switch for microphone it s made from china but very please for me sound so warm and vibration much better than famous brand will buy again with other size which stars very bright of them are great for lighting up the front stage of a band which is my application for them worth the money thing is great for multi pedal use this is a must if you have any of the danelectro fab pedals as anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat volts like candy you purchase the power supply search for danelectro da v ac adapter and this cable and you re good to go for up to pedals no more battery swaps this is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word i have many microphones and this compares to the range mics i clipped it on the neck head of my acoustic guitarit tunes up well and is very easy to readi turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingi have not used it enough to test the battery lifebut so far so good great for the price all pros and no cons so far this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one and it is not a toy don t be misled by the price this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics and while it may not be a marshall stack it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town the tone has been fairly pure although with a mike at least i can also get some pops crackles and squeals this is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp so the honey tone is not at fault in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input i ve used it with a high impedance mike astatic jt a low impedance mike behringer xm and electric guitar fender stratocaster it handles these without noticeable signal loss what is this amp exactly my guess is that danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox added a watt amplifier circuit and put the whole shebang into a retro case the result is quite appealing and the overall look and feel is one of quality the case is solid albeit plastic the three controls volume tone and overdrive while not detented have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components the input inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid someone in danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit s leather strap though it is more decorative than useful if you can operate an overdrive stompbox then you know how to work this amp the volume control is obvious the tone control alters the bass treble mix but not very significantly in my opinion the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree the instructions describe sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you as i said this is small but really not a toy i ve personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it s so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable and when i decide that i m good enough to panhandle in penn station this baby is going with me
214	i was messing around with the wiring in a mim strat and i ended up melting the switch so i ordered this one to replace it worked out perfect i should ve just got this cable the first time i have been using monster for years i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way was upgrading the chrome on an mim perfect fit used switchcraft jack includes screws and washer for the jack looks great my main headphones before were hd s which i thought were pretty good until i got these i have several pair of hd s one for mixing audio one for practicing with drums since they have decent isolation and one for her to use i have one of these and the amount of detail is great i have a set of m audio bx a s and these have a touch more clarity which considering the price difference wow for mixing audio though can t use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right but i think these will get used for mixing more and more with the finalizing on the bx a s i didn t know headphones could sound this good this pedal fish and chips which i find it to taste nothing like works nicely and was pretty cheap i ve heard some complaints worries about the flimsiness of the plastic as of the plastic seems pretty thick durable the switch does seem of a poor quality but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourself as for noise it doesn t seem to add much unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high and with distortion and what have you i haven t gotten to blast play bedroom level technically since i ve gotten it but it sounds good through the headphones i m using a squire strat fryette sas distortion now the fish and chips boss me all running into for now my vox vt which is outputting to my headphones soooo its sounding nicer that way i cant wait to get it through my other amps i ve also heard of very very short battery life i ve got the standard v i think from planet waves and it s powering it just right so far tomorrow s the real test a few hours at least
215	these guitar strings are nothing special and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price i was remodeling an old behringer and all i wanted was a fresh shiny set of new strings for playing they sound pretty good best part in my opinion is that they re made in america as well as the majority of fender products if you want to spend the extra money i d stil recommend ernie ball over these or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these fender strings you get what you pay for as far as shipping musician s friend did a great job getting the order out quickly i ll be ordering from musician s friend again i purchased this case for my newline pod hd it s a well built solid case for the price it fits the hd very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables i wouldn t drop my pod in this thing but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these they fit great and plenty of screws i am going to replace all my old screws with these my strat has bigger frets than any guitar i have ever owned and i have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges particularly on the rd string this to set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure while still feeling faster than an acoustic guitar they sound great last a long time stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets i bought these because i am constantly loosing screws when i change pickguards or do new builds these are exactly what the doctor ordered original equipment so they re the right screws a must have for every guitarist no matter what brand you own as they work on everything these are well made and don t strip when screwing in for the first time if it s a new project always drill pilot holes anyway i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used almost time to order another set i store them in a little sandwich bag stars perfect oem one word of warning if you are not good at soldering and or you don t have a good iron don t try this yourself the contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry i recomend readingthe fender stratocaster handbook how to buy maintain set up troubleshoot and modify your stratif you are unsure these fender pickguard screws are excellent they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment i replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they re much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent pretty disappointed in the color as the review title indicates what i received is more of a black chrome or dingy stainless color these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad some are very dull looking very disappointing really ok so they are just screws but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one and it is fender licensed man this is perfect some people says that the cs is noisy but i thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play if you don t have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there s gonna be a lot of noise most of all bcuz of the compression obviously for me this is perfect doesn t make any noise with my conections tottally recommend this you get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your stratocaster however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard other than the two missing screws this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your stratocaster they work no issues handy to have on hand dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place i put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time great strings and great value i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose this makes the second one of this straps that i have ordered and i love them they are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself i don t have not one bad thing to say great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap what can i say fits perfectly for a pickguard on a fender style guitar you could probably find them at a cheap hardware store but i was too lazy to go looking this is a solid stand with good adjustability and a thick decent quality foam to cushion your guitar bass its only fault is its price amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good simply search for guitar stands on here and see for yourself pickguard screws the screws are not very tough and you have to be gentle with them so that the screwdriver doesn t bugger up the heads they are not high enough quality that they can be put in and taken out more than a couple of times before they become worn what can you say about graphtech that isn t good for a product is a awesome and improves the sound playing of older and newer guitars with plastic saddles graphtech works make sure you know which style you guitar takes and buy it and for the price i payed i got ten pieces wow awesome perfect thickness and action what else can i say you won t be sorry you got these they are all i ll get from now on they work nice on the guitar make sure you use glue on the on the wood screw when installing it this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out i have an abundance of strat parts so when a vintage non strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench i plunked these on the pots the customer liked them so much he kept them on now what to do with these other knobs unless you guys are receiving something i am not how can you give this anything more than one star my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my fender stratocaster this is inexcusable all the other fender backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route but not this mint green one i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost never really had to mess much with this item its a quality piece of metal with the nice f logo on it mounted my cheap amazon start neck just fine
216	i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster works great i didn t notice any change in tone it just worked like the old one but the main this is that it worked and my tele sounds as great as it always did i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these they fit great and plenty of screws i am going to replace all my old screws with these i was a little disappointed don t know if it s a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of pots was out of spec k and were almost out k k was right on the money and the other were within they are ctl s so i m a bit confused other than that they work fine they have the nut washer and cap included no knob i will be upgrading the caps its a great pedal sound really crunchy i got a peavy vyper sometime i use this if i want a crunchy style but the amp i got is really good and has its own distortion styles i use the heavy metal config on this pedal i recomend it to anyone does not introduce noise i run it on the stock battery it still works you can make your guitar sound like metallica or megadeth of course it also depends on a lot of things like pickups amp etc i also have a very old little peavey practice amp this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life listen to it on the boss website i heard to it and then i thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them but it does sound really really close regards forgive my english not from the u s that s not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps everything you can imagine this amp ranks up there with the best of them i m surprised as i ve hated with a passion every dsp solid state amp i ve ever played this hybrid is incredible the effects are excellent the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording it has many onboard effects but i have racks and pedals that outdo those so i don t use them for recording it s not a band amp unless you re an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums it s watts but it s loud it s just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums though you might be fine for overdrive depending on the venue and situation it s not going to emulate certain amps like a vox very well but it does excellent with a fender black face excluding the tube reverb it does a bassman ok but doesn t quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original bassman doesn t cost dollars other it does a marshall pretty well marshall s based on bassman without the delicate touch so there s no wonder the acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full yet doesn t sound like a filter and are amazing voices you can bypass that and use it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original super champ i also have a x vintage box i connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound when i m just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don t wanna have to dial in sounds with my vox ac or fender deluxe reverb then this my amp of choice it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe yes this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp i ve played outside of a mesa boogie buy it in fact buy two this is a future classic it s a cheap speaker stand heavier in terms of weight than i thought it would be cheaply made the safety pin is kind of a joke overall though it ll do the job i would not use this at the highest height setting but one or two notches lower else it starts leaning es el output original de fender que mas se puede decir producto de calidad me gusto saludos a todos desde venezuela i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot it works like a champ i m a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only this is a solid little usb interface there are no frills and there s no latency i have used this for years without any problems and it s very portable i run this between my small channel mixer and my laptop for recording guitar and it s well worth the price to have one of these around can also be used with tape players to import audio into your computer i use this for more than just guitar recording
217	i am extremely pleased with this amp i purchased it because i was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill the numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud the other reviews detail the exact specs much better than i could so i will defer to them for that however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone i highly recommend it this pickguard was used it not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before genuine fender pick guard it s pre shielded perfect for your next build or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart nearly all of the reviews i read on these were very positive and i concur these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price they do add a little noticable weight to the headstock but it s not a problem it fit my american vintage s strat my guitar had an hole pickguard i ordered an hole pickguard and it fit like a glove the guitar is ply plastic black white black this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like i am happy with the purchase bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat doesn t fit perfect kinda bummed but oh well i m using this pedal like a clean boost for leads and i m very happy with it s sound uncolored db of clean gain
218	my first review was a knee jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it i couldn t get it to sound like i wanted it to i was so wrong in giving it only stars i must now rerate it with a star this amp does almost too much for the money my only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has it can do anything and sound any way you want it too wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have i am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite amp when i totally figure it out if i ever do the sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it if you are looking for a small plug and play amp this isn t it but it you re looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities this is it it is growing on me and i wouldn t part with it now was upgrading the chrome on an mim perfect fit used switchcraft jack includes screws and washer for the jack looks great old screws rust and often when presented with a new pick guard there are instead of holes for attachment this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms fender quality is just a step above the competition and worth the extra money over cheaper generic products worked perfectly for my latest guitar project very nice quality part fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed but my mexi strat is now complete came with more screws than i needed they were the right size no issues thanks you shouldnt be disappointed with this item
219	this is my second fender polish cloth they are basic but that s all i need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after i m done playing the only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges even though this has happened to me it didn t keep me from buying the second one the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me it gets softer with time and use overall i have to say that i m satisfied with the fender polish cloth i own two of these the first did not have a compartment door so things just roll around inside case not happy but this one is just fine looks great no i would not take it on tour but as far as run around and taking lessons its safe all latches match up well enjoy will order again item arrived as described and on time way larger than expected but my son loved it says it s easier to use than the smaller cloths we ve gotten before provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine does not leave streaks if used properly this dries quickly every time delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a fender product
220	buttons itself are fine however when i was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar right above the thread and i even pre drill it there is no way i can get it out so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it now slightly off center now a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up this is a very nice looking back plate and for the price its cheep the holes are in the right place for the screws i really like this strap it s comfortable adjusts easily and the pick holder is really convenient this is my second one for my other guitar
221	it would be improper for me to claim that these fit stratocasters because i have a stratocaster remake and i drilled new holes for a stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in what i can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn t seem cheapo surprised it didn t come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag the size of the screws was right the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick and it came with more than enough to install a stratocaster pickguard i m sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways need volume knobs and tone so for the price and in the past i have always purchased packs together with no issues however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of sets no consistency in quality example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item also some had bright white lettering and others did not but where not vintage lettering either guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on will try other brands next time i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic there are tons of settings and the leds are nice and bright for dark stages or bright outdoor venues highly recommended i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them they are used by other artists that approve of them slash from guns n roses uses them old screws rust and often when presented with a new pick guard there are instead of holes for attachment this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms this is a very well made guitar stand it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time i bought this stand for my sons first guitar but i may have to order myself one as well for the price this stand just can t be bet well unless you absolutely botch production it s hard to go wrong with some guitar knobs typical plastic durable and looks good i wanted to add to my pedal arsenal but i didn t have the big bucks to spend on a tube screamer so i took a chance on this little stomp box from china it compares itself to the ts right on the box and for good reason they use the same chip more importantly the construction is solid good looking and takes up minimal pedal board space the on off switch seems a little chintzy but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome i only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with and plugging in to a power supply not provided with unit it turned my partscaster into a blues making machine it s responds well to your technique and you can make it so funky you can smell it it truly does have true bypass and logical controls i don t have a ts to make direct comparisons but for the money this little pedal gives me exactly the tone i want and i saved about or bucks ba da bing
222	i ve ordered two of these kits in the aged white and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor accidentally stepped on them and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures i ve been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar i ve used different strings from d darrio to ernie ball and now i always use fender strings for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super s the only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the s the bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a strat i don t use the tremolo very much so i don t know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super s i figure i might as well get the ones that are designed for the strat also these are the oem strings that fender installs at the factory so you can t go wrong with that i highly recommend them excellent product at a righteous price helps my guitar stay in tune changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better absolutely perfect some other reviewer complained about theirs being blemished but i m guessing they just didn t know to pull off the protective layer mine was shiny new and was an absolute perfect fit on my mexi strat the price was the best anywhere and with free shipping i couldn t be happier the product arrived as in the description but i made the mistake to buy it for my fender squier bullet not a full strat there are differences between this pickup covers and my fender squier first the magnet tips in the squier are closer together i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats second the squier s has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent not the most beautiful thing but worked the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly i like replacing the pickguard and other plastic parts to give my guitars a different look it takes under accessory kit pickguard to give your guitar a make over money well spent fyi parchment is slightly off white unless you re comparing right next to a pure white pickguard you probably would think they re simply white i was happy it was made in the usa but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn t done by shipping unless you guys are receiving something i am not how can you give this anything more than one star my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my fender stratocaster this is inexcusable all the other fender backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route but not this mint green one i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost i got the aged white i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one i have a mim strat every thing went together with out any issues best price online and the shipping was super fast i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar very good tunner with bypass switch i think it s a good choise for any pedalboards i changed this for a tc electronic polytune
223	i got mine yesterday and love it it sounds grate i didn t know what amp to get i looked and looked read a lot of reviews and even got on youtube to see what people had to say and seems this one had a lot of good reviews i knew fender has a good name for amps and for the money this one was the one i am so glad i got it it gave life to my electric guitar i bought mine somewhere else but still grate amp i didn t want to spend a lot of money for an amp and didn t want to get something small for or dollars less and would out grow with my music as i get better playing guitar but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will this will save me money in the long run i am very happy with it i like the five year warranty that came with it you can t go wrong great sound and its not to big nice size amp and easy to pick up nice looking amp i was buying a pawn shop guitar when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar i didn t expect to actually use it but what the heck i could sell it and make a bit of money back got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the frontman just to see if it worked i was surprised to find out not only did it work it sounded very good i own a deluxe reverb all tube amp and the little frontman had the fender sound what really was impressive was the reverb it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound i actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well i normally use a blues jr for small gigs but the frontman did a fine job on some smaller gigs when all i need is a little reverb i just plug straight into the amp and it worked well plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it s small and easy on the back all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it i would easily pay full retail it is a nice little amp might even see if i can squeeze a inch speaker into it this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand it s easy to use on stage it can be used with only one hand and it has a low profile that doesn t take up a lot of space when folded and it doesn t stick out as an eyesore on stage i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it just like the last reviewer i also use this to link my mxr dunlop pedals together they are surprisingly well made and i dont notice any signal distortion or drop off in sound at all no cracklies nada i have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords they are solid durable and reliable and cheap as well enjoy i have both the fender g dec and the and the line spider jam just blows them away the controls are much more intuitive than the g dec line like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so i could hear my guitar over it and i was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks or drum beats i wanted and the only time i had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easy i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line once you go further into the amp and get into the dubbing recording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedal the amp can get really loud and i don t see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side show since i have only had the amp for a short time i can t say anything about how it will holdup but i have other amps by different companies and the quality is just fine by the way i have a g dec for sale addendum the following is my take between the jam and the series do with it as you wish a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years the spider does not have on board song or drum loops like the spider jam if you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then the isyour amp if you need a practice amp go with the jam i have both amps and as far as i am concerned the jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the spider does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the spider technology with a jm looper as its engine while the spider i have the is a nice amp it is very specific to the user needs and isnot that flexible i do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as i used the jam for a longtime without and only acquired the express pedal when i ordered the spider also be very aware that the line documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there so called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation i purchased this for my love of playing guitar i like blues style and classic rock this watt amp will get the job done it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew so i had no bass control arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging you just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings this amp is rated watts so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a watt into ohm i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen i d recommend it but don t buy it if your looking for a really decent tone it s just a practice amp
224	sturdy stand thedanelectro honeytone mini amp beatnik burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar the color of this unit is a soft burgundy almost brick red in color paired with the zero hum ac adaptor it s a highly portable amp setup ultra portable by using a v battery instead of the ac adaptor i do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig though a headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amp s impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouse included with the amp is an owner s manual with simple start up instructions you ll need to have your own cord the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isn t provided as part of the amp package the manual has several control settings for the following sound tweaks clean spanky warm jazz big amp overdrive killer blues distorted rhythm thick solo woodstock fuzz send the cats under the bed twang mondo sustain brit solo tune sparkle clean early s clean solo late s neck solo s brit s soloi paid under for this amp and couldn t be happier with the product don t hesitate to pick one up for yourself update there is a space in the back of the unit for volt batteryduracell v alkaline batteries countor you can use the included ac adapter to power the amp update per reviewer paul stewart as a point of clarity the current version of this item does not ship with an adapter nor cable be prepared to purchase these in tandem fyi update almost years ago i bought this item and it s still going strong great deal update yup it s still kickin along super buy on this mini amp great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic great price very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing i haven t owned my electric guitar for over a year but i ve only replaced its strings once i ve been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new at this rate it seems that the current strings i have installed would last forever would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set this item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars i tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in position the short extension in the picture is not on the unit i received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered i would purchase this unit again and again it is a good piece and a good deal base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won t topple over but an arm on it and that could be a different story the action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about while i appreciate the weight of the base i do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle works well for acoustics as well as electrics i have amazon prime so i got it quick well made and folds easily this microphone s quality is amazing i just hooked it up to my pc windows and it worked no hassle whatsoever nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great i recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises the stand that comes with it is very stable but it is low to the ground or in this case desk table so it may pick up some unwanted background noise computer fans mouse clicks movement etc this is a nice microphone stand i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems i would purchase this again it s sturdy and gets the job done i bought this tuner for my mandolin i have to play a little louder than i d like for the tuner to hear me the display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays i ve seen but it s so small that i never have to take it off and it s doing its job well i m pretty fond of this little guy i purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together it does and it does it well very solid build never felt cheap in any way perfect for its intended use i purchased a second one after using the first for one month would buy again should the need arise this mic stand will work great for mic ing full stacks and guitar amps some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg works as advertised great at eliminating feedback in a live setting also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly my first desk mic stand and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use it worked once when i originally set it then kaput it s never worked properly since i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it s at the right height i would not purchase this product again i am completely blown away with these headphones the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic use this for my desk mic at home it hold my mic right where i want it and doesn t move from where i place it worth every penny and then some not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip solid plastic brass threading adjustable pivot screw i ve always been pleased with on stage products even down to there cheap clips provides everything i need from a mic stand everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm packs up small i knocked off one star because if you look carefully at the stand it leans ever so slightly it is after all a cheap chinese stand
225	works as advertised for my purpose it is in front of a computer speaker set with woofer for use on a vizio tv as a sound system works fine i have other behringer gear and it always works i ve used several different kinds of strings over several years playing i m no expert but these strings sound good to me subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing if you havent tried em they re worth a shot i love d adarrio strings great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers d adarrio strings rule see ya i have always used d addario strings since the early s when i first found out they were manufactured right here on long island i ve never been disappointed by the quality i enjoy this product and i definitely use them on my acoustic they are good strings highly recommended enjoy them these are good i dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range they all work well length of being brillant is somewhat limits but it appears to be in most of these level of strings i had never owned an electronic tuner before but have used the large models and the iphone apps this is a great product it is easy to use adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument i haven t banged it around but have had no problems with durability bright easy to read display i would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike i would definitely buy these strings again they are high quality great durablity and a great price the martin name is synonymous with quality extra light gives good action for my small guitar not so hard on the fingers tone is not bad but not same as or gauge this is my thrid levy s strap and it is as good as the rest of them that i have had for a few years i have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others i have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but i don t see a problem with it so far and i use it regularly i have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer but it is a standard size i prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials for the price the strap works well and i would buy more levy s straps if needed this is a great music stand very sturdy very well built just wish it came with a bag then it could be put in the guitar case but ill find one thanks seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks for the price of these strings you can t go wrong however compared to elixers the sound just isn t as full these strings are great for the price they sound nice and are pretty long lasting but dont last or sound as nice as higher end strings but who cares when the strings are affordable these strings are great for people are starting because its cheaper and its not a big deal when you break a lot of strings i think this is the best tuner i love it it really works and its really easy to use it
226	come on now these are ernie ball strings what can i say that hasn t been said a time already there the best buy them great guitar strings and affordable i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly they never used too its not that humid here so i don t know if i got some bunk strings or if the quality has gone down in the last year or if really its the boston weather historically i have sworn by these though it s tough to shell for a pedal that is not an effect but now that i ve had it for a few weeks i m glad i bought it although my guitars pretty much stay in tune warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while i m playing them the boss tu is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time when you play in a band you got to have a pedal tuner and you can t go wrong with boss lovely strings for rhythm guitarist special i m using it for reggae skanks rhythm and it sounds warm and scream thanks i was doing research on a new guitar rig and i kept seeing this amp mentioned almost all of the reviews i read were positive i decided to order it for a home practice amp when i don t want to dig out my main rig the build quality is solid it feels like a much more expensive amp many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed i was really impressed with the packaging the documentation and the build of the amp this is my first fender amp and probably not my last the sound quality is amazing being a heavier rock metal player i would never have chosen a fender amp even for home practice the first channel has a wonderful clean tone and the second channel has several modeled amps the tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain there is even an acoustic model and it sounds pretty good too there are a ton of youtube videos of people demoing the sounds of this amp so i won t go much further into this the included effects are simple but pretty cool as well and can be switched on and off via the optional foot switch overall i d say that this is a great amp for the price and like many others i highly recommend it i have tried other picks like this that had points which wen t as confortable this one is more confortable and has great grip if you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out admittedly i don t use these on my high end stuff i use these on my cheap axes to bang on why the are strong durable and sound good the tone isn t as pure as some other strings on the market but for the cost they do the job the really good strings i typically have to change often as i like a light string these hold up well taking a good bend and beating if you have a teenager who isn t light with the pick or if you have something you tend to get very aggressive with these are perfect stars for what they are in years i have had every kind of capo out there this is the right one this one works buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case they are well made and inexpensive enough i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room this does the trick just fine it is light sort of cheap etc but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg i wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home practicing it is just fine the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life this is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural life i e that brightness that new strings have the drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings so are these any good yes they feel great not overly slippery or coated and sound great though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings i m excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player i change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer about gauge these light strings go from to as compared to my old martin s which went from to in summary d addario makes good strings and these are no exception if you re looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted as opposed to aggresive tone with lighter low e then you should check these out ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure they work great you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings i use these on an old gibson semi hollow body it was delivered fast when i hooked it up i didn t expect it to be so loud and clear so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics when i put a wind screen on it the sound was so nice i couldn t stop singing for another hour i only meant to test it when i unpacked it i m buying more at that price it s a steal get a couple now before supply and demand kicks in filter is of good size and easily comes apart for changing the fabric i will probably use panty hose if it gets torn other than that it works so what more can be said as the title it works the way it s supposed to but i wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it won t move easily nevertheless it s a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground just remember use some common sense don t expect the guitar to totally stable these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings these strings last days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch ernie ball strings are garbage the only time i will buy these is if it s the only thing available most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than days out of a set of strings touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh you can spend for a set of ernie ball or d addario every days or you can spend for a set of dr strings and change them once a month or you can spend for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every months it doesn t make sense to use these crappy ernie s unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra great buy instead of shelling out over for a line a c adapter for my pocket pod i decided to give this one a try out and i m glad i did it s well made works great and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process can t beat this one for sure this pedal is exactly what i have been looking for since three years ago when i started performing the distortion on this is deep has long sustain and has a nice tone to it that the classic boss ds pedal does not have it s perfect for a great sound from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat bruising solos i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it however word of fair warning the pedal itself uses a v power charge rather than the typical guitar f x pedal v barrel jack look at the power supply of a boss pedal to see what i am talking about this proco rat pedal does not use that if you buy this pedal you will have to do one of four things buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal consistently use and replace batteries find a converter from barrel jack to mm jack be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself other than the above excellent pedal these just sound great huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel these are my favorite strings for electric guitar i ve been using them since i started playing about eighteen years ago i ve tried other strings like gibson and d addario but i like the sound and feel of ernie balls the best they feel nice full thick hefty i play blues jazz and bluesy rock i use these on a gibson les paul vintage mahogany and a yamaha neck thru body electric and they are good for the music i play and for providing a full bodied sound there are a whole host of big name guitarists who use these strings and for good reason i buy them in packs to save money can t seem to find that option here on amazon come with all cables needed solid and very much worth the money im very happy with this purchase no regrets at all it had been a while since i had some eb s best packaging i have seen and for the price don t order just one pack very pleased always have a spare pair in your case very nice guitar pics sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics very lovely size was as expected great sound probably the best kapo out on the market very high quality and a sleek look easy to use what more could you want i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles it s also cheaper nice quality fretboard oil has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way i would definitely recommend this worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard spent next to nothing on this part but it saved the day on a side project for a friend thank god i buy spares this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly it doesn t get any more elemental but i soldered it in and it s doing fine not for real heavy usage anyway i was looking for a pedal that didn t take my life s savings and still performed well i found it right here it works well with no problems to report next week i ll purchase another with a different feature it also arrived super fast my guitars largely stay at home so they don t require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case hard cases almost always cost dollars or more and also take up about twice as much room which is problematic for storing multiple instruments in most cases a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs and costs about of the price of a hard case i bought two different variations of the fender gig bag and i believe the one pictured here is the one that has fender medium guitar picks as zipper handles which is a cool touch the case fits my fender squier strat guitars or other guitars of a similar size snugly there is not a ton of padding but more than you might think from the pictures especially on top the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps i can t say that the zippers will withstand years of use but for most uses they should do just fine glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars my son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it great purchase i needed picks so i ordered an assortment i have been trying different ones i seem to like them all this is one great piece the quality of the guitar is amazing and for its price outstanding it plays beautifully with my w amp and with my experience of guitars this is a go getter otherwise i would see this one stand out to a les paul beautiful tone and durable string nice tension very good for bends sweep picking and rakes did i mentioned great value this product isn t really one to review but it does what it advertises i use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my tu great tuner by the way starting to build my pedal board so i figured better to start off with a dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a t rex fuel tank which i m planing on in the future great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks can t beat it since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because i m a beginner and don t have much calais yet also i like the first day of new strings look shiny i would recommend this to any beginner im sure these strings are fine i like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my jackson rose these however or the high e the jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it because with a jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings i was left with worthless strings my mistake just not for one of my electrics my mistake but i do love the other strings they offer so im out four bucks oh well
227	these picks are nice and thin just what i was looking for in a pick they seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down i m satisfied with these picks these are awesome strings i put a set on my strat and tele they offer a clean sound feel good and can hold their own on a tremoo dive and a mad bend i will be using this model and brand as long as they make them get them the absolute best guitar stand made strong and durable i bought one about months ago and just ordered a second hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands i ve bought these d addario strings a few times because they are a great deal they sound nice and bright and they last a good while they are easy on the fingers the best part is that you save money by buying them in a pack musician s gear tubular guitar stand black pair is a good deal for musician buy it if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to like the title says ive been using these for years used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with i either use the s or the s and detune them i bought this power supply for in home use i don t do too much gigging or recording so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around the product works very well i m able to power of my pedals easily the cords are plenty long in length however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other i e having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal however that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product i haven t had to use any of the special adapters though but i plan on getting a line dl so having the line adapter is a great added touch best of all all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home i ve been using this product for months now and have no complaints you can t beat the price good cheap strings for guitar hard to beat the price i am not an expert on guitar strings so i hope that helps i have an epiphone es and recently put these strings on it oh man do they sound nice it s like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy slinkkkkkkyyyy d clear amazing cable very underrated incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall i use this capo all the time on both instruments a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also i did and they love it i wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands there is of course very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny but hey it s just a volt battery i just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device they put a lot of thought into this amp and it is outstanding for the budget price keep in mind you can patch another volt powered device through this one to enhance it i will at some point run my boss digital delay box through it to check that out the belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice and i got it in red as a change of pace because i always get black with my equipment it looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character nice product danelectro i do like these strings had a few packs of these from christmas opened up one recently and the string or st string was not in there next time i m gonna have to open up the package to make sure they re all in there should measure them too didn t open them to keep them sealed until i was ready to use them no more it s not fancy but it s well though out and you can t beat the value the edges don t cut your neck and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want like others i had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment the foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want and it flexible thin enough to go through the buckles if needed excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass got this stand to mount a studio projects c condenser mic the stand is very stable and works well it is very reasonably priced as well i have purchased of these strap locks i would recommend them to all they work good very solid hold thanks decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar other than that they appear ok nothing to rave about i have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound i want boss digital delay i really didn t like the sound of the delay overall no real positives to mention carbon copy analog delay worked great for cleans but totally muddied up my lead distortion tone even though it was in my fx loop i couldn t get the repeats to duck under the main signal nova delay i really wanted to like this presets tap tempo and a nice feature set but the sound just lacked warmth it was very digital soundingat this point i wasn t sure what i wanted analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy digital delays were clear sounding but just too digital and uninspiring i was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline when i found this pedal analog dry signal thru with digital delay this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved set it to the type delay and its perfect sure it doesn t have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay this can t be beat at this price range sure enough when i checked the strymon timeline specs i found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set but for a delay pedal is just too much for me buy this if you are chasing tone you won t be disappointed skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc the fact of the price for this and the cent shipping is pretty damn good because i have silverstone ss s and a stratocaster and i took parts of of one ss to fix the other then i bought these strings for it fixed it up and now that guitar sounds better and less buzzy than the strat also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase i lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and really cheap shipping i will buy more later to fix my other guitar when i get the bridge nuts replaced
228	i m using this in v in a watt tube amp it s really nice i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube the other good thing is it comes in a box from jj unlike some tubes from other places i ve ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them i ll re rate this item if my problem is fixed but maybe this is normal i have a vox ac hw x and i put this jj ax into v i have a significant volume gain reduction now i know it s the tube because i can put the stock ruby back into v and the volume gain is back i haven t checked yet but i d say there is a loss in volume i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube it s not stamped to be one so that s why i m confused is it typical of jj to have more headroom i m not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps i love this thing and for the price you just can t beat it it seems sturdy and i have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up i haven t tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my electric guitars very nicely set up only took about min or so and it included all the tools necessary i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for more like i said for the price you can t beat it ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time they sound great and i have yet to have use set of strings by ernie that were faulty or disappointing in any way of course i have only used a few other brands of strings so i don t have an arsenal of wisdom to compare the quality of these strings to but do take my word when i say that these are extremely reliable good sounding and affordable d addario strings are like the kias of the string world they make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time these strings are ok i ve always been partial to nickel wound particularly semi flatwound but i digress my typical strings are elixirs so i m used to them lasting a long time in this case the strings sound good like most nickel strings do but they didn t last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless and stopped keeping intonation accurately so like most d addario strings so they re not bad but don t expect them to last like elixirs do you get what you pay for i have had the shure version of this mic not naming any names haha and this mic is just as good actually i take it back it s better than the shure mic because this one isn t overpriced
229	update the very latest vic firth phones have a much improved headband and less bulky earcups while i now prefer the latest direct sound ex s a vast improvement over my original ds cans mentioned below the firth s are still very good and as a bonus cost half as much i still use both brands please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones without background noise for reference one can easily play them too loudly which in turn can lead to hearing loss over time update i now own three pairs of vic firth isolation headphones and i m happy to report the original pair is still going strong meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units carefully adjusted to add little no volume to the signal path unity gain as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a behringer u control uca dac and a small behringer eurorack ub mixer to provide silky smooth state of the art amplification for the vic firth isolation headphones the resulting sound is absolutely top drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price about total i paid for the entire system affordable technology in the service of great art update these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones the newest pair live in my gym bag both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble e g getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat bonus tip because these are full sized headphones with large ear cups i frequently use them in conjunction with the new hearos high fidelity full audio spectrum ear plugs lt the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does i play my mp player or other signal source decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate decibels leaving me with the same music and way less background noise this stuff may not fit your head ears as well as it fits mine but you might try it if you re so inclined original review how does an adhd adult maintain focus in a busy high tech work environment soothing music is part of the fix active noise canceling headphones i ve tried and replaced several but they either sound badly are prone to electrical mechanical problems or both what to do vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers isolation headphones i own and use them both the direct sound phones block a bit more noise the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing both have excellent sound quality enjoy monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time you cant go wrong with monster cables i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks the strings definitely have a good tone though i ve got them on a low end mandolin they may be more than the mando needs but they sound great received a new w hartke x bass combo at church tube pre and ss power amp the preamplifier has one ax it was an eh it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube he would not send a warranty replacement my suggestion new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like doug s tubes tube depot eurotubes or some other reputable tube vendor i don t trust ebay tubes and won t spend the hard earned cash on nos replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue like the previous reviewer i bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp and it just did wonders to warm the sound only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all it s tubes and thinking if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre amp imagine what some of these will do in my fender sigh always something anyway this is great i am sure i will get more
230	spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier these can t support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily they sure are portable though not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny i ve been buying dunlop pick for at least years now and i love the feel and the grip the picks last for a really long time and i would recommend getting several thickness for different applications but for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly amazingly sturdy for the it isn t as sturdy as some but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands it folds up very nicely i d buy it again it s as good as it looks with that in mind it s perfect it s not very sturdy if you re using it outdoors and it s windy but hey what do you expect from the way it looks i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass these things work really great i love them this little music stand folds up small enough after some disassembly to fit in a pouch less than feet tall and inches wide once assembled it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you re standing seated on a stool or in a chair the angle of the tray is not adjustable the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location but for a portable stand it s hard to find fault with this one especially given the low cost
231	daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money exactly as described and very affortable would recommend this to anybody it is a guitar stand does what it is built to do good buy for the cost i would purchase again these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm series form factor i use mine for the much heavierblue microphones encore studio grade dynamic performance microphone and this clip holds it right where i adjust it to the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision machined mine effortlessly mate with anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom black anon stage stands b tripod boom microphone standand amusician s gear die cast mic stand black which are the only stands with which i ve used this clip bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the shure sm and pg and similar or a different brand that uses that form factor then this clip will probably not work also i cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares actually you should do that i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model i have five or six on hand including a few spares and if i needed more clips this is the one i would purchase
232	the rat has been used by everyone from david gilmour to dave grohl to give you a grasp of its range it does everything from light crunch to marshall style thick rhythms to all out face melting distortion rich harmonics near infinite sustain and a mid range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it the fact that it s built like a tank ensures it s going to be around a long time after my playing days are over no loss of initial tone with this pedal which was on my priority list as i love the sound of my guitar and amp the hall setting is phenomenal transparent in your signal chain when off as well love it not every tune needs tremolo i grant you but when you need one this will do the job and them some simple controls the led pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit s settings at all times silent switching in a fx loop there s not a trace of hiss hum or noise in any form in a chain running into an amp s input there is a slight volume increase not much but a little no big deal really unless you re a real tone freak there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either the box is ultra solid the jacks are all metal the switch is stout in short this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean warm tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit it it anchored to my board it is not going to come off because it s that good besides how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it i have one one these from the s back home and when i was looking for a new peddle i found this was still the best around i remember searching for the right peddle back in the s and going through dozens of them before settling on the rat and it s exactly the same simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain i run it through all manner of amps including marshalls vox and even crate both tube and transistor and with a few quick easy adjustments i get exactly what i m looking for no matter the box i m an old school player meaning i want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby i own a fender reverb reissue and i had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very very difficult to find however i bought this jj electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until i had enough money to afford a higher end tube and this blew me away i was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it in fact i think i will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it s almost dead before i purchase another tube as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard however if used as a fuzz pedal instead it truly shines since this is really what it is does it have distortion yes is it valuable as such not in my opinion it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that another gripe i have is the volt slot most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply not so with this pedal you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries which sux imo especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain anyways while this is fun to play with you should definitely consider the sound you are going for if you prefer to play a more grungy or s era metal then this will work for you for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere imo easily the best quality capo for it s price looks great on any guitar i came across shubb a few months back when my capo finally gave out after years i bought the c stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars but i had to adjust it any time i went to use it on my les paul which has a s neck and fretboard ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day i just got it in the mail yesterday and it snapped right on the lp with a firm click i didn t even have to adjust it it looks amazing in use and is just the best and simplest design you know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what don t forget to remove it when you guitar is resting it s easy to forget it s there forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos this never effects my fret thumb or forefinger exactly what i was looking for in a capo i will have these for a long time and i m a shubb guy from this day forward tried it didn t like it returned it just not my cup of tone that s all i have more use for an overdrive
233	i like the product i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost i thought that it could hold a few more picks i think i putted about picks in it but hey it works and i would buy it again i forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar thats what i did it looks good and durable also it s cheap works and it is good no problem very standard one all your own preferences so you need to try it out before you say if that works for you old good design for the price i ve bought of them and just put it on all guitars so wouldn t have to search for pick again cheap quick and easy it serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive it s almost painful i haven t had it break and it doesn t cause any issues with the instrument so i m more than content with this handy inexpensive capo these are well made good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own will purchase again enjoy this is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looper no complaints with this for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient i placed it on a filing cabinet next to where i practice and filled it up love love love the hastle free access to my picks thanks guys for the great little product all smiles i bought these because i needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board i have the planet waves patch cords called so i thought these would cover it being when i went to hook up they were still too short so i immediately blamed these cords ooooops took out the tape measure so i could complain and found that these are indeed i then measured the planet waves and found they were actually not my bad these seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are if you want to spice up your board go for some color i love dunlop straps because i m a tall guy and they re long enough for me not to look like an electric guitar playing mariachi ordered these guitar picks for my son the picks were exactly as described we ordered the blue color which is dark blue with a lighter shiner blue design on top of it it is a heavy duty grade and it is very sturdy he is very pleased with these picks the appearence is pleasing and it is made well very pleased with the quality we will be purchasing more picks in the future highly recommend easy to mount solid grip on guitar only detractor would be that with my guitar at least it hangs kind of far from the wall this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though an acoustic would clear the wall nicely my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar without marring even soft wood i very much prefer this to having it on one of the accident waiting to happen stands on the floor what a great little stand i love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings i also like the fact it folds up taking up very little space when its stored away the rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic so there s no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck it came and it wasn t broken or bad and it held my brother s guitar for a few years until he sold it have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar so it is just used as a pick holder so my picks have some places to go can hold up to picks of thickness i use tortex guitar pick of that thickness it a simple holder that it s really good to make sure that you will not be out of picks when you need then this is my new favorite tuner not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently it works like a champ i don t mean that it works i mean that it works better than any of my other tuners it is super tight it recognizes pitch differences that my ear can t leaving a better tune than my rp or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like i ve got laying around i plan on buying these for all my guitars i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk imports often have threads other than inch sae it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads quick install works like a dream excellent guitar picks of medium hardness picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly if you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more this dunlop pick holder work good for an in expense product it is want i need for travel little hard to put picks in but ok this pedal is very nice it looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great you can just plug it into your keyboard and play it works very well this is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere one note this does not come with any picks one customer said it did but mine did not it has a sticky pad on the back and sticks well to a wood guitar i even moved it once and it still sticks fine it is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out perfect picks very pretty and nice quality they are not too stiff nor are they too soft i would order these again if you enjoy playing guitars then i think you will love this shubb s acoustic guitar deluxe capo it something nice to have around your house and work great thanks to all these are super strings they will last and last and last and give you great sound easy to put on and tune the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set are the perfect balance between weight and confort it fits very well on my guitars fender evh wolfgang ibanez s the cons is that these do not come with vci so expect some flakes when you open the pack this was another filler item for a much larger order i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track simple idea but a good one thanks it s a great pick holder but i m not fond of the sticky background something clip on would have been more useful very clean very bright strings i use these on my strat and it feels good and sounds amazing if you want to use these strings for distortion you re an idiot these are something i could imagine david gilmore using all three of my kids have a guitar they were always losing their picks this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks i m a beginner so i m not very picky on the accessories yet but this was a great package deal for this price shipping was free it arrived in under week from ordering pros padded caselove the backpack featurehas many pocketsfits my takamine jasmine acoustic perfectpicks vary in size and shapestrap was easy to attachcons strap is made from nylon and feels cheap which it is lol some poor stitching in one area of the case shoulder strap exposing the padding i restitched fairly easily i lose picks so easily i needed a pick hold this one sticks well to the guitar locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle so i push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it i might try it somewhere on the strap i m a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play i however am having a ball playing as loud as i want with as much or as little gain as i feel like at the moment with my classic rock guitar headphone amp my rickenbacker sounds just the way i want with as much clarity or with all the smoke as i feel like dialing in for now it is so nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in put in my ear buds and practice for a while anywhere i want anytime i want downside i wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size vox amp and the controls are small hard to read but easy to learn you do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time solution hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive i plan to pick up other versions of the amplug from vox to extend my fun this was a good choice buy one this tuner is easy to use i have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn t seem to be perfect on pitch this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase it serves its purpose doesn t hold as many pick as i expected looking back can t see why i really need it a plastic bag does fine in fact i don t think i ve ever used after the first time i put the picks in it i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag this is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a mixer rack or piano scissor stand the square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading the mic end of the mount works pretty good overall the only problems i found is that the up tube could be to taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer i bought these to fill the dunlop pick holder that i also purchasd nice selection and the price was right this stand holds up my ukulele so yay folded up it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the hola gig bag which i also use and heartily recommend make no mistake this stand is not pretty it feels and looks like cheap plastic but it does the job i like the quality of the picks not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style thanks
234	these guitar strings are nothing special and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be they work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price i was remodeling an old behringer and all i wanted was a fresh shiny set of new strings for playing they sound pretty good best part in my opinion is that they re made in america as well as the majority of fender products if you want to spend the extra money i d stil recommend ernie ball over these or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these fender strings you get what you pay for as far as shipping musician s friend did a great job getting the order out quickly i ll be ordering from musician s friend again in years of using many jim dunlop products made in america or to his standards of quality i ve never broken or worn out the capo i use mine on both and string guitars the spring tension remains strong after several years which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing the only problem i have with them they seem to disappear when i m not looking i have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily not much to say about a guitar strap except i had planned to use it on a simga acoustic without a pin at the neck i ended up using the strap on my strat for the acoustic and this one is on the strat this one doesn t come with a wrap or tie for the nut so it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body if you need to secure one end at the headstock this is not an option it is comfortable though works great for changing guitar strings good build and doesn t look cheap built in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus very happy with it considering the price point i d buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you don t need a hard case great for the knock around uke though the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast i tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn t make much difference i hope it goes away with use the string cutter works like a champ i was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings these work much better they don t cut the string they shear it off i ve done sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double leather ends the color stands out well on the black background available in various colors this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great it alows you to fine tune each string buy it use this on my taylor acoustic electric which does not have a built in tuner love it it hides very nicely on the headstock your audience won t even see it what else can i say it s accurate it works it clamps on really neatly securely it s a great price it has not marred the finish on my taylor s headstock in any way etc i d recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a built in tuner would definitely buy again these are so cool that everyone should have at least one of these even if you don t need one i really and suprisingly like this little gadget it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate it doesn t twist up like my standard black cable does but it will twist a bit over time love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn t just stick right out there if you really want to avoid on stage kinks then you must go wireless it is the only way to avoids twisted cables no matter what type you buy this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion it s worth spending a jackson imo this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on
235	it s not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i m happy a little flimsier than the at but at the price it s good for the price you can t really beat this little amp the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up the little speaker gets kinda muddy but for a bright clean tone it works well the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes but for the money it s a great buy not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a vdc adapter thingie make sure thingie outputs at least ma if you can tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing all workand the distortion control mostlly notnecessary for me but others will find thatcontrol is use ful too it is a cutie and works for fun and u might get loudness around dba onsome frequencies not bad at all even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing a good thing for the price it is worth i ve used d addario s on so many different guitar s the only opinion i can honestly give ya is that they are the best in the studio or on stage they stay in tune and work very well with any pickup you are using i put these on my wife s bass cause she is still learning and with a fender squire it sounds almost as good as a precision fender bass they stay true to the note so she will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time i m obviously not a techie i couldn t understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldn t work until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane a ha to be fair i must explain that the battery was already installed in the tiny little amp when it arrived so i didn t look too closely at it but of course when i couldn t get it to work for me i soon discovered the problem this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes and will astound you with it s capacity to roar out your music when turned up fully and respond immediately to your slightest touch on it s sweet little knobs to sound out your music from there and down to a whisper whenever you require it to the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell no static at all truly an amazing little gadget attractive so portable and does the job of one twice or more of it s size
236	this unit is well constructed switches and knobs feel sturdy the user guide is informative it has a wide tone range i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear it is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set it doesn t have presets you can loop an effects processor thru it i bought one of snark s super tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised it will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio and one on my stage rig buy it it s a great little tuner i couldn t believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable velvety cushioning inside heavy duty outside and a little compartment for picks or capos i can t fit much else in there but i don t really need to a few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze at first i didn t think my ibanez mandolin fit in here but when i finally applied some pressure it went right in now that i ve been using the case for a while it seems broken in and i don t have to fight it so much to get it to close the only downside is that after a few uses the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge i used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it s on the bottom it s not very noticeable but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through i didn t take a star away for that as it s purely cosmetic and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin i can forgive some tape on the edge in this case i still got more than my money s worth this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used i have been a guitarist and bassist for over years and although i have only been playing banjo for a short time this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used the clips look solid and so far they are solid
237	the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables ft measurement worked perfectly you really will not be disappointed with these i ve read where people are using bottle caps instead of these my guitar is more valuable to me than that i suppose because i m not trusting that my expensive gitty won t hit the floor i mean you pay for a quality instrument right why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe i m sorry but that s just idiocy in action this isn t get an upgrade already i play standing up of the time so these are a necessity i have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily but all except one snapped right back together when i first started playing i had a brand new to me guitar hit the floor and the neck break because i didn t use them that s something that should only happen once in your life if at all the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones they were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well i use these strings on my practice guitar because the smaller strings are easier on my fingers i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good i normally buy d addario strings here i buy the or strings this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning when i first started on guitar i put electric ernie ball on my acoustic so i could handle the pain and keep learning then i went to d addario strings i wanted to try these since the under price is good they sound nice they don t sound as crisp as the d addario strings they sound more mellow and not as bold they are and i prefer those to the other strings out there i can t say i love them or i hate them i will probably stick with d addario since i don t find any difference in them i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon for the price i would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them i don t think they sound bad and if they do it did not cost much to test them enjoy i have used ernie ball strings on my les paul for quite a while slinkys mostly i recently bought a yamaha fg s and quickly found that the high e string had a very tinny tone i searched the net to see if this was comon with this model alas i found that it is so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night wow what a difference first the tone is much softer on the e string second the action feels much more comfortable on strings thru the strings that came on the guitar were yamaha light strings but they were very stiff especially the b string after a hour of playing with the earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable both tonally and physically not sure how they will last time will tell good strings i would recommend them
238	to all heavy music guitarist i highly recommend this one try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star i got a pair of these strings in early august i still have them but being as doubtful as i am i just bought an extra pair from this seller who shipped amazingly fast it got here in about days any ways the strings stay bright for a long time don t have not lost there color yet rusted after a little more than four months and they are everything a guitar player looks for in strings i do a lot of string bends and these have just held up to it i have a b c rich sob avenge so i can t tell you what its like with a tremolo but i just like them i have tried out ghs first act dunlop and d addario s and these are the only ones that have last for so long with out showing any signs of significant wear i gave this a star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar i replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing i did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar this was a terrific deal my son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic so i decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great i really and suprisingly like this little gadget it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate it might just be my pickups or my strings but if you set the bass above seven or so the bass gets fairly fizzy on the e string the effects loop is useless and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals but that s good news because with this amp you don t need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive so if you ever do use a driven distorted tone you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp i cant play real guitars but i did buy this for rock band this is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way this has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it i even use it when im drumming i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
239	i bought these because they were an add on offer and i m glad i did i don t play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass these are a little too soft for guitar check out the dunlops but i m going to make sure i have some of these around too i ve used all sorts of strings over the years and generally aim for ghs strings however these power slinky strings are great i ve not broken one yet and the is a good gauge heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings depends on what your looking for is this a pog nope but it has some tricks up it s leave for the price the only con i can give is when playing chords when dropping down like a drop d it doesn t always sound grant bar chords work a little better perfect for re stringing your guitar very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings the price was right too this is a must have tool and isn t cheap like most of the plastic ones out there the nice thing about this one is it cuts off excess with ease just looks better trimmed neatly star product i use it to wind my strings i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast very easy to use i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well i like s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the power slinky name they were a little too much for the squier bullet i put them on even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck while i had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness more metal moving over a guitar pickup hotter sound more gain and on a stratocaster more glass and bell like tones i ve used ernie ball s slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound fun fact get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery there is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound ringing out of your amplifier a little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent i ve been using a very cheap amp for too long and decided to try a tube amp this thing gave me chills the first time i played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after i unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first you wasted our money on this which turned to dang this thing sounds good guess it s ok with me as i begin to shred on it with my p equipped les paul the tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic and for watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue though i don t think it is loud enough for a drummer it has line out and speaker out which is great and this amp has nice build quality plus it s on sale right now so snatch one before they re all gone i would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device note that this thing takes about seconds to warm up so you can t just flip it on and play instantly not a huge deal just turn it on before you get situated i wish they could have crammed a inch speaker in it though the inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient so stop thinking about it and just go buy it these strings have a powerful tone for lead work however they re not on the bendy side which is great for rhythm work the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm if you need an overall great set of strings get these you won t regret it worked for me got no complaints over these very smooth and lasted me a while love ernie ball strings they are the only ones i get
240	wonderful and inexpensive strap i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems well made and easy to adjust i have the small version but for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more i used in all my concerts and its excellent recommended i bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips i check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine the it is very good for a stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner picks tuning forks capo etc and the price was very good best i could find for this time of hard case the only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if i have a gun in case if you need basic protection of your guitar this will do very well i do not know if it will fit other guitars i have heard that some are too long for it but for the fender stat it works just great this little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size the locking knobs do their job without fail and i don t have to over crank them to get them to hold i use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer recording interface and all the other stuff i use for recording it adjust perfect for vocals and i drop it down if i want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup same with my violins i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup the base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way you must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction it will stand securely in any direction i set it where i want it then just swing it out of the way till i need it i have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics it s just more accessible on the desk this would work fine for drummers i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies thanks not the greatest pedal gives a really broken sound there is no mid way on this pedal either it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing the octave is a joke having said all that i could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance i got this for my epi sheraton ii pros it fits perfectly it s fur lined and has a decent sized internal compartment it s solid and the hardware is sturdy it has one locking latch out of five but nothing that would stop a real thief it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground it s relatively thin cons it s heavy the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle it has some made in china characteristics i ve had several cases and this is one of the nicest on a personal level i d prefer it didn t say epiphone on the outside but since it does it s a good place to hide a gibson wow this little amp packs tons of tone sound hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully the clean channels are really clean the dirty channels are just plain nasty watts is enough power to blow your socks off lots of bang for the buck here my favorite picks can t go wrong with tortex the only habit i have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so i have to buy like a ton of them
241	accurate little accessory only works with guitars it seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar i don t know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments or for uses other than tuning but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio there s a slight hiss too but i enjoyed listening to it while playing and when you attach the headphones it works great amazine that it works off a v battery yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect i went all out and got a roland cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects but that costs x or more as much i am in the process of returning it look at the picture of it next to a coke can that s what it looks like some people complained that the handle doesn t work who cares the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too but that s sort of what you re getting super usb mic i use this when i broadcast from streetjelly com i set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal just make sure you have all your mic levels set to not clip and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a practice cable i can honestly tell a difference that difference being silence no abnormal hissing or popping that i got from my other cheaper cables this isn t the top of the line monster but still a step up from what i d been using i ll definitely upgrade my longer cables to monster and may even see how the expensive one sounds a short one st of course i gave it a star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks but this ft cord is taller than i am which means it s about tall it s a great product for the money exspecially if it s just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp it s short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working i ve owned a half dozen led music stand lights over the years this one puts them all in the shade pun intended sorry the led bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern the light is concentrated in the desired area and doesn t spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights the little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when it s pointed back at the music the light is two level normal and bright normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater the fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of stand light bulbs is a definite plus if you need to put a color filter over it you don t have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter the light spread is so smooth and consistent that i don t have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with two head stand lights the gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well the included ac adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights the included zipper case is fairly big and bulky but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag it has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light and a small pocket for the ac adapter it s hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket but there s plenty of room for it in the case i don t know about battery life yet but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the ac adapter usually an optional purchase this light is a bit large compared to other led stand lights but it s so good that i don t really care i ve gotten years of service from mighty bright lights and i expect the same from this even if this one doesn t last i ll keep buying more these are great cables but i gave it a four because i after playing the cheap rotosound cables i learned they are just as good and are only bucks still a great cable and these sound slightly better than rotosound but thats if you are super observant because their isnt much of a difference i made the mistake of thinking i could save forty bucks and get by with the shure pg i m no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp rather than a p a whatever the reason the pg simply doesn t have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the roland cube peavey amps i try to employ it with i use a adapter with the xlr connector that comes with the mic when i borrow a shure sm mic from someone the difference is instant and dramatic it s a far more efficient i e louder mic producing a full clear sound and without additional pre amplification demonstrating why it s the most popular microphone in the world for five bucks extra i can t fathom a reason for avoiding the sm s the version with an on off switch it s a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick up of private comments by indiscreet band members and even if you re an instrumentalist it may be wiser to select the sm over the sm the former mic is a little more ostentatious but it s also slightly more adaptable and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non musical sounds above all the sm has proven itself to be the sherman tank of microphones simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller perhaps a good point unless it s in reference to amazon prime which is the shure sm of commerce competitive prices no postage easy returns but anyone who returns an sm probably had no business buying it in the first place they are the populous drones of the industry invariably purchased by professionals who know first hand what they re getting reliability and virtual indestructibility in fact it s the very popularity of the sm that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators consumers require choice but with the shure sm there need be none i love this cable they look good and are well made too an incre iacute ble guitar cable i really recomended it i have the ft and this one ft try one the tabs broke off right out of the package the other reviews made me aware this may happen an easy fix with some super glue and for the price who cares if i have to fix it it is accurate and very easy to use other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money highly recommend
242	bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well product is as described and fits mic perfect will buy more in future i bought a cheep violin to decide if i would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping the peg drops really helped keep it in tune i wouldn t have been able to do it without the drops strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar they improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out they did nothing to help my over braced gibson j though phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap it s ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected i would recommend going a little higher price it also arrived cracked glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin if you are afraid to disturb your neighbors when you are practicing violin just buy it it will put the sound down it really works for an item you can t go wrong i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone let me start off saying that you cannot go wrong buying any of the series of mighty bright music stand lamps the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design and the carrying case makes it very portable fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to works great the unit uses three aa batteries i started off using batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours i prefer to use the foot adapter cord i am an older person who has old eyes sometimes lower c and lower a look alike mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue the clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe however the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on top some comments have indicated that when plugging the ac adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected the unit i purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip to confirm this on your unit disconnect the ac adapter from the wall and from the light load batteries into the clip and turn on the light finally with the ac adapter still disconnected from the wall outlet plug the cable into the base the light should go out if it doesn t your unit is not isolating the batteries from the ac adapter and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the ac adapter is plugged in it fits almost anywhere and looks cool holds all my drumstick and whatnot i would recommend it to anyone that needs a place for there sticks
243	i got this for one of my guitar students whose mom just wanted a cheap case for her acoustic guitar now let s be clear this is easily worth but it is a very bare bones gig bag it will protect your instrument to a degree it only has minimal padding and is probably good enough for any beginner instrument one of my students has one of those esteban infomercial guitars which is pretty low quality but not terrible and not unplayable and the gig bag for that instrument has no padding whatsoever i only give stars because for a little more money it s possible to get something which i feel is noticably better i have a musician s friend acoustic gig bag that i paid for a few years ago and it s well made and probably has twice the padding of this thing so this isn t bad it s worth the price it s put together just fine but it only just barely serves its purpose of protecting your instrument and i d never trust this with an instrument of any value gig bags can be a good alternative to a hard case if space or weight are a concern this isnt a bad choice but just be aware of what you re getting i really like the idea of a pick pocket in the strap in fact i like it so well that when i replace the strap on my other guitar i ll make sure it also has the same type of strap saves your thumb on the strum grips nicely in your fingers but not on the strings a totem of rock and roll in your grip i needed a small capo for my mandolin and so i purchased this little guy works great though i have to put it on at that st fret and then move it up to where i need it i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it tried too light and high and too deep not good for popping but is right in the middle perfect i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing and it seems to have made my fingertips slick so i have a hard time holding on to picks when i use them on upstrokes i m sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem but it s more fun to blame the pick these picks were no different from picks without the gator grip imho but gorilla snot worked beautifully idiot proof compact extremely sturdy all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts runs on aa batteries features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperpyle pro pct are test tone function which sends a known volume signal down the line very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment intermittent issue indication this is what made me choose this model if there s even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot my only complaints the a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife quite frustrating used my dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw and managed to get it out there s an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous luckily i have no need for the clip i used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw no rubber feet on the bottom metal enclosure battery cover screw sliding around and marring whatever it sits on i stuck some re purposed rubber feet on the bottom after the few problem solving situations mentioned above this thing is a star product too bad they couldn t go the extra step to make it star out of the box
244	i usually play my jazz bass fingerstyle but there are songs where i prefer a pick especially when i need speed and accuracy until i found the hard wedgie rubber pick i used a heavy fender pick but didn t like the sharp pick sound very much i bought a set of soft medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i m really happy with the results i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie s really nice for my jazz bass i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars but the wedgie s are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments i prefer the mm wedgie picks since the mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes but that s entirely subjective i d love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday but it still works very well for me disclaimers obtained free as part of amazon s vine program tested on ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players yes this tuner is for you i tested this diminutive tuner on sopranino ohana soprano pono concert kala string tenor pono it s tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there it s a bit problematic on the sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the top tuning is easy just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen if it s red you re off if it s green you re in tune when you re off little bars will display by the note letter left if you re low right if you re high tune in the direction needed until there s one bar on each side of the note and the note s name turns green quick and easy i ve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it s dead accurate as others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock but it s held together fine so far and i ve had it for weeks i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly i have had enough the main problem with this tuner is the usability the tuner has a poor display is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key tuning with it can be condensed into one word frustrating the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings especially so when the guitar is much out of tune the poor display is dark with no build in light and has poor visibility at angles too combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner yes it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display which is cents enough said i bought a new tuner the seiko sat for a bit more money that this the main differences between sat and the ca sat has a build in light ca does not ca has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a deg angle sat does not sat has a auto and manual mode ca has auto sat displays the octave of the note e g e e etc ca displays only displays the alphabet e for all oactaves sat has a numerical display for the cents off ca does not the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be i purchased these picks because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band we play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise they don t make that annoying plastic to metal sound but they are very flexible i need to have alot of pick speed these slow me down way to much the other reviews i read stated that these were like rigid picks but no they are not too bad as i had high hopes good picks if you don t have to tremolo pick not very good if do have to i should have read the reviews carefully it s definitely something different but not sturdy at all rubber bits come off as you strum and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers ouch i m much happier with my friday the th glow in the dark picks that is an experiment that worked and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming why don t you use your fingers i ve owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value i m and weigh there are numerous adjustment angles that i can switch to and be comfortable and i m not concerned about the legs bending the photo makes them look weaker than they are

246	i own several of these and general buy from gls direct but i needed some quick and had other orders from amazon so i got them hear at same price gls is great quality and durable i use there and cords and have never been disappointed this is what it is a super cheap mono cable it should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc for the price and intent i almost gave it stars but it s not a star cable it s a fair quality ultra cheap cable stars seems about right yes this is almost exactly what i wrote about the other hosa cable i reviewed i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap sm wannabe from radio shack i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then i can easily position for use with a generous inch reach definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient just what i needed i bought this cable in an emergency situation one where i was on the road needed a great cable and didn t have access to roll my own using what would ve been essentially the same parts i exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio and in critical places of my live setup the cable itself is top shelf quiet and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect as an instrument cable this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch making it worth it to go for the cable as a bass or guitar player if you don t like being tied down i used this as part of a keyboard rig where it was perfect on all levels quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum the highs were crystal the bass clear connection is solid i am not a gold fanatic but these are excellent great warranty and a reputation that holds value these are real deal pro cables as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price but not necessarily a superior build or sound which is why i didn t walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster s and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead i tried it for ipad it kinda wobbles up and down it has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my ipad i only recommend it for something light weight there s better ones out there see my review on the music stand that comes with a solid extension arm
247	sturdy mic clip on a budget mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence will purchase more as needed first of all let me say from some of the pictures i have seen posted of this pop filter when put on a yeti mic stand the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured this is a design flaw not with the pop filter but with the yeti stand as this filter has been around long before the yeti came out blue or a clever do it yourself person could easily fix it by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well since i have mine hanging upside down on a boom stand attached to a blue radius shock mount this is not an issue for me but i will say it is a problem blue should fix i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems i am not going to knock any stars off because i m reviewing the filter itself which is superb and how it works for me now for the meat this is a studio grade high quality product all metal except for the two tightening knobs the dual screen design eliminates any plosives p s and b s for example better than any screen i have used so far this is especially true when the screen distance is about an inch from the yeti capsule screen and you are to inches away from the unit itself which i have found to be the yeti s sweet spot in the cardioid pattern next the silk screened blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot if you place it in front of the capsule area i like the idea of a metal screen especially if you are transporting it you won t have to worry about snagging or runs as you do with the cloth filters speaking of old cloth filters i have a neumann which is about years old a very nice screen as well but it does not cut the pops as well as the blue especially if you get closer to the mic and screen also when reading copy or maybe music i can see over and through the blue filter much better than the round inch jobs like the neumann you can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily cheaper filters i have used in the past will creep back into unwanted positions the blue behaves the blue pop is absolutely transparent no muffling as with foam filters the curved design of the blue filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all the screen is a solid build as are all of the blue products i have used so far it also fits the look of the yeti and radius shock mount like a glove surprisingly i paid a little over on amazon a real bargain in my mind for such high quality this filter is for all the blue microphones by the way and i am going to use it on my entire collection of mics addendumif you need to use the yeti as a table top mic especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter any brand i would suggest buying asamson samd md desktop mic stand which works great for this set up i use these with my mxr effects pedals and they are awesome top quality i would recommend these to anyone sincerely doc i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn t know the clip didn t come with it so i had to order a clip later nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks it is also rubber in construction so it won t crack like the other low quality clips it is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is good i would recommend it it is a nice clip works for my mics i don t like the soft opening it makes you not easy to put back the mics this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one and it is not a toy don t be misled by the price this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics and while it may not be a marshall stack it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town the tone has been fairly pure although with a mike at least i can also get some pops crackles and squeals this is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp so the honey tone is not at fault in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input i ve used it with a high impedance mike astatic jt a low impedance mike behringer xm and electric guitar fender stratocaster it handles these without noticeable signal loss what is this amp exactly my guess is that danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox added a watt amplifier circuit and put the whole shebang into a retro case the result is quite appealing and the overall look and feel is one of quality the case is solid albeit plastic the three controls volume tone and overdrive while not detented have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components the input inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid someone in danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit s leather strap though it is more decorative than useful if you can operate an overdrive stompbox then you know how to work this amp the volume control is obvious the tone control alters the bass treble mix but not very significantly in my opinion the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree the instructions describe sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you as i said this is small but really not a toy i ve personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it s so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable and when i decide that i m good enough to panhandle in penn station this baby is going with me
248	this item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars i tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in position the short extension in the picture is not on the unit i received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered i would purchase this unit again and again it is a good piece and a good deal this amp did a good job for its rating it was my backup amp for a qsc gx i sold it after using it for about a year or so you can t have too many adapters if you are a sound guy this handy gadget converts a balanced or unbalanced mic cable to an unbalanced jack simple and it works i ve got a couple in my kit and they do what they say and come in handy when working with unknown equipment i didn t need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units i ve used i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars i ve been using them for years and never have been let down by the quality and sound excellent equipment for the price i paid can t beat what i got have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them it s been several years now and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment one doesn t get much better than d addario strings in my opinion they re twice as clear as martin strings and the exps just last forever i like the standard phosphor bronze just as well and use those as a less expensive alternative i certainly recommend d addario nylon strings on classical guitars i ve heard no other string that has the crisp clean rich sound of this brand of strings i ve used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand but always come back to this one different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use i prefer this mid range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone any lighter and the guitar sounds tinny any heavier and i fear strings putting undue stress on the neck these are just right
249	this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from the pencil condenser are questionable they have picked up outside noise like birds etc but with a decent bit of white noise but i may have had them running a bit hot too the strange clamps have worked well for me this works just as stated now i can plug my mic in either way and it gives me more versitility well it s made nicely but output is not strong sensitivity brings notes together on the bright side but there s little ciean sustain i m going to work with it more that s compressor s some of the stands i have purchased are hollow some are solid at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue i wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box the shure xlr female to male adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit i ve got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to now this one as pictured is the mono version which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced jack if you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable this adapter will not work for you you ll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter i notice mixed reviews here i suppose when an item sells for instead of there may be a potential for quality control issues but hey buy of them and if even one turns out to be bad you re still way ahead on the deal seems to me as good as any connector i ve ever bought this mic stand does everything it says it will and is adjustable in every conceivable way in fact the boom has a really nice adjusting lever making it easy to loosen and tighten the only drawback i found is the tripod configuration of its feet making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances especially when you re emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on i would much prefer a round base other than that it makes for a great home garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin it nuff said
250	i chose this rating because i found this product superior to other similar products i have purchased in the past this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price i used this on my wall mount u rack to hold my modem and router near my switch as an added bonus it has vent holes on the bottom which not only allow for heat dissipation but also make really convenient ziptie tie down locations i ll definitely be buying more of these this item really speaks for itself it is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop the base is nice and weighted but not too heavy to be unwieldy it s a solid piece that serves its purpose and offers convenience for anyone looking to place a microphone on their desk i would recommend you grab a shock mount with this if you don t already have one as it transfers vibrations though the stand but that is honestly to be expected i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it on the plus side it is quiet sturdy has a reasonable footprint does not suck tone and it is passive but the feel was not quite right for me even with the adjustable tension i couldn t lock it in to where i wanted it i m very used to the ernie ball pedals and i also like the new morley volume plus but to be fair pedal tension is a pretty personal factor and this might easily be a star product for you this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows smooth midrange and crisp highs for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production the sound is unbelievable especially at this price for under twenty dollars this pyle pro mike can t be beat one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam dr portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device the tascam d is known for this noise issue but usually not when using the xlr input tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely it s pretty sensitive the metronome will drive you crazy it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible think of the most sterile electronic clicks beeps you can and then add nails on chalkboard for good measure there are much better sounding metronomes out there i bought this korg for the tuner function and that s about all i ll use it for
251	this is a pretty good stand for the price i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms i have the dr pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is bt for the price this is a good value this little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such but don t expect it to last forever as is typical with behringer products at least it s cheap though i just wish it had a power switch much better than the more economical one s sold i should have gotten the foot but you live and learn my studio is small but it needs to wrap around my desk and go into my sound proof closet it matches my awesome at microphone ino u wana buy one of those cheap pedals from ebay n the likes right nope cause when yeh doits gonna flak out after about the th push you do on it listen to the voice of experience grrr hahahthese pedals are frikn tanks heavy duty all the way and have a polarity switch and yeh there s alota keyboards out thereu gota have that perc it s worth it just suck it up n get the thing and if you still need a momentary dsp switch then buy the lil jobbut only use it in life or death situations hahah they have a really cheap plastic switch thats destined to die no matter what at least the previous i bought did ouch so is that like hail mary s for that confession works with myon stage ks classic double x keyboard standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by on stage as wellon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackworks as advertised you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it these are great patch cables especially for the price they don t suck any tone they are reliable i ve had mine for years and are really great for players on a budget just make sure you get this when you get the tascam i didn t run it without this power source that seems too ghetto they should just jack the price to what it would be with this and viola but what do i know i ve used this pedal with a casio px keyboard for about weeks now pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards polarity switch i was using a yamaha fc with an older keyboard but the fc does not work properly with the casio keyboards it s a tip negative polarity and the privia requires a tip positive polarity so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed thankfully the sp has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard cord is long enough con build quality is slightly less than the fc the fc has a smooth action made in japan but the sp had some problems with the metal spring squeaking some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking the sp also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal overall it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals this is a nice pick holder especially for the price it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use i had to send my first one back the second one is working fine so far i ve noticed it works better with some daws than others also if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software it works great with reaper my epiphone sst classic didn t have the strap pin so i took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place as i don t want to do another hole to my guitar i left it there but i m afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground so i bought these fender strap blocks and i use it on my two epiphone guitars that i can t use the planet waves strap lock with my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird they work great i would buy these again i needed a new stand for my home studio so i thought i was cutting corners when i purchased this one as it turns out this stand is practically indistinguishable from mybelmonte orchestra stand deluxein construction and material quality that stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review the stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians and is stable enough to use outside the rest tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments in fact i have attached analeratec universal tablet mountto hold an ipad with sufficient room left over for a page copy of thethe new real book volume and it holds those rock steady another feature that i like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand s footprint are not problems bottom line this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price i am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever i need another stand this is the model i will purchase this is a really good patch cable fits into different brand of pedals well and is really flexible with out feeling like its cheap i was able to weave it in and out of the pedaltrain pro no problem in fact i ve order more sets of these for the rest of my pedals highly recommended well made works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic i bought this cable in an emergency situation one where i was on the road needed a great cable and didn t have access to roll my own using what would ve been essentially the same parts i exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio and in critical places of my live setup the cable itself is top shelf quiet and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect as an instrument cable this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch making it worth it to go for the cable as a bass or guitar player if you don t like being tied down i used this as part of a keyboard rig where it was perfect on all levels quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum the highs were crystal the bass clear connection is solid i am not a gold fanatic but these are excellent great warranty and a reputation that holds value these are real deal pro cables as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price but not necessarily a superior build or sound which is why i didn t walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster s and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead these are the only picks i use they re fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent they arrived on time and i will order them again this is an always on pedal for me it s at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe it really allowed me to wake up the board and i like the fact that i can adjust it on the fly if i don t totally agree with my tone that night very nice built like a brick every guitarist and bassist needs one of these whether you run a pedal board or not these sticks are solid hickory which is insanely durable and sounds great for classic rock and punk rock drums these sticks are weight and sound matched so each pair will sound and feel almost identical i feel like this picks dirt off my guitar strings better than the taylor cloth i also have in the case this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment i tried purchasing a soft case that had the seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar it didn t it was way too short for my seagull s coastline this is a sturdy case that looks good too
252	i thought i could take the smell i couldn t otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding the case is nice too but everything smells like the chinese rubber smell at harbor freight tools sulfur i tried airing it out for a week with no success if you have no sense of smell get one this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested great portability for the price however having read reviews across multiple sites i too am a victim of the horrible glue smell that so many others have complained about i really liked the guitar so i purhcased it from two separate retailers but had to return both due to the horrific smell i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smell free case and they sent a case but it stunk too it s a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars don t expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won t be disappointed that said i find it useful for composing on the road heck it even sounds better than my big guitars in an odd way for certain songs nice sturdy and portable case not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask action is adequate for practice with a little tweaking it s actually good quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely acoustic and electric but not at the same time haha i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon i wasn t planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar the way the military palletizes all of its cargo i figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it but i took the chance anyway it arrived intact and ready to play the strings are a bit cheap but the guitar itself is well made and has a really nice rich tone i was planning on giving it away when i left but i am shipping it home instead and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home but it is worth it this one has worked out so well i am taking a chance on a string soon to arrive in theater this does what it says it does anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole this is easy to install i just losened the strings and inserted the o port my washburn d s will never leave home without one
253	this is the most awesome loop pedal ever does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered i ve had this little amplifier for a few weeks and i couldn t ask for a better practice amp it s amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room but it ll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds it s rugged and portable and it s fun to play around with some of the effects the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus to everyone who plays flat picking guitar i m sure you all have your own choice of pick do you even remember why you picked the style you use somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain very big very cushioned i didn t notice that it helped all that much with the weight of my bass but helped a little almost thought it was a little too cumbersome kind of bit into my neck a little besides looking cool they are for sure not going to malfunction you have to pull up on the tab to get the strap to release they spin nice good locks i like them better then the dunlops i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar i would have given this item stars but even fully extended it is about too short as for the quality of the strap i love the look and feel of the leather it has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer my cents in summary i think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric this strap would work much better if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap reviews described strap as soft and weathered which sounded good to me actual description is a blasted design which is what you get strap is quite stiff but i d say it s worth the price i would have preferred something different this is a fun pick i play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought i d give this a try its great i love the tone of this pick striking strings i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings more organic than plastic picks yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard i think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you ll be fine its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument worth a try
254	love this strap it s a good quality strap and i have three of them being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild just go browse a crafts store and see what you can find to make it yours i can t let on what i ve done to mine because they are originals but you can have a blast making a one of a kind of your own come on we re artists so show off your creativity the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at yes does it work well if you can securely close the little gap between the at and the shock mount then yes there is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the at only other thing is that the colors don t really match up well but i don t really care its a good shock mount ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one i don t really use mine since i have carpet on the floors that doesn t like the mic stand shake too much i gig a lot and since i am a grey haired musician i need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing this seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss the back rest support is nice too for the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country great price for good mike i did not want to spend a lot to start i got a good mike at a great price for the price this is the perfect pop filter really good length and the clamp is decent hope it will last me awhile microphone is quite good for such price the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones recommend for small budget studios it connected well in the nady smps x phantom power unit i bought i ll update how i hook it up check love it nice mic to record acoustical instruments more words word word word word word word word word word word this was exactly what i needed for the price range i could afford in a crunch my old mic just wasn t cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles it is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals it is recording my guitar beautifully i ve even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar i ve set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole slightly back and sing into the top at about degrees and back a little i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean i m very happy with this unit price considered but i d have to pay a lot more to improved on it i ll probably get another one i kind of wish i d have bought that combo kit i use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over its worked great very happy with it its not a quality mic but it its a good mic for the money some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter i bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but i have a completely different view the at is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser it is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts but there are a bunch of better mics near this price two that come to mind are the mxl v g and studio projects b stay away from the studio projects c both exceptional microphones for the price although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing the mxl a a lot of people have claimed the studio projects c sounds like the neumann u it doesn t the mxl a however sounds very similar and is easily the best ldc mic under with that being said the at is not a bad microphone but it is not great to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone although to be fair i have a lot of experience in pro audio and production so i maybe a bit overly critical one thing is for sure though there are definitely better mics in or near this price range
255	i bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo it works good on all of them and is very accurate i also used it to tune my uncle s mandolin for him because he couldn t find his tuner other than that theres not much else to say p i haven t used the metronome so i can t comment on that i m just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best i like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound the price is right as far as banjo strings go these are a good bang for the buck or were when i got them d addario makes a pretty consistant product i ve used them on everything over the years although i prefer certain brands for other things strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well if you buy a cheap instrument here do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they ll be strung with trash if it s a lower end instrument from china even if you re starting out you should tell the difference right away
256	it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights i really wanted to use it halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn t want it out on the porch next year this fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up the fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy it s ok but not the best fog machine out there i m never playing another guitar without these locks after my custom telecaster fell the neck went out of wack i had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again that s every musician s nightmare i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps schaller kept coming up i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use one issue you may run into is the nut running loose that s not a problem with the scaller locks it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party upon installation and testing the unit blew a fuse going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing if not i ll be returning mine will update update radio shack carries the correct fuses for this unit upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected leaks a bit while using so dont stand under it but most on these things leak anyway great for video photo work or even theater it won t handle well at a large space if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation what i ll be using it fordj work to show laser beams and light beamsvideo work use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site that s what you are seeing in movies photo work not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an iso
257	this is a really nice product for the price when fully extended it becomes a little tippy but i don t fully extend the legs which gives it a wider more stable base otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel nice product much better than the more economical one s sold i should have gotten the foot but you live and learn my studio is small but it needs to wrap around my desk and go into my sound proof closet it matches my awesome at microphone i enjoy using it and its helpful when you wanna use it to hold up your sheet music to a viewable point and your books too i recommend it i really like this tuner it works very well once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner ie the moving black squares to no longer move then tuning is a simple and accurate thing it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it it cause a few bucks but i think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons that it is worth it what else can be said about aquila high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best even if you have a very cheap ukulele adding these strings can turn a toy uke into something that wont embarrass you i use aquila and martin strings in my ukuleles the aquila for most performances and the martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional hawaiian sound as the aquilas are a tad heavier than martin even if this if you only have one ukulele and you won t for long you can t go wrong with these strings the price was right so i got one does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music books don t do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time even some smaller ones strictly for practice heres where you get those strings i got sets of strings on amazon for the local music store wanted for set it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments it works better than my piano i can trust that i will be in tune
258	works just fine except the little knob that s supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings the little pins or whatever it doesn t grip onto mine i have an acoustic jasmine takkamine so i had to get out pliers from my toolbox but that s okay one size doesn t always fit all good price the material it s made of is good and it holds the guitar the only things i don t like are each of the corners has a cap the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off the part at the bottom that looks like a u used to hold the guitar it spins it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one hm i received this i opened this i ve used it i also use it this product seems to be a pretty good product construction is fine and you can set it up in seconds it holds my bass just fine and the swiveling bottom is not an issue for me i don t know why some people hate it the rubberized neck holder protects the wood and the strap keeps the guitar in place for under and prime eligible what more can you ask for the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package all picks were there saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings good deal and i will purchase again these patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most as far as i can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all they stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time if you have a double bass kick pedal i highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company i like this product the screen is big and easily read the meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle the note sharp or flat and by the background color going green to red it takes seconds to hear the string but then it locks right in for all notes even the low e it s really easy to use and i m really happy with it its so much better than my korg ca the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel it takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position an additional swivel would make it perfect i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn accurate easy to use clear display and much smaller than i anticipated yet it s quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar at home or on the go i can t see the need for another tuner i am worried that i will damage my instruments if they are left standing around this will allow me to show off and protect them it s semi secure on carpeting or hard floor but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand the bottom piece has no way to lock in place and although with the guitar on it it is more stable i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall this one meh not worth the purchase in my opinion booooooooo better than i expect i going to order more very stable easy to assemble and a nice price not perfect but a solid stand prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do and the bottom part that holds the guitar isn t fixed so it s good and bad good because it ll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do sometimes it just swings around annoyingly speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet these hold up great year round i will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don t fall onto my baby grand i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well yes there many banjos and some with more frills there is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely i see no flaws on my banjo i did not have the problem with the th string machine being to tight as others i bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was bucks cheaper with free shipping if i could give it more than stars i would i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either a keeper for sure this pack of guitar patch cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable spaghetti mess these are well made cables with degree connectors which is exactly what we needed highly recommended cfh bought stand as a gift for my son s acoustic guitar he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand can t go wrong for the price i bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my fender acoustic these are easy to install using the instructions or without these are also sturdy and look very good this is great if you have to put your guitar down but don t want to put it in its case i bought this for my brother for a christmas gift when we got him a guitar he never used it but not because of anything to do with the actual product this strap is comfortable has plenty of room to expand it to fit and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes i really like it item arrived on time and as described my son loves this polish cleaner he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny they glisten when he uses this to polish them great product not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive no assembly instructions were included in the packaging i ve never owned something like this before so that was annoying luckily some nice pictures were posted on the web page and i was able to figure it out from there once i got it put together and placed my beloved guitar in the thing i got happier it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish i d recommend this stand to others but be aware of shipping tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still this is the nd tuner like this that i have purchased it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar the battery lasts a long time as well which is not true with all little tuners like this one all in all i am very happy with this purchase small price to pay to be in tune i would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument easy to take apart to put together to store and pretty stable when in use not the cheapest but worth the money strong and won t tip price is very affordable i own several and have had no trouble with them buy it and you will see no much to these things but they are cheap and they work great in the studio they shipped quickly and didn t break the bank this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine i am using it for my primary rig setup and i can t tell the different between this and some other cables recommended everest ez series shoulder rest for violin is very good deal if you are learning to play a violin it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time it s okay i ve bought stands for less that were more balanced and sturdy and the little safety strap is a nuisance more than a help not cheap as far as pics are concerned but it s definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then if you re new it helps you find what you like if you re experience you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound it s hard not to love a cord that carries electrons all the way to the end not sure what other than complete failure would take stars away capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary this one has a very strong spring so i am hoping i lossens up with use you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good its a nice stand cheap but should suffice i wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers these are great tuners and they look great i ve never had a lot of interest in locking tuners except on my floyd rose guitars what a great price and product bought two of these so i can keep my guitars handy and i love them really love having the rubber strap to secure the neck in the event of a mishap the wide frame legs make the stand extremely sturdy and love that it can come apart easy if i want to pack it up this stand is very stable and easy to put together works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over this was a great strap i used it on my guitar for months and it s so strong that it s tough to take off i m buying another one for my bass this is more of a like it or hate kind of item if it doesn t work you hate it if it works there s nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it well built not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect sound simple to use great variety of uses for it i like the layout of controls as well only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it s on the right side i d prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals other then that nothing i d change loyal joyo pedal user they ve got a great product for the price point i ve two of these stands on one of them the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand you ll see that the base of the tubing is welded there mine lost its weld so the tubing is not secure to the grey base they separate i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor update glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand beware and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in wait for it china that may explain why it failed but glen ingles could have offered to replace it i guess he doesn t want me to buy any more of his products or refer others to his products well that s his policy that s okay he s got competition and i ll be purchasing from them instead great grip lasts a good long while terrific trippy pearl tones and azures my all time fave hip hip hooray any guitarist knows how one of these works clamp it on the head turn it on and tune i ve tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass my only real complaint is that it often takes seconds to register the note it s getting it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well the low e on my bass will occasionally register as a b rd harmonic for example in general the dullest means of plucking the string finger instead of pick will give the quickest and most glitch free pitch all in all it s a handy little tool to have in the gig bag works good nothing special i have to say i disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell my big nose can t confirm that maybe they corrected the problem if one exited love it fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate a must have for any musician the cry baby has proven itself since the s it is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock it takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level i bought this amp to replace a squier sp that came with my guitar the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button i couldn t afford a bunch of pedals but i wanted some effects so i could get cool sounds from my electric guitar i saw the reviews for this little amp on amazon and decided to give it a try it is awesome for such a small amp the output is plenty loud for practicing at home and it runs on batteries too so i can take it anywhere the effects are better than i d hoped for this is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer but for an intermediate level guitarist like me who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family this is the amp to get it has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus flanger phaser or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay i m one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that i have the time i don t need the deafening stacks that the kids like i love this amp i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine it hasn t seen heavy use it wasn t supposed to it sits in a corner of the living room holds the guitar securely and doesn t cause problems although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious and my yo neighbor was convinced for a year that i was drunk and wailing away on the guitar at am at least that s what she told the police this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musician s gear stand they might actually be the same stand under different names the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping if i were to buy a stand again i would still get this one because it s available under prime the other one isn t that gives this stand more value the stand is very easy to set up the lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar this took a little getting used to but it does work very well the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems given the very low price this is an excellent choice for a living room stand if you re on the road or performing you might need something a bit different but i can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself i ve used these for years acoustic and electric very hard to beat i like the feel and texture of these pics they do the job brilliantly so these are heavy strings that work well i did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough i m a guitarist with a passion for blues so it was only a matter of time before i was going to pick up the harmonica i almost went with some of the cheaper options but i am extremely pleased with my decision it sounds gorgeous very full and clear and i ve already been able to start bending some notes which i understand i notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas as a blues guitarist i was tempted to buy a harmonica in d or a that when played in second position would allow me to play along with blues songs in a or e two of the most common blues keys especially among the songs i like to play the second position for the harp in c is g not terribly common however i think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in c since many of the beginner songs are in c and the c major scale should be very familiar to most musicians in other words as i m exploring the notes they make a lot of sense to me at this price i won t mind buying a d or a when the time comes it s not like i m already at a level where i m dying to play those songs anyway and if i need to there are a couple of songs i ve found in g e g work song by butterfield that song along should keep my practicing for a long time if you are still reading this review then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp add it to your cart works great just clip it on and jam out forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one you ll be happier trust me ever since i saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used jazz picks and after having tried them that he simply couldn t use an other pick i decided to try them out and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks i always had issues holding picks and keeping them put while i played and the jazz iii was no exception so it didn t bother me meaning i didn t really feel like there was a problem other than me being that problem then i read about this new ultex thingyit looked like a jazz iii and every one seemed to like it sooo i figured why not have a go at it i was skeptical about this impossible to drop thing which i read so i was dieing to feel them well they came i tried them and after playing for a while i didn t even notice that i hadn t once readjusted my pick not once it was like there was no pick i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be it stays there to me that s just freaking incredible holy wow i love this thing love it love it i have just receive mine just now it was awesome i never thought that it would be so solid it is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge can t beat the price i would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand a
259	i am extremely pleased with this amp i purchased it because i was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill the numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud the other reviews detail the exact specs much better than i could so i will defer to them for that however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone i highly recommend it i bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since awesome feel sound and price just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that i do i know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my strat one thing i notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others i have tried thats nice these strings have a tonal quality that will change your life if you eve ever wondered how the greats such as wes montgomery george benson and larry coryell have been able to get their awesome mellow tones i d recommend this even to metal players as a change of pace as they may get something out of it that they ve never considered before obviously this takes someone who is willing to give a change to their accustomed style of playing a try trust me i ve been playing professionally for decades and i can say that there s no way i d turn my back on these as a jazz enthusiast also if you re interested in saving the skin on your fingers this product will help as i haven t even come close to the normal amount of skin shedding experienced previously on roundwounds i m not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder maybe if you change strings a lot then this could be a key part of you equipment bag the cutter part is nice it is solid and effective without being too heavy yet it does feel well made for the price keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings i m just getting into miking and recording music mainly to get my son off to a good start i m kind of feeling my way when i wasn t getting a good result from a dynamic mic a friend suggested a pre amp and or a condenser mike i ended up getting both the amp tube pre amp and running this through the amp into my tascam dp wow i have to work on getting the levels matched properly but this thing is just so much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar our music sessions have slowed down a bit he just turned so hanging with the old man is the last thing on his mind lol but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable includes a nice hard plastic carry case too for this kind of money you can t really go wrong i ve been recording on my imac ipod touch ipad and iphone for some time using garage band interfacing with the imac is easy using various usb devices i m currently using a usb equipped alesis preamp ios device interface is a bit more difficult it is possible to use usb preamps with an externally powered usb hub but that starts getting very complicated and messy i ve been using simple devices like the k that split the headphone microphone jack into two separate cords one for headphone and one for guitar the problem with this sort of configuration is that it s very easy to overload the microphone input and the recording quality done this way is not very good the apogee jam is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons first it contains its own dedicated preamp and a d and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity interface issues are non existent plugged into both the ipad and iphone it was immediately recognized i didn t have any problems with either of the three supplied cables the jam is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces but on the whole i think it s worth it it s simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality it does seem to draw a fair amount of current and battery life is shortened significantly when using this with an iphone you ll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions with the ipad this isn t as noticeable even with that issue i think the jam is a good value the various ios devices are capable of making very high quality recordings but only with quality input given the cost of an new iphone or ipad the cost of the jam is rather trivial in comparison i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel these strings are what i needed and they perform d addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric arch top smooth but not dull sounding will defiantly be buying more i ve been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy this was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine no regrets on the buy at all
260	i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it what i like about this one is how the release lever works on the cannon the lever was vertical this made actuating it a less natural motion with this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use an argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but i have had no issue with it aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well color and appearance is a personal thing i think these abalone picks just look cool the color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone fender makes a nice standard pick the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy these mediums work well for playing electric guitar i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex those work well for acoustic i ve used dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the dava rubber coated picks they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick the gray dunlop s don t look anywhere near as cool as these at for a dozen they re worth a try it they don t work out for playing they sure look darn nice the fender logo is in gold dava grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey mm this is a great addition to any stereo system today assuming you still use your turntable two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play free of any annoying pops or clicks it won t save a dirty record you ll have to buy a cleaning solution for that but this brush will easily take care of dust hair and other particles that get attracted to your lps during regular use as another reviewer suggested i do the first pass with the brush going with the record as if i was spreading out paint or something like that and that gets most of the surface particulate free the second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record after that your record will sound brand new again there are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options but none that are this easy and this cheap the version i picked came with a grounding wire claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic producing snap crackles and pops if you believe that continue to do so and maybe you ll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device speaking more pragmatically i ve found some use for the item only when loose conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record but frankly the old discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap and a new paint brush then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth just try not to get the labels wet
261	i started experimenting on strings i ll try using bronze strings i noticed when i was using the phosphor bronze after a while it started to sound dull when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer i decided i would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time i would recommend others to try it this strap replaces another one just like it which i use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons for stage i like something heavier good quality the holes work with my strap buttons okay my lower button is an output jack for an after market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button but this strap works okay with it it just takes a little more force to get it on which i m sure will go away over time with use great price for a simple strap at around i recently changed them out for a different type of eb s while they were good the were not exactly what i was looking for not sure the new set is either but time will tell it s an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off i ve read where people are using bottle caps instead of these my guitar is more valuable to me than that i suppose because i m not trusting that my expensive gitty won t hit the floor i mean you pay for a quality instrument right why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe i m sorry but that s just idiocy in action this isn t get an upgrade already i play standing up of the time so these are a necessity i have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily but all except one snapped right back together when i first started playing i had a brand new to me guitar hit the floor and the neck break because i didn t use them that s something that should only happen once in your life if at all the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones they were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well gls audio ft mic cable is very high quality you will not be disappointed low cost long lasting i m very satisfied i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop locks i recommend the model they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way but these are just to big and clumsy the model does the same and doesn t take as much space you will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units this is true for either one of the models i have a regular nylon levy strap and these two models and si work well but i prefer the smaller rounder model they only fit if you have enough room in your strap button if not they will just pop right out i threw mine away my rhythm guitar player recently dropped and broke his sg because of no strap locks i bought him a set of these i use them because unless you standardize you need a separate strap for every set of locks this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair i bought two sets this is a great why if to keep your strap on your guitar if you still what to keep everything stock i even called dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic the guy at dunlop told me oh yes they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic that is not the case i purchased multiple units and it will cost me more to return to amazon than it s worth but basically i know have hunks of plastic that i could use to make a sculpture because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit if anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap please reply to this feedback what really frosts me is that i called dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don t know their products well enough to be recommending product it s called train your people i ve had the amp for months or so now and love it it s choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me i don t have the greatest guitar ever but the sounds from the amp are clean and crisp the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other less useful effects the auxillary jack is also a great addition the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use hard to believe this was so bad i have a planet waves locking guitar strap which is a dream and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap however it is so thick that it can t really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap and when i tried to lock it the two pieces came apart go with the planet waves lock straps
262	this is an amazing amp it works great a lot of power a little bit heavy for it s size but it is simply a beauty i play a godin a ultra and the the sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect even the acoustic sound is majestic this amp adapts to any need you have from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound i have to say i was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but i was shocked at the sounds i could get it took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone i wanted and off we went for the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone is worth twice as much as far as durability i have had in a month used it times so far so good i did purchase the protection plan for so i m covered for years
263	i bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my fender acoustic these are easy to install using the instructions or without these are also sturdy and look very good i installed these on a silvertone sd which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar they are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory if you are looking for a regular medium string these are real nice great product nice bright light i have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about years as with many things i m a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music this light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything the switch is conveniently located on top of the light the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move unlike my twin lights i ordered these for a gibson songwriter deluxe ec custom vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro touch longer than the stock pins from gibson the pins measure mm or inches in length i was going to return them but figured i would try them out in my gibson blues king l parlor sized guitar it was about the same result a little too thin smaller heads and slightly longer but i went ahead and tried them glad i did i didn t think that after using the tusq bridge that came stock from gibson it would make any detectable difference but i was wrong i can tell a slight difference i did not remove the strings just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it which were fresh from yesterday a small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable they also provide a graph in the packaging info but i think that it was a test using both the tusq pins and replacement saddle if you haven t changed your saddle do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one i must admit i did order these with about of dressing up the guitar in mind and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected i got both white with paua dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy i was seeking although there is no care taken as to match the dots for consistency they will vary in appearance the tusq pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar the heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher and i do wish that the tusq pins were the same size i will see how well they do on the blues king and most likely will order new pins for the songwriter deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two i don t expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion if in doubt consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the tone you have in mind be it darker brighter softer louder etc strings make a big difference and i find using d addario phosphor bronze strings very bright ringy last long are affordable and seem noticeably louder than ghs or ernie ball steel strings only does not apply to nylon or gut strings once again if you have a plastic saddle and or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference then again they might make all the difference in the world you just have to try them and see they are inexpensive and pretty well worth the risk brilliant solution to the strap button problem the pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won t slip off works as well as locking strap buttons did for me
264	i purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap way too small maybe like a third of the width i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something update when attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap it stays on pretty snugly but you need to attach it with something straps don t get any better than this super leather very well put together perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets for the gigging pro i think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight excellent just excellent
265	this came in the mail today in a rather large box the blue led light is fine you can put about medium picks in the pick holder more than enough to keep me and a friend in picks for a few songs it is not bad but i don t think i would purchase another one i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet but the wallet hasn t arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater but i suspected it would be before i ordered it so i don t count that against it holds medium picks with grip exceptionally tight almost annoyingly hard to get one out will be sure to update if wear tear has any effect on the grip on the picks but so far so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends i clip this pick holder to my music stand and it s always handy and very easy to use i use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder
266	most of the time i am able to use the g capo with one hand when moving it adjusting it and clamping it in place however sometimes i have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don t buzz that may seem like not such a big deal but i prefer to have an easier one to work with i have small hands and an old carpal injury so i prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo this one is better than the any of the clasping kinds keysers etc in that respect after a couple of playing sessions i figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time now that i ve learned how best to use it i ll keep it when i first got it i was upset that i had to use hands and forcible squeezing to put in place but now i ve learned how to work it better so that i can do most of it with one hand without too much strain a capo should be easy to remove and put on stay in tune not hurt the hands no handed squeezing not interfere with playing when inserted and it shouldn t break too soon have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all on the plus side this unit seems pretty well made so it should last a long time i think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically i ve tried so many capos now and the only ones i liked were the planet waves screw tops they are easy to use easy to move from fret to fret light on the hands stay in tune and out of the way but they break in damp california weather i ve had of them break on me within a couple months they snap and go airborn which is dangerous next i ll try the dunlop victor capos they are screw tops similar in style to the planet waves dunlop also makes the planet waves capos but they are made with more durable bronze so they should last longer and i hope those will be the best for me i also ordered an aluminum version of the planet waves in hopes it won t break like their thermoplastic ones do if you have small hands like me and don t want to strain the hands while playing like me then that rules out the kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos the shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust and the springtop ones are suspect as well that s why i like the screwtops that don t get in the way and are easy to adjust ok i hope the dunlop victor will do the job for me now i ll try it next although this light is a little pricey in my opinion it really gets the job done i do like the fact that you can use batteries or a cadapter to power the light the nine led s really light up my music stand the carrying case that comes with it is well made makestransportation keeping it stored easy r joyner this is the godzilla of volume pedals it is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it it appears to be indestructible i like that it has a tuner output and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver when a friend offered to sell his for bucks i bought it without hesitation i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results if you need light maybe keep looking if you don t mind the heft you will be pleased i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool it s complicated which for a capo is saying something the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use bottom line if you don t mind the extra effort and don t plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using then maybe you will enjoy it for everyone else look elsewhere taylor ships this guitar with these strings and for a good reason they sound wonderful right out of the box like with most all string guitars lights or extra lights are most often appropriate the feel of these nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate in tandum with the instrument bring out it s best resonance and sustainability give em a try this is a nice addition to a guitar that you don t want to drill a hole into for a strap button it s a quick release with the buckle one end stays on the strap the other around the head stock of the guitar makes it nice if you have more than one guitar without a strap button buy the cloth that comes with the product is a high quality polishing cloth but some idiot thought it was best to package it stuck to the bottle with a glue button that leaves glue stuck to the cloth this glue is only removable after a expensive bath using goo gone or similar glue dissolving solution then washing with warm soapy water by hand and rinsing thoroughly in clear clean running water until all soap is removed then hanging the cloth up to air dry preferably outdoors in the sunshine if you have that available the cloth is so nice it is worth the time consuming and correct method of cleaning but is not why you buy a product that is supposed to clean and polish in the first place somebody better redesign the packaging for this product as the gibson cleaner polish is first rate and puts a high lustrous shine on the guitar surface which comes out bright dry and hard almost like having used a high quality paste wax but without residue very good stuff very irresponsible packaging for the convenience of the factory i assume but without forethought to the customer s needs works great keeps all my fretboards looking great even though i change strings frequently on my twelve acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever i play hard for several hours almost every day and i m always amazed at the crud that accumulates on the fretboards guess i ll have to stop eating cheetos while i m playing just kidding this oil breaks down the crud and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition no issues no problems only positive things to say about the oil this shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand it just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils pens clip on tuners capos etc it pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page i love how a pen capo or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is trained to stay in place a must have five star item probably the best capo i have ever had it s easy to put on and holds the strings well although you always need to check the tuning after putting any capo on a guitar this one seems not to upset the tuning too much i m impressed the g th performance capo is by far the nicest capo i have had in years of playing the main obstacle in using in using a capo is it throwing your guitar all out of tune every single time well the g th performance capo is definitely the worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune it is easy to use and holds all strings down completely and easily the g th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose i never use slide to play my guitar this is the first i ever have look like good quality i just have to learn how to play
267	this mxl studio usb microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone we professionally produce instructional videos both at our shop and at customer locations and often need to voice over footage this mic will replace theblue microphones snowball usb microphone textured white we use in studio and also themxl mics mxl studio usb condenser microphone cardioidwe had previously used for off site recording pros good voice quality cleanly captures spoken voices good physical quality this is beefy mic that feels very well made looks professional while not important to the functionality it makes a good impression on our customers long usb cord allows for placement away from pc headphone jack real time monitor handy to listen to live recording and playback travels well includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentscons no pop filter included normally i wouldn t mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage like from breath moisture and a pop filter is essential we boughtnady mpf inch clamp on microphone pop filter left channel only brings in audio on the left channel had to compensate in my editing softwaremisc since we do not do music recording of any type i can t comment on the mic s performance in that area software studio control gui downloadable can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software sony vegas pro gives me better control for what we dothe mxl studio mic more than meets our needs which may be different from yours recommended cfh barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer s defects the unit does what it was meant to do i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system although the inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about to its defense it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than feet away after playing with the device for a couple more minutes i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception even the length of the mic cord whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality yikes perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above i m afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes i ll probably be returning this unit asap if you have a better mic you can plug that into the transmitter as it s a simple mini jack and that helps this sound wise quite a bit i will say range is not great it won t go feet like my expensive sennheiser kit but this will go about feet line of sight before cutting out note it s vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference i find the transmitters to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well i also wish it was an xlr connection a lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so don t toss this around or it will break for general use in doors it s decent and for sure worth the price but if you re looking for something clear you should look to spend at least on a wireless lapel or handheld system bought this as a back up to my at system and have only tried it in my living room home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although i think i hear a little distortion if i turn the gain up too much i don t think you can change the gain on the at system my only nitpick is that i ll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a for the price it s amazing i just hope it works in the field as well arrive in trashed packing but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics after stringing them up tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded i play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played they sounded great all up down the fret board where i really noticed the difference was in recording been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before except for the songs with acoustic bass i will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before i installed these strings i don t play slap or pick bass so i can t say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended
268	pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this good quality xlr cable that works fine i m happy with this purchase as another guy said not better not bad simply different it s true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not like dunlop has a little bit of more wah range than behringer i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it more expensive than the behringer to my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer cheaper does not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparent more features than dunlop wha sound is not like the dunlop s it is different but nice i personally like so bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic good deal just get it i highly recommend it thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt i was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasn t recognized and i sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel now it s working xlr cables are hard to mess up these are great they do the trick why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap again these microphones are made for studio i use it live again you have to have a good pa system for these to work great great microphone if you want to really sound like a real singer this is the top of the top thank you amazon for years i ve owned a nice at recently i ve wanted to be able to double mic vocals for vocal doubling ambiance chorus effect etc but didn t have the cash for another at or similar after searching the net extensively i kept seeing the mxl rated very highly and decided to take the plunge and figured i ll just return it if it s not any good wow i can t hear any discernible difference when simultaneously recording the at on the left channel and the mxl on the right channel they both sound great and i think the mxl even looks better and feels just as solid as the at a definite keeper it s great that advancements in design and engineering are producing high quality products for the masses at rock bottom prices who says you can t afford the good stuff these days keep it up technology gurus i got this mic to record a vocal podcast and so far i m very happy with the results the sound quality is wonderful the sensitivity is amazing clarity is great packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer i m not an audio expert but so far the sound quality out of this mic sounds very excellent to me this mic has amazing quality i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about years feels great to finally have professional sounding music check out my soundcloud soundcloud com ljaymusic really dope mic
269	this is a really solid table mic stand and you re not going to find a better price i looked the base is solid and heavy and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second i should note though that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips which i can imagine being disappointing even though it didn t affect me we bought this rack tray for our son s new sound rack it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet it is a short shelf so it only goes about half way to the back of the rack cabinet he uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet love the security of having my picks within grasp great product and great value i would highly recommend this to others did a ton of research out there b i bought this i can t believe that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal what a racket it is if i could make one i would this one was cheap and does the job dunzos i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures the day they arrived i happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so i tried one of these the cable is soft and flexible and i could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable i had been using that s a good thing my other cable was very expensive the connectors are not gold plated but it s an inexpensive cable it s not pretending to be anything other than a decent low cost xlr two conductor shielded cable it s working for me i ll be buying more for our studio i have been using these for months now with string bass i think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar as i often find myself playing with fingers then suddenly a pick song starts and where s a pick i usually have to offset it and with the tuner placement i can only fit one pick but i still find them indispensable and no tape or other sticky stuff there is also a model made specially for bass updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses it is definitely better for thicker strings the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer i do love it but the spreading strings on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect so still highly recommended if your headstock has a straight through design not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock they should make a metal edition for that good quality cable and sounds very good
270	the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow this thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately exact easy to use fun to look at there is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better ordered a set of these to put on my ibanez and on my squier they fit perfectly highly recommended i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa i don t think that many people would do this the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box it works for me i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas i had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger i took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards not forwards by hand slowly until it was perfect i also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case i slipped took me about hours the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance really close but they were terrible in operation i have no problems spending the on these to improve the guitar haven t played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes update played for a couple hours first thing i notice is that they are geared lower than the old chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment this fixed the chibson tuning issue i ll order another set for my other chibson also i have two epiphones i believe these are nicer than the epi s so i bought based solely on the reviews here i wasn t disappointed in fact i am pretty impressed good replacement for iffy tuners they worked for me
271	not too much to say about a cable it worked out of the box no shorts or noises the jacket on the straight plug was partly unscrewed and that s a continuing problem with these cords i use some thread lock on them i find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things first of all let me say from some of the pictures i have seen posted of this pop filter when put on a yeti mic stand the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured this is a design flaw not with the pop filter but with the yeti stand as this filter has been around long before the yeti came out blue or a clever do it yourself person could easily fix it by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well since i have mine hanging upside down on a boom stand attached to a blue radius shock mount this is not an issue for me but i will say it is a problem blue should fix i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems i am not going to knock any stars off because i m reviewing the filter itself which is superb and how it works for me now for the meat this is a studio grade high quality product all metal except for the two tightening knobs the dual screen design eliminates any plosives p s and b s for example better than any screen i have used so far this is especially true when the screen distance is about an inch from the yeti capsule screen and you are to inches away from the unit itself which i have found to be the yeti s sweet spot in the cardioid pattern next the silk screened blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot if you place it in front of the capsule area i like the idea of a metal screen especially if you are transporting it you won t have to worry about snagging or runs as you do with the cloth filters speaking of old cloth filters i have a neumann which is about years old a very nice screen as well but it does not cut the pops as well as the blue especially if you get closer to the mic and screen also when reading copy or maybe music i can see over and through the blue filter much better than the round inch jobs like the neumann you can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily cheaper filters i have used in the past will creep back into unwanted positions the blue behaves the blue pop is absolutely transparent no muffling as with foam filters the curved design of the blue filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all the screen is a solid build as are all of the blue products i have used so far it also fits the look of the yeti and radius shock mount like a glove surprisingly i paid a little over on amazon a real bargain in my mind for such high quality this filter is for all the blue microphones by the way and i am going to use it on my entire collection of mics addendumif you need to use the yeti as a table top mic especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter any brand i would suggest buying asamson samd md desktop mic stand which works great for this set up if you like thick heavy gauge picks but find they wear too fast for you this is the pick for you they have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff but also wear as in don t wear down like nothing else these were a very nice find i bought this because it was cheap and figured it can t be that bad i was surprised that it was good i had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldn t tell the difference i purchased three of these three different colors to make a mini snake for my keyboard to their di s i typically used mogami neutrik but need cakes while in the road i usually roll my own to exact length these have worked well quiet no handling noise seem well built i treat cables well so i don t really test them with under tough circumstances and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future they are used nights a week and after uses no problems i recommend them plus for live the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well nice pieces
272	it s a very solidly made stand simple to assemble perfect for my home studio holding my key midi controller keyboard i m very happy with the purchase and the price was right works great i didn t use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws next time i m buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so i don t have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars for now i m hanging one on the wall with this and it s fine wood is nice quality i notice the price is almost x as much if you walk in the guitar center i really like this one as a pre to my fender superchamp x head especially on the distortion channel it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a huge sweeping circuit i was not able to get it even close to way without it being just ugly but that might be preference also of note is that i ran my fender mustang bass guitar through this active pickups and i loved the grit that it gave the sound this is a great pedal for the and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure this mixer is just what i ve been looking for the inputs makes it very versatile for different projects this mixer is a little too much for me considering that i only record with one xlr track use the outputs for my uca interface but it s good to have these extra inputs just in case i want to stretch my creativity anyways this is an amazing mixer for the price anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one guaranteed amazing ness
273	great tuner for the price makes tunning easy and fast the grips come off the neck on my acoustic but works better on my electric the jim dunlop cb capo has a powerful spring and works on both and string guitars just squeeze and slide it where you need it available in several finishes to match your taste i had intended to carry this with my keys attached to my chain wallet but the wallet hasn t arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater but i suspected it would be before i ordered it so i don t count that against it holds medium picks with grip exceptionally tight almost annoyingly hard to get one out will be sure to update if wear tear has any effect on the grip on the picks but so far so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends
274	purchased the string kyser capo when i meant to get the string version slightly longer stronger spring but find that this string capo not only works great on my string acoustics but also works on my string acoustic with a little adjusting quality seems top notch design is simple and effective i am proud to have this product fits my fender well looks amazing great quality in it also i am pleased simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings i have used on all my guitars it even fits my acoustic string update year later and the string cleaner is going strong wash up in soap and water and let dry i bought a nd one great tool i used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys but this trims steel and nylon with ease the quick slack take up winder is nice also but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars this is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music speeches it is easily mounted on the mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs i would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand i am using it with my samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife s toshiba tablet highly recommended great pickup combined with the fishman aura spectrum d i you will have an excellent experience even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy these strings sound great and so far have held tune well after a couple of days of stretching i have them on my luna string and the sound is rich i would purchase them again
275	put these on my prs se and i love em i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe they were a perfect fit no problems whatsoever this is good cable excellent plugs the lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material which will hold everything in place for years grade a cable at a very affordable price definitely going back for more the ft cable was only a couple dollars more than ft use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my older model gold tone banjo ukulele smooth as silk work great as all grovers do awesome little untreated polishing cloth i have purchased these for all of my guitars more than i care to admit and they are fantastic they clean great removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced awesome product to keep your axe looking great this is a great pedal very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board i also like the tone a lot bear in mind i like the more vintage tones it s not a crisp crystal clear tone like you d get with a digital delay it s got more warmth there s a great video on yt from proguitarshop com that demos it very well it s got great short and long delay very smooth feel and the mod switch adds just the right amount of modulation to your tone to make it a tad fuller this is not a bright sounding delay it can be a tad dark at times if you re not careful i use this for my long delay sounds and use another delay for short slap back and echo sounds it s a mooer micropedal they work well together too to get a huge fuller ambient type of sound going i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain i use all my pedals right into the front of my amp as there s no effects loop i hope this helps your decision if you like warm old school tones you ll dig this pedal
276	i always find it interesting the different opinions about products some don t like the sound others say these wear out in a day really do you play for hours some say that the grip is good here s my take for what it s worth i ve listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars round and flat wound strings my general take is that these picks give a better fuller rounder bigger tone overall compared to the tortex style pick material mm for the tortex it s a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material thickness or a combination of both also note i play with the rounded edge not the tip so the grip in the center of these doesn t quite fit my grip style but it s still ok i do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all i ve been subjective in my comparisons but this is what i ve found so far i find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars i m currently playing the process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time give these a try and let me know what you think this speaker has a very clear full range sound i have it in a brown deluxe and am very good with it in a way it reminds me a bit of a jbl with the smooth depth and clarity if i want a little ray charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack cool speaker and nice addition im not loyal to brands on the whole but when i reach for a pick i hope this is the one i get they wear out and get nicks so i have to remember to keep ordering them edit watch the steve vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn nicked picks rapidly firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet the motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick repeat or times and whadda u know the edge is now smooth and nice well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions pretty much what i expected much more relaxed at higher volumes than the m definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the m will have to reduce the mids a bit via the fuse editor although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy this is of course via the front panel only i m sure it can be done using the fuse editor it s supposed to be lbs heavier than the m but it sure doesn t feel like it i keep looking at the m fiendishly wondering if there s a way to shoehorn a speaker in there for the most part the patches created in the m translated pretty well after the required firmware update needing just a few adjustments here and there i m appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as i won t have to crank the bass control as much as i have to on the m that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp more from editing via fuse here are a few of the things that i found and liked the deluxe model sounds better with the deluxe s cab and vice versa the has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the s cab while the model s propensity to break up sooner works better with the s less sparkly cab the also seems to have more low end girth the twin is a bit too icepick y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the bassman s cab the supersonic s cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds i use that have a bit more gain it s good for keeping things from getting too buzzy it s a very fat sounding cab sim both the m and seem to respond really well with my tex mex pickups i have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet my other guitar has mini humbuckers but somehow i get the feeling that i won t like it as much as i do with the strat i think this is understandable though since fender has always been all about the single coils i m not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on so far for bucks i couldn t ask for more the low e tuner on my lp standard broke about a week ago the back came off and the tuning handle popped out i never liked the ones that were on it but i didn t want to drop the unless i needed to i came across these grovers they had good reviews and the price was right took me about minutes to replace all the tuners and re string the guitar the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced it s hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as i haven t had them on for long enough they seem better though as the b string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly i decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these grovers they fit better i e tighter nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug i like them and glad i purchased them so far
277	this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable great device and good price my wife made me try this for a gig we had it worked great i love the foggy effect on stage with a touch of lighting it really comes to life the fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice i don t know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but i have another can of juice i bought to use later i will report on that i gave it stars although the fog juice is funky because it s not the fog juice that matters it s how the machine works it does what it should do these are a must have item heretofore i ve been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism while it s an innovative system that doesn t require any installation the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things i installed the schallers on my warmoth strat body i found that i needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit not a big deal at all these schallers are exactly what i wanted stars and a no brainer the only reason i m not giving this one star is that i didn t expect much for such a low cost pedal i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals we have a punk ska band think suicide machines sublime and need to switch a lot in all our songs i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile nope this pedal sucks your guitar s tone and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going and its not a pleasant sound either way avoid these are excellent guitar picks they don t slip in my fingers like the eddie van halen guitar picks i purchased a while back these locks are the only ones i use now they are on all of my guitars and i put them on all i build i have not had a guitar drop since i started using them and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached i have tried the fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my schaller equipped straps will not fit them i will stick with the schaller in all colors
278	they work as well as any dunlop pick they don t crack which is a big plus if you use the general fender variety i go a little thicker than i would for regular plastic picks because they get flimsy after a while take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store i have schaller security strap locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase schallers for that one soon these give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place my larrivee rs came with these and converted me to schaller this is one of the best mics in this price range it sounds incredible and at this price it s unbeatable i only use three mics and this is my main vocal drum overhead and acoustic guitar mic although i use two mics on the guitar my other mic s are a sm which is incredible and not crazy expensive and an audio technica instrument vocal mic i love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks schaller guitar strap locks work really really well however i had problems at first until i made some changes first off you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen the blue stuff will be more than enough second the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn loosen the screw over time kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar so when i install the new button i put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first never had one unscrew again if you do those things first you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident ever but you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock i usually stickup to the overdrive pedals asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives still i needed a distortion that could cover of the marshall sound like roar jcm and this guy did the job it s not a riot but pretty much defends its self from the old s songs love it i put these strings on every acoustic i own they sound great and are priced right you can t go wrong with d addario strings as a professional guitar player i am always nervous playing a show with old strings however i ve been using elixir for over years now and the strings really do last a long time i would usually replace my strings every month but i ve started leaving them on for up to months i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul i have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the hercules the stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs there is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands i can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place i strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there the extra cost is well worth the investment i bought this at my local guitar shop for after looking into it the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while i was there update a few weeks ago i bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers i usually buy locally but the deal here was great the stand is worth the price and more works very smoothly and doesn t eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners we have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a pack for yep a buck i m sold on these and will be getting another as soon as i need one these trees came in fender packaging and fit just as the old ones did and look the same they have the same locating pin in front of the screw and are the finishing touch in refurbishing my guitar
279	i will let you know that i ve been using boom stands for years and that i write this so you can make an informed decision i m loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college i see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good i particularly don t think the horizontal axis point is very good i mean where you adjust the angle of the boom it s a cheap version of a simple design and i suspect the day will come that you re trying to figure how to keep it from drooping the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something s got to give the tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and i d predict someday you ll be going from duct tape to replacing it i base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement which is harder on equipment than recording and because i own both types of businesses the boom in general isn t a nice one and will always be inches because it isn t telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight so you re mainly purchasing the stand on stage has a better line they call the vs this series b pro tripod microphone boom standjust like you can t compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup this one is so inexpensive too inexpensive that price comparisons aren t what s important so looking at amazon today i d probably buy the ms tb teleboom microphone standor this one dr pro mic stand telescoping boomor maybe try this onehosa msb bk mic stand with boomi haven t tried that stand but since hosa generally sells good inexpensive products i d be inclined to give it a try i think you ll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice i d pay attention to the and star reviews because you ll find more from experienced users and the most helpful star do not say how long they ve been using it but love how inexpensive it is ignore that it doesn t come with a mic clip because usually they don t clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately all but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced so plan on putting weight on a leg if you re using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight like what s used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination as for the cheap cord clips just forget them and buy these they ll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent no leftover duct tape glue velcro reusable self gripping tiesbut understand my position i ve got stands purchased years ago that i can still use and don t feel the lowest price is always the best value but you re intelligent so you know an stand used for years is year i use stands almost everyday and i don t think this would last me a year and maybe only months but if you don t care about a telescoping boom and you don t plan to adjust it much and you use a average weight mic or you re alright with replacing the boom when neededthis stand could be fine for you now if you can t budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some i did give it stars but are for the product and is for the price so i hope all of this helps you with your decision i ve now purchased and reviewed theon stage band recommend checking it out this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together using just one wall wart you can power all of them at least those that receive this kind of power v where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l converter cl for line products i have an m audio black box which had a peculiar size plug it was v ma but nothing would fit then i tried the l converter and bingo i m in business and black box bliss i would recommend having it around just for that it costs about the same as odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can t find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters a pedal junkies salvation when i found that my usb microphone cannot stand on the tripod that came with it i was so glad that i bought this stand along with the mic based on all the positive reviews this stand is basically dead weight that s exactly what i wanted from a desk stand this is an inexpensive sturdy sustain pedal that i immediately buy every time i get a new yamaha keyboard this pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano much better than any footswitch only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity it may or may not work properly with non yamaha keyboards strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job the price was right may buy another for a spare be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy other than that an excellent value these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough mic great for all your needs i highly recommend them i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence this has the largest top of any of my stands and it is the one i use when traveling gigs the top doesn t fold like some of the more expensive stagg hercules stands so if you re using it for gigging that may be something to consider i have to lug an key weighted piano around so don t mind lugging this leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it previously i used to use a shoe lace and i would be thinking about it falling while playing now i have more confidence with this strap it s not gucci but doesn t feel like plastic either it s perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use we use these at my church and they get moved around a little bit but not much for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine of stands in this price range this is at the top of what i ve experienced it s easily adjustable the screws stay tight once adjustments are made it s light but not so light that it tips or blows over the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling seriously for those who don t need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around this is the one to go with if you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and or going on tour shipping around in airplanes or vans etc you will need to go up a notch or two in quality and sadly price good quality for my casual use i wouldn t use it on stage because of stability or weight related issues it s too light i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic granted they are not the hercules stands that i use but they work for my two other singers great quality and i would definitely buy them again i ve been buying cheap stands and i m never really getting what i want i finally bought this nice and solid i just did a quick mic test with this cable and everything sounded good it coils nicely and has good connectors i really like this stand i even bought a second one after giving it a try is solid you maybe need to tight too strong to avoind the weight of the mic to bring the arm down buy i can do that recommended quality is really outstanding for the price sound is clear and crisp i get a lot of feedback but i guess that it is not because of the microphone this product has a simple function but if you need a v adapter this is the one to get i trust the planet waves brand this is a great stand the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand it s okay i ve bought stands for less that were more balanced and sturdy and the little safety strap is a nuisance more than a help i love this product it came fast included extra shockmount line shockmount an adapter the mic instructions and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting the sound quality is great with the art tube preamp use mic cables not cables for phantom power and i couldn t be happier with it it even looks impressive although i do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny when in reality it is this off silver color almost a gold but not quite it s not bad or anything just different and frankly the thing could be purple for all i care as long as it produces great sound that s all that matters great product and extremely affordable no complaints use to record my music works great on vocals and instrument together or separate i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up it grabs everything so you need to be careful of background get it if you are even thinking dont forget phantom power is needed no problem at all great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thak you very much this seems like a good deal for the price i have concerns about durability for anyone who has to frequently adjust the boom or takes it on the road because that boom adjustment joint is a bit flimsy i bought it for home studio use by just me so i am totally satisfied this is a fine stand for the price but i was honestly surprised at how light it is i honestly think on stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price i do use this stand but i wish i would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future it works fine just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past i sit i drum it works there s not much to say except that it get the job done very well no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included the only place is on the box after you have received the item there s no instruction which is fine but in the product description it doesn t say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can t use it i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can t because it doesn t come with a mic clip which i have to spend another to get it plus shipping the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip but without it i felt cheated solid stays where i put it and does a great job holding a heavy mic mount and pop filter can t really beat it for the price since i bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them i use to misplace my picks all the time when playing and now i do not have to look around for them any longer as i know where to find them i like to use different gage picks therefore i have ordered more for christmas stocking stuffers whicdh will be enjoyed by my friends i needed a cheap mic stand that didn t break the bank this little guy fit the bill i don t know if it could stand up next to the hercules stands that i have used for years in terms of long term durability but for a simple home use stand it is perfect it is sturdy the knobs feel tight and is balanced great entry level stand i got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail saves some money on replacements i found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so i like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings i use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand it is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing only thing make sure you read the description well it is a euro stand so it has threads it does not come with a mic clip when i ordered my mic from behringer their clip had standard threads which obviously would not attach i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going overall i would buy again this could be used for lightweight microphones but don t bother wasting your money if you re using a studio microphone the base has a small circumference so you can t stick the boom out very far at all almost useless there are better deals for just slightly more money or if you really want near studio quality try the samson studio boom mic stands i like the stand it makes my recording convenient it is well built the adjustable parts are easy to use this stand i very good just wish it was a bit heavier for helping it be more stable when using a heavy mic these are my favorite strings to use on my american strat they feel great sound great and are extremely cheap i would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user buy a pack and try them out for less than you can see if they work well for you i had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy so i wanted something that would grip the ipad this stand does the trick i don t have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand some people have said that it s not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position i have not found that to be true since i ve had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic because of the way that i stand with my guitar it s hard for me to see the thing when i use the clamp kind this one uses the mic clip treads and because it s on it s own stand i can put it anywhere at any height and see the ipad the only drawback is you can t have your ipad in a case or you have to find a case that s ultra thin otherwise it s great currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount when fully extended the arm can t hold the entire weight of the shockmount yeti microphone i rigged it behind my monitor wall mount frame didn t want to mount the montiors to the walls and it works just fine not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine i always seem to have to re tune with the spring loaded capo s rarely have to re tune with this one highly recommend when you extend it out all the way it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom but other than that this stand is perfect good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length i gave it too our drummer and he uses regularly without complaint i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic i use it for video and photo purposes holding light reflectors flagging speedlights etc it s heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo does what it says with no whining whatsoever really quiet producing absolutely no audible hum very small footprint too would i recommend it yes i would i bought this stand to mic a kick drum it s too tall for lining the mic up with my port even at it s shortest setting still it s well constructed and would make a good desk top mic mount i like on stage stuff good value and good function ay yo homie this interface be off the hook you know i be all interfacin and stuff you feel thx behringer not the best quality in the world but for the price tag is wasn t half bad if you re doing something more professional it may wear out overtime but if it s just for personal use you should be fine with this product i cant play real guitars but i did buy this for rock band this is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way this has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it i even use it when im drumming i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried
280	it s hard to really describe what this pedal does it doesn t distort flange echo or produce a chorus i d heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it and because words don t do an accurate job in describing it i would have probably never pulled the trigger on one even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go as luck would have it i acquired one on trade and i have to admit that i agree with the whole blanket euphemism this stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my blues jr when placed at the end of my pedaltrain right before i run into the amp i don t feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp s tone though i do believe it works even better in a loop i placed it in the effects loop of both a palomino v usa ampeg made and a crate vc a watt usa made el tube amp with celestian speaker and it was transformative to both amps tone in a great way it does very well with single coils it s a pedal that i would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in i don t think it works as well when i run my lp into a jet city combo particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures harmonics that amp also lacks an effects loop and i imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase i guess it s rig dependent but it s a keeper for what it does to the sound of my fender believe this feet cable is no small thing the jacks are high quality construction very very durable the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years i m glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available this pedal works great and doesn t slide at all the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need not the best pedal out there by far but great for a beginner with a limited budget the only reason i m not giving this one star is that i didn t expect much for such a low cost pedal i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals we have a punk ska band think suicide machines sublime and need to switch a lot in all our songs i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile nope this pedal sucks your guitar s tone and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going and its not a pleasant sound either way avoid the regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end my fender excelsior with it s inch speaker rattled the walls of its sweep and can give a very cool effect i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed also the speed know has a great range with second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones the depth knob does it s job it doesn t have a manual knob to move the sweep but i leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it s no big deal for the price this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my vox modeling amp not much to say about a plain leather strap except that it s what i wanted and serves me well with the fender guitar it s strapped to the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues the only reason i didn t give it stars is it tends to be a little noisey if you turn the gain up too much you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great hello musicfriends this is built cheap but sounds great good controls too for me in the studio songwriting its perfect but i would not exactly go on tour with it there is something about the knobs i still love even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it may be the age thing been using this brand of strings since i ve always been pleased i like the super slinks as well love um these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable these are not x paper size they are about half sheet size
281	it s not bad it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger still i d rather stick with a copper slide a little small for my taste very thin but works well and dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician this is a great glass slide but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced my finger stays too tight not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out i ll start this by saying i prefer metal slides to glass tone snob that i am so i wasn t too excited about playing with this until i played with it the tone is amazing great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics i now only use metal slides and my dunlop bottleneck
282	i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options they sound just like i thought they would i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome i would buy these again these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice this was my first strap it looks good feels pretty strong and it is difficult to strap to the guitar by being difficult i mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons and it holds on tight this makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground you can t beat the price either
283	there good mics great cord for the money works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas will buy more in future this cable is perfect great sound quality and durability i will not buy any other cable except planet waves best bang for the buck for any working musician hands down yes there are cheaper cables but they don t sound as good or last as long planet waves is the way to go bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite i interface my cousin and i can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd so it was something that was necessary and not waste of money or an unwanted item also i don t really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends so now i can listen through my speakers love the security of having my picks within grasp great product and great value i would highly recommend this to others
284	purchased for hanging two rock band pseudo guitars works great for that and for uke would also be ok with guitars the nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar like instrument within reason the packaging is very basic you just get the product with no fasteners or instructions the hanger looks good is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments when solidly mounted the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments though i did not test that for the cost these are a smoking deal the alternatives i purchased for my music room heavy bass guitars cost about x more and are not necessarily any better functionally as mentioned there is no included hardware but that is a non issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall board fasteners depending on your situation and weight of your instrument so just plan on visiting the hardware store if you don t already have these in your shop i used wall board hangers for one direct screws into joist for the other as it happens works well easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers i ve had this is one great looking cable i purchased this cable december and it is still working well and stilllooks good and as fernando lamas says it is better to look good than to feel good well not when itcomes to cables this cable is awg with an ultra pure copper center conductor and copper and conductivepolymer shield you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud helps keep those ugly micro phonics away and you want that big time the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is pf ft this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style they look terrific but i find this fatso muchharder to coil than the thinner spectraflex vintage this company makes the bulkiness of this cabledoesn t seem to lend itself to easy coiling it also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage the easiest of my cables to coil by the way is the lava cable magma which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava pretty doesn t count for much with me i gave this cable stars because of its very good sound is well constructed has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs looks darn marvelous and has about average specs for the money yet difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis if you want a beautiful well made cable that you don t have to put away every day buy this one if you need a cord and don t want to pay a lot this is a good one i was surprised howsturdy it appears the only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine i ve tried to like this pedal i really have maybe it s my signal chain my experience with the digitech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar sure the od is there but it isn t worth losing your tone is it again i reiterate maybe it s just me i have been messing around with signal chains for almost decades now and the blue pedal isn t any different either imo grunge was ok but not my kind of style
285	works great haven t had a problem until now very durable and not uncomfortable either really awesome item for any type of electric guitar while ordering a guitar case the guitar strap popped up and i could not pass up the deal i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good good quality one i like the big size type would like to have a thinner one so far so good i bought another heavy lp guitar recently and thought i m going to use fender leather strap i bought in target a while ago not sure why i never buy guitar stuff there it looks good then well you get what you pay for leather looking paper wouldn t hold guitar so i gave it a chance and bough this on and it seems like this strap holding well ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly it still not too wide to play for few hours but for that you have to buy one so this one works well for the price this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag it arrived on time and was as described price was very reasonable it is easy to use with one hand and does the job not sure what else can be said about a capo they either work or do not the other aspect is longevity and only use and time will tell that i love these strings i m a novice and have been using the strings that came with base which were roundwound strings i don t like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes with these flats the sound is gone what more the sound of these strings is a lot more bold and has some awesome tone it s easy to tell what strings are for notes but just in case you have a hard time telling thickness for some reason they are color coded to help with that i can t speak out about other types of strings but i love these over roundwounds in both how they play and the sound i will experiment with other flats over time but i am very happy with these i m enjoying it i actually bought it keep my amp off the floor but i also like that it puts the amp at an angle pointing upwards it s supporting my pound amp easily and hasn t tilted back or fallen over i m glad i bought it and would buy from the company again thank you bought this for my kona k acoustic it fits and holds well on the guitar with the leather ends its adjustable with a pick pocket simple good quality would by another bought this strap for use with my dean evo electric it s very nice and durable though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavy duty it works great though and for the price it s wonderful while on the surface the pocket sounds great the picks either fall out because they aren t pushed in far enough or they are impossible to grab because they are pushed in too far there is also a tendency for the picks to fall out when you put the guitar on a stand which is a bit annoying the strap itself is just fine and is a good price but the pocket idea sounded better on paper than it works in real life i have never played a string instrument and it looks like i ll be able to get the hang of this very quickly only problem is the strings sting one play s dead meaning it will not stay in tune not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon nice for the price practical everyday useable money well spent on this one for sure glad i did it very well finished everything except rubber is made of aluminum with little bit of metal i guessnot like other reviewer said it fits in your hand comfortable does not need lot of strength to openit may be hard for old man or kidalso rubber doesnt smell that bad i mean it does but its not seriousthey also used glue to stick rubber cheap crappy strap it s too stiff not comfortable at all i regret purchasing this save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar they are expensive but worth it i ve got effects hooked up to this thing it fits beautifully and powers all of them at once have no problems with this i recommend it works great i have the same effect on my alesis midi keyboard as i do with my more expensive yamaha keyboard which has a sustain pedal chrome is great quality and it has good weight so it s not tinny i bought these because i am constantly loosing screws when i change pickguards or do new builds these are exactly what the doctor ordered original equipment so they re the right screws a must have for every guitarist no matter what brand you own as they work on everything these are well made and don t strip when screwing in for the first time if it s a new project always drill pilot holes anyway i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used almost time to order another set i store them in a little sandwich bag stars this is a great winder steel shaft will probably last one of these should come standard issue with every guitar this is my first guitar belt it is not a good fit the connection to the guitar is far too thick i try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage other than that it is usable sort of but i am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with it s well made and is fine as straps go but the pick pocket isn t much use the picture implies that it hold the pick so that it s partially exposed and easy to grab however the pocket is bigger that this and fairly loose so that picks tend to fall out when taking the strap off i am pleased with this guitar strap and feel it will do great for the young musician in our home the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end appropiately priced good value not fancy but who needs a fancy strap for a guitar arrived before projected delivery date the leather ends are very stiff and very difficult to use takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar well here s what i have to say this strap is much shorter than im used to but seeing how i bought this for an off guitar that s ok they really should put the length in the description the length is max where i like my straps to be max it is a hard strap to get on the guitar i do not suggest getting this strap withdunlop dual design straplok system nickel these are great locks but almost impossible to install on this strap overall great buy for a cheap little money saver if you need a simple normal length strap this should work fine however if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side this is not what you need i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball black polypro strapinstead very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist again not a bad strap just not for us tall guys nice strap for the price looks nice and quality seems nice like the pic holder on front of the strap i ordered with my new guitar these straps are quite flexible length wise so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn t get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position you will not be disappointed here i had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought i was doing a good job after i used the snark my guitar sounds so much better i will never be without one again the snark is easy to use and shows you positively when the guitar is in tune i was first exposed to the hercules locking mechanism when our praise band leader brought in his hercules two guitar stand and i tried it with both my full size string guitar and my string banjo i was impressed when i decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room amateur studio i was excited to find that the same hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall hanger models i put them on my wish list where my son daughter in law found them and bought three for me for christmas this last weekend i just finished putting them up and i m completely satisfied with their solid construction they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably i used the provided screws which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls i probably wouldn t trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall but instead get something more substantial to mount it like a toggle anchor what i m happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments the opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and string guitars but not so wide as to not support my string banjo i ve submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical string guitars and string banjo my friend plays gretch semi hollow body and fender solid body and other electric guitars with his hercules guitar stand so i assume they would also work with the wall hangers i am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars this is a nice strap it s kinda hard to get on the st time because it s stiff that turned out to be good good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat it would be sad if your axe fell in your soup very nice quality inexpensive guitar strap a little tough to get on that just means it s not going to come off with use just make sure it is all the way on before you start using it using this on my ibanez art electric guitar the pick pocket is a nice extra i acquired this recently i did not need another strat style or copy of but it s white just gotta love that vibe anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good here s a few add ons in case it s routed hsh under the hood but looks tight think it s bucker size upgradable top and bottom didn t measure i like single coils the white is a poly finish love poly durable and crack fade resist and exquisite nicely done alder body but it s hefty alder like lb or so not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice too nice to change like i was thinking till i got it nice quality control on these really smooth rosewood board with med jumbo that s what i call anyway frets good fretting standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed no missed screw holes etc was set up with standard action etc out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc great fit and finish best i can tell its a standard f type plate if interested looks to be easy changer overall it s a solid piece assembled well for me the body and neck is what seals the deal better then most out there this range it is alder and hefty but durable i look to change most hardware in time so won t comment on that what s there is installed well things i forgot tuners wanna say mm standard import style seem good not legendary and tremelo whammy standard zinc block there s the must upgrade part it s standard string space import i got one pet peave it s steel or brass blocks a shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe best money ever spent i can t afford the gotoh or callahan stuff on this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you ll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better also the neck i say nice but i mean it s nicer than most in the shape it s slightly chunky c shape not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets it s beefier i have avg size hands i find it s a good fit in all if your looking in this price range it s nice and upgradable as you can or learn more good quality plastic and attractive and cheap replacement for any acoustic guitar slotted with taper and fits well in my bridges this is a great stand it looks the same as any other but it works great for about dollars what can i say about a guitar strap it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price this is a solid stand with good adjustability and a thick decent quality foam to cushion your guitar bass its only fault is its price amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good simply search for guitar stands on here and see for yourself great grip lasts a good long while terrific trippy pearl tones and azures my all time fave hip hip hooray very comfortable the soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish heavy duty but soft on the shoulder not cheap quality at all this will definitely last a long time cheaply made but functional keep a couple of these in the bag as spares they will be handy if you know who shows up to the gig without a strap my son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in europe during ww i needless to say i did not want to pass this on to him yet i figured he could start simpler i read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument it has a great tone its construction is solid i am sure this will give him years of entertainment this is not a toy a great addition to your mouth harp collection this isn t the best strap but it s affordable and pretty good for a beginner s guitar strap the pick holder on the strap is pretty neat however i don t find myself using it often the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar don t forget to buy strap locks you will need it these are really well made straps for the money the only problem i had was that i wished i had ordered more of them i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles it s also cheaper but works well i have a different brand which has a string and small hook but i find when adjusted correctly i cannot remove it this sling keeps the head loop large so you can get it off without a binch of hassle i find the hook to be wide though and could be alot better with a thinner hook i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these the price is great and it works very happy with this stand great hook supports a lot of weight looks good on any wall i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application i got of these for my electric guitars they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent do be careful when un folding as pinching of skin would be very easy the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well i have had no problem with the foam cushion so far i have modern finishes on my guitars i don t think i can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing my epiphone lp seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the turser strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include all in all these aren t bad not quite perfect but a good value for the money i m a gadget lover and this is a good one it makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument how a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesn t seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what i like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isn t always possible with that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding jim dunlop s purple colored big stubby mm picks i like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the big stubby certainly meets that criteria the sharp point and the pick s rounded edges help the stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking besides electric guitar i find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semi solid body guitars where the string tension is greater i had tried the mm stubby previously but the mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all i m still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly i find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky keeping the pick clean and dry does help my favorite pick had been thedunlop mm nylon pick but i am very pleased with the performance and feel of the mm stubby i can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick the pick pack contains picks i only paid which is simply an outstanding deal if you re a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty stubby a try easy to use does a great job and comes off when you want it to and does not scratch or harm guitar in any way great price as well i got two of them great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while i m not sure why a few people are putting these strings down i ve used them numerous times without any issues they last as long and sound as good as any other brands i ve played easy upgrade fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners make changing strings a whole lot easier glad i did it looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks the pick pocket is cool though i won t be using it the strap is very reliable the pick pocket is a nice touch but if playing for extended periods of times you might want to go with something more comfortable
286	this amp is non stop fun has so many features i head to the s and it has all the sounds i like for that decade it sounds great at low volume and has some amazing models that sounds like the real thing nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern it fits my ovation quite snuggly i bought some retainers but found them unnecessary so far i couldn t remove this strap if i wanted to well i could but its just too much work so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least the only thing i don t like about this strap is the edge of the strap is a bit abrasive on my bare neck not a problem in the cooler months when i m prone to sweaters and such but in the summer it takes a bit of getting used to it s made of a canvassy cotton so its strong but its also a little rough i m going to try waxing the edge with canning wax or candle wax and see if that smooths it down a bit it is a very nice strap and will last years i like it almost as much as my year old ace strap which is much softer due to odd years of use and abuse by a multitude of musicians but finding an old ace for anything close to this price is a fools journey buy one then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny you ll be ready it s a cable it works great i don t see any reason to spend more money on a short cable like this this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings we tried both over the strings it would slide below the nut which isn t good under the strings and it muffled a few so we kind of wove it above some and under others other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems and it puts the name martin on the lowliest box guitar in hindsight i d have probably just got a strap button and mounted it to the base of the neck but if you don t want to do that and hate the lace approach this will do the trick it may even fit better on different guitars ours is a year old norma that actually sound amazing considering its origins guess old wood just sounds better and the price is very right to be able to claim you own a martin lol just exactly as stated this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand holds picks it is exactly what i wanted for a great price thanks editing this review to say that today i got a few thin picks and the thin picks do not hold in this mediums do great but the thin fall right out fine for me because i will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone i have been playing for over three decades and it has been a while since i have owned an electric guitar i bought this amp along with a epi les paul all i can say is wow this is a great combination this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects well built and looks even better in person than the picture plenty of power as well better than anything including the stage quality amps like marshals from back in the day a great practice amp but good enough you could use it for a small gig going to pick up the optional foot switch if you buy you won t be disappointed i have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past years i just keep coming back to these the sound isn t quite as bright as the phosphorus bronze but it is more of a acoustic guitar sound anyway these are clear high quality and come sealed in tight plastic so the strings aren t exposed to air until you open them because of that little difference they do stay clean much longer than the brands simply wrapped in paper i just can t think of a single complaint i ve been playing for years and i own electric guitars all of my guitars are strung with d addario s they sound great when they re fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest i play at least hours per week so i put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings it s really the durability that sets these apart the amazon price is terrific i like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and i can buy a year s worth of these for the same price as set of bass strings i d definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon i was surprised by the size very small and unobtrusive my older guitar has a decal on the top of the head which made the small size a bit of an issue but with the cleverly designed swivel pad and wide opening on the clip of the snark i could still easily manage it the tuning is dead on and couldn t be more convenient since it s based on vibration the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise also you don t have to try and balance anything on your knee or use a table to hold your standard audio tuner just clip it on and swivel the head to face you i really like the design attractive but not overly loud in color and a nice non slip surface the display is bright and the interface is very intuitive you just press the button and start plucking strings in addition snark s customer service was very friendly and helpful putting my two cents aside that anyone who plays the guitar should learn to tune by sound without a tuner given one of the notes i highly recommend the snark tuner i have one of these for a lanikai tenor and one for a stagg soprano the soprano one fits great even though it s a different brand perfect
287	a great little amplifier good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around i replaced the stock speaker with an eminence rajun cajun which has improved the tone and provided increased volume the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs i would highly recommend i love this boost pedal so much i owned the mxr micro amp for a while but i found that it colored my tone way too much too much low end the mc on the other hand doesn t color your tone at all it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords if you re in the market for a boost or a buffer i d look no further this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing i installed this in a super champ x as others have pointed out you ll have to turn the treble down after installing it that s because it s designed for making solos stand out i e for adding punch if you re a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing however if you mostly play rhythm i d stick with the stock speaker i want to put two of these into my x blues deville to increase its range and make solos sing while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut i have several other good cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level i have grown as a musician to the point that i know it s worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables yes you can get many cables way cheaper and i m all for getting things at a good price publishers clearing house has not visited me yet but this is a case of you get what you pay for simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer watt amp gave the amp more low end and made everything much clearer i would and do recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their super champ sound and like other people have said the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting i had to turn the amp down two notches two number to have the same volume level out of the amp if my super champ was stolen i d buy a new one and put this speaker in it wouldn t even think twice about it what makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to pedals it comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip one of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don t stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks takes up less room on your pedal board also the plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss it can put out up to ma which is how it can run up to pedals a great item at a great price no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more
288	i just received these cables today and the packaging they come in is quite simple however there are two zip ties that secure the cables together so you will need to be careful when cutting them not to damage the cable itself with your knife or scissors these are value cables after all however they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use i like how audio technica made something like an xlr cable look so pleasing to the eyes as for quality so far i ve been getting a clean signal even with my cheap pyle pro pdmic i had to replace the cable that came with that mic because it was really that awful hopefully the at value cable will hold up i ll update this review if anything happens if your looking for a decent cable for a low price i would give these a try i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig i am a bass player by trade though i dabble with many other instrument as many of us do i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows when the sound system is adequate via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals and then to the mixer i use the at xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables this cable at least in its form sounds just as good as my mogami silver xlr i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic i have several i don t have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables on short i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones if i want better i would shop around and pay more does the job for now this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices armed with a set of headphones i can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my mp s mp player plugged in too worth the small price you pay as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on i m sure if i drop it even from a low height that door s flying off along with the battery i use this for my desk mic i use for recording it is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality especially for this price definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future
289	i have some neurological problems with my picking hand and can t seem to hold onto picks i really like these max grips a lot and have found that they are excellent for soloing great tone as well for my tastes they are are a bit stiff for strumming but perfect for everything else i love the size and wouldn t want anything larger the advantage of these over the dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip you can still pick with them the davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic as i ve been on an electric fixation lately also a fan of the regular jazz iiis and find they don t slip as much as my dunlop tortex picks i think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering still in terms of grip they don t hold a candle to the max grips both picks have their own unique tonal character i ve tried a variety of picks and i think that once you get used to smaller picks you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics they are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is blues oriented surprised there are so few reviews edit the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle it s getting easier with these i have also since found that while these are fantastic picks i actually prefer thedunlop jazz iii pick pack red nylon mmdespite lack of the max grip raised lettering they are just the most wonderful picks i ve used i do plan to try out some mm picks however as i suspect i m going to prefer a thicker pick the iii nylons feels slightly thicker than the max grips which i believe is why i prefer them i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews when i use my music stand i just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job this is that device i leave it on my stand and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger and it s on and i can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the snark head tuners in addition this one has a metronome i like this very much and may well buy another enjoy just to confirm several other reviews these hangers are really nice they add a nice look to your room and they perform a much needed function very well as other have said though the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and i don t recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywall even my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall so there s no way i d trust any of my proper guitars to these things i bought some heavy duty anchors from the local diy store you can get them from amazon tootoggler snaptoggle ba toggle bolt with bolts usa made for fastener size pack of and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw much better i have a few of these holding up a les paul type a strat a godin and a g l tele and they ve been holding up pun intended fine for a few weeks now very solid and i feel comfortable hanging my taylor ce in this easy to remove the guitar and easy to put the guitar back in and always feels secure great item watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the yeti microphone works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises larger than i expected this a great cable for practicing at home coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles this product measures approx coiled plug end to plug end thus it is pretty short even when stretched out for me it is the perfect length for at home use especially when using two amp pedal board guitar not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore i just ordered mine two weeks ago nothing fancy about this strap unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end just well made and functional i got this for my grandson s squier by fender size acoustic it doesn t have a strap button at the top end it would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut but i work with leather and i found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand very durable and flexible if you are looking for something nice and strong get this cables i put this on my fender jazz bass after i bought a new neck for it this plate work the exact same as the stock plate but it dresses the bass up a bit this is not a mod that people will see like pickup covers but i like the way it looks when i pick it up to play i did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area and look like i make very good choice i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these the schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where i had to oil them a few times a month or i d end up with an audible creak hands down i like the dunlop ones more they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure no problems whatsoever i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago i m a total convert every new guitar i get is going to get a set of these put on it
290	excellent picks with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth the only problem i have is that i keep changing my mind between whether i want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing these are a great addition to any mandolin player s case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a fender heavy i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well they are easy to install on the bass and the strap i m another reviewer who has upon personal inspection discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar i returned it i ve first act brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed i use this capo all the time on both instruments a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also i did and they love it
291	i won t rant about a string winder they aren t that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter i do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but i am not going to be that picky this unit works just fine and i am sure that i will lose it before it breaks i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive lighter than a full boom i have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar this little device gives me auto correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren t overbearing and the pitch correction sounds really natural now i just need more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound it s a short boom but it works great i really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of pa equipment on a cart aside from the two speaker stands i can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles i don t expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart so i m assuming the stitching is more than sufficient at this bag looks like a great value very nice pop filter i use it on all my condenser mics it works perfect for those hard p s and strong s sounds it s built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals and it looks very professional i wouldn t be on the mic without it now that i know of the big difference it makes having it
292	the evans pedal patch will work for you great it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty i cheap buy and it works excellent wow wow i can t believe it working wonderful i m using it karaoke online in paltalk i did compairation with somes i have it s perfect vocal i connected it with mixer alesis input i wish it s built with switch on offrecomend to buyer thanks amazon all joking aside these heads really are great tune em right and you ll get a nice warm tone from them that s unmatched with other brands wuhan makes great products for the money i have the medium crash and so i decided to try the both are great cymbals for the buck if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the s or s nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it the is a bit warmer than the the sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the bought wuhans the ride and a splash will review each one as they come in from amazon why the stars well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close if your on a budget like i am go for wuhans i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years this is a really good product and excellent crash wuhan really impresses me there are some great video s of wuhans on you tube you should really check those out before buying wuhans or any cymbal for that matter i am very pleased with this crash i ve always liked behringer products there prices are pretty reasonable and the quality cant be beat i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one
293	my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special harps i guess i should have paid attention to the other and star ratings these harps have no volume don t waste your money on them i guess the only thing worth having is the case but the case has no handles or carry strap i said the case had no handle well i take that back there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside i was using a kyser capo until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn t hold all the strings down i thought i d try something else out and settled on this one it s easy to take on and off it s tight enough the main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so i think it will fit even the widest fretboards i don t know about a or string though i use this with a behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music it was just what i needed to give me clean sound running it through the usb not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like i was in a studio i highly recommend it disappointing was looking for to receiving these but mostly they are unplayable leak air badly easier learning bagpipes than these things save your money and get some harps that actually work decent case though hohner marine band hohner special and lee oskar major diatonic harps fit well in this case hohner s big river harp does not fit properly in the case it is longer than the others and doesn t snug in i ll either return the case or order two lee oskars to replace my two big river models or i can just deal with the fact that they don t fit quite properly but probably good enough decisions decisions haven t played the toy harps yet first things first i bought the case for the case not for the included harps my revised review after about a year of use the one thing i hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out so if you re not careful your guitar will fall it is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap once every few days my original review very easy to install didn t require drilling i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes although it looks a little bit big and clunky it s a small price to pay for stability i probably will get another set but may get the black ones instead of the silver because i think the black color may hide the clunkyness a little better overall a very good product i have other harmonica s but thought i d like a set of blues harps i thought that if it s made by hohner it must be fairly good wow was i wrong too hard to push notes through them i wouldn t recommend these to anyone
294	i tried these on my talyor ga e and the sound was just a bit to bright the heavier bass strings didn t really add the bassy sound i was hoping for just more of a thud ymmv well made capo works as designed on my acoustic easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings just wish it had a spring so it could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it this is a pretty cool product i have mine next to my computer because i am constantly waiting on video to render and i am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand it is also good to have when i am using garage band and need to set the guitar down for a second if you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it won t work the guitar wobbles and falls out but it works great on carpet the pick bucket is a nice touch keeps picks from scattering all over my desk the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves i would recommend this tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar they are basic standard traditional strings they sound good they are light weight on this guitar they sound a bit too bright my preference is to use elixirs prefer the feel and sound on this guitar elixir polyweb acoustic guitar strings light these strings do not last less time than the elixirs mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar some people like a brand new set before every gig others will go weeks or months before changing if you are an every gig person well the martin set is probably perfect for you they are much less expensive than others leaving strings in for an extended period elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style so for the price these are an excellent value crikey where to begin firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet secondly they mismarked one of the packets so it appeared i had two d strings instead of two e strings lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible they were tinny and clangy sounding i ve never heard worse strings fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med light as well i replaced the godawful martins with the ernie ball s and they were far far better shame on martin for such a piss poor product i ll never buy their strings again these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again martin is a name that means quality after reading all the great reviews i moved to these light medium strings from the light gauge they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy finger slides are much harder with these strings the lower strings e a g just don t slide as easily until there is some buildup in them as a result my fingers get out of position and don t hit clear notes until i ve slid those areas a couple of times that s probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them the packaging was also a bit confusing since there are two strings to an envelope it seems i too easily get the strings reversed on set up other string makers i have tried color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up overall good strings and i ll probably buy them again
295	these are the best strings around last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern i ve been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far i use it boost my jazz bass to the same volume level as my precision it does the job perfectly the led is really bright which for me is a good thing but others might find distracting also it would convenient if there were external switches instead of internal dip switches for varying the settings but in such a small footprint there are bound to be tradeoffs i d buy this again for sure they re days on and sound fantastic already i ve come to expect nothing but excellence from elixirs they re the best i ve played on to date whether electric or acoustic i very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box i ve used these on the reg for a year obviously there are better sounding monitors out there but these are really great for what you pay for imo i d recommend these to someone trying to save some money updatetwo years in with continued regular use they sound just as good as they did a year ago these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex we ve tried d addario brighter sound d addario acoustic guitar strings set exp lite and martin a little stiff martin strings sp phosphor bronze msp in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar the difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nano s have a very light coating that you almost don t feel so if you like standard not coated strings the nano s are probably the way to go if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar for the combination we have these are outstanding strings on the strings lasting longer that s hard to say fresh strings do sound better it s clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non coated strings but i m not certain these last so much longer we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability corrosion or crud on the string isn t the sole factor in changing strings elixir is a wonderful company on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesn t perform up to your standard the other amazing thing i ve watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and i m still very confused the elixir website it s pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes it is so simple and so reproducible i love this technique elixir strings are the best i have ever used they sound great and last far longer tonally than anything else i have tried this is my first amp which i am using with my new applause ae rrb acoustic electric guitar also purchased from amazon the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp my only complaint is that as a first time amp owner user i needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with no paperwork at all not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit i received i downloaded the users manual from the pyle website but it was also not much help but just by trying different settings i have managed to find what for me is the sweet spot for my guitar when paired with this amp very happy with the amp and also happy that i spent the extra few dollars to get the amp rather than the amp version i ve owned a seymour duncan woody for several months now and have had a chance to try it out with various amps with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end and so on this is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as you re likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup the one thing i ve found is that i get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the woody through my ampeg bass amp than through my peavey guitar amp the high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and there s a tendency for distortion to creep in even with the clean setting through the bass amp though the tone is absolutely clean and clear the pickup is easy enough to install and remove and it s easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesn t interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would the other great feature of this pickup is the look the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar if you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup this is the one to buy lately i have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings to the less and also most expensive strings i find the elixir excellent my testing is ongoing and cannot give the elixir a top rating yet that may change along the way however i believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine what may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else s palate therefore strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else s ear my ears remain attentive to future string sounds i also love the d addario make which i purchase through amazon always this is definately worth the money i was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all bought another one for my friend way better than stock strings that i received with my fender acoustic i am a beginner guitar player but i was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers got these because i wanted some extra capos around they work fine and are a great price they do seem to be a little hard to open spring seems a little tight good deal as back up capos they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a very long time and their sound is great these strings are not focused on performance but endurance best string i ve ever played this is an amazing pedal delay flanger phaser tremolo pitch shifter all sound really good and completely adjustable only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time for the price this is a steal behringer rocks i have no complaints except when i try to tune my guitar a half step down there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but i have zero clue how to use them this tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head swiveling head visible from wherever you are alright i got tired of forking over cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online and let me tell you these picks get the job done don t expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that a few of the tips broke off but i think that s my fault for playing too hard great picks would recommend to anyone i d chose this cable cause i own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end i like the idea that you can cut the power and remove the cable from the instrument with having mute the amp or mixer i recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else i have never been much of a fan for coated strings i normally use daddario ej s but i do like these elixirs after about weeks of playing they are starting to fade not stay in tune and i notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole they do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround
296	i am very disappointed the guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body it is unusable until repaired update it has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller amazon and have not received any communication i can t find a single complain about this amp the amp modelling is fantastic plug in for a mic cd m player quality driver i m not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website i used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds but you can t ask for much more for the price of you won t be disappointed with this amp i have been using an old elastic bar capo for years because the last spring capo i used did not have nearly enough tension when i first applied the planet waves tri action capo i thought here we go again there was ample tension e g but b and e were buzzy as all get out not expecting much i adjusted the tension it took a couple of tries to get it just right but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar zero buzz across the board that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze on and off it looks nice i have the black version as well as its comparative ease on the wallet and this capo is a rock solid five star product this capo also has a pick holder the feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo s overall size and shape but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself get this capo
297	a very attractive and well constructed strap i ve been somewhat disappointed with some of the more expensive straps but this one is excellent and not so expensive all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly does what it is supposed to do it is pretty good quality and durable too quick simple and efficient i would definitely buy again highly recommended i like it this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments like all other pedals it s not the pedal seems like you always need another one but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone after you ve settle on a setting you like it adds a subtle but noticeable addition to your sound guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok will need to check them next week or so wanted to hang my guitars on the wall these hooks are padded and rotate a little provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars the difficulty in installing was i wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud i had to attach them to a wood board that i attached to the wall this also provided a additiional separation from the wall the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
298	this is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder why didn t i think of that it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down every few weeks keeps the strings clean and best of all i don t find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since i started using this instead of the cheesecloth i used to use i have had a korg ca tuner for a few years which i really like i wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit initially i bought a boss tu for more money but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the korg tm and the batteries rattled around in their compartment also i like having the middle green led for tuning the price here can t be beat and it s a well built item that works great i was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much but they take more pressure that it would seem and there is a delay until it turns on or off so that turned out not to be an issue i am not real hot for the color but it s nicely made and works well so i will live with it i especially like the little folding stand in the back rather than having to find an old credit card like this camo capo s simplicity and its unique color my friend got a new one after seeing me using it but his is a bit shorter than mine mine works both uke acoustic guitar i have no problem to use it on single hand as the manufactor suggests for its duration i don t clip it on the guitar when it s not in use i ve been buying dunlop pick for at least years now and i love the feel and the grip the picks last for a really long time and i would recommend getting several thickness for different applications but for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick i am quite pleased with this product it s relatively inexpensive small and light weight it operates on two aa batteries included i use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily i should have ordered the cm clip on tuner at the same time placed a separate order later to allow to tune in a noisy music jam or band environment you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings there is also a note sound generator built in for reference pitches the metronome is pretty loud for the small size i have a hearing loss so if i can hear it even while playing it must be pretty good the speeds are from bpm you can select between two modes pendulum step preset values etc or full step which allows you to change incrementally by one etc beat tap allows you change the time signature from beats and also duplets triplets quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats it has a mini earphone jack for private use it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously i bought mine from austin bazaar shipping was free and fast i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration this is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of people it produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you don t want to be too loud it has a headphone jack also i like this so much i might experiment with miking it for gigs never thought i would say that about a watt fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one there is an overdrive on off button with adjustable gain volume control and a simple treble bass equalizer other then that it is all rock physically it is built strong too as an acoustic guitar player i think this is a great product i had previously been using the korg ga which is a fine basic tuner the ga works like many basic guitar tuners where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning or with one two or three flats but the tm works by just showing the pitch you re currently playing among any of the reference pitches making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler now i use the tm at home as my main tuner and the ga rides around in my case both great products works well since i got it i didn t change battery for more than months very good rosin and does exactly what is described a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows no need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity had this strap for years now and still going on strong just a simple well made product that does the job perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest looks classic too cool little light but three minor gripes the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy and the light is a little on the dim side but i think it ll work well overall and i like the fact that it s so compact and portable
299	works well easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers i ve had erm it does what it say it would do the nice thing about the super is its size in turn and its ability to hold more water these are great i have these on all my guitars only problem is the clip on install to the strap if you can t get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place once installed you are good for life it s cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well i would recommend this if not this one at least buy some kind of cleaner polish protect your investment
300	great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal true bypass knobs and switch are sturdy great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped no brutalzzz there are better pedals to cop the scooped or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing but you can get close with the right amp eq and this thing dimed i agree with another reviewer this thing has a very high output so be forewarned the first time you plug in unity is around o clock on the level knob it gets thumbs up for the sound price ratio if you don t mind a longer shipping time these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web this was my fourth joyo pedal and i believe joyo and the dano cool cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of price quality although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal i was recording in an hour had the software on my mac talking to it it sounds great with little of it s own noise the percussion loops are fine at least provide solid guides for recording i have a gnx that i love as far as this pedal goes i am just as happy i echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over fiddling with the small knobs update the software works well is very useful it loaded right up with no problem memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once i start using the pedal more often that s the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal more than worth it though these strings are my second choice after the elixir bronze they are warmer sounding well balanced cost a lot but well worth it to me this dual splitter works perfect i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings the most important part of video is the audio you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal i always say half of video is audio for years i used to run a line directly out of the dj s mixer to get my audio the issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking often though the signal is to hot the music is crap or the dj says something stupid with just the dj s voice i can edit the way i want and compress time this product has improved my productions beyond it s price sold i use them to run a separate clean audio line from a dj s wireless systems to my own audio recorder they work perfectly and haven t failed me once for those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky bitey blues material think albert collins this will likely add a little and i mean a little extra oomph to your sound it sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling but you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a hughes and kettner statesman or watt amp too just running it straight to me from what i have heard it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music it definitely doesn t add any more fatness so my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased vitamin e regimen in other words this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are most musicians already use eq and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you re getting out of this pedal i think i m not going to do any explaining about the science behind how this pedal works i m just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone this definitely isn t a boost and it s also not an eq the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone essentially this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing the lo contour knob doesn t increase the amount of bass produced by the amp rather it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass and low mid tone to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased but it hasn t you re just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh that s not to say that you can t dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something indeed it ll make those searing lead tones even better now i gave this product stars not because i ve had any issues with it or haven t been in any way unsatisfied with it but rather because it s really a fairly subtle effect at first i almost couldn t tell a difference between having it on and off with time i ve been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone but it doesn t make a night and day difference i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you re happy with and just want to make it even better this pedal won t make a cheap watt solid state combo sound like a tube half stack it won t make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before in conclusion though i definitely wouldn t put this pedal into the must have category it definitely improves the quality of my tone this is a pedal that i leave on all the time as it improves both clean and distorted tones this thing works great i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable accurate and quick great for between song quick tuning it s a boss pedal so it is rugged and reliable i have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros recording artists and session musicians in and around the dallas and north texas area i play locally and regionally in north texas and see this pedal on almost every guitarist and bassist s boards every night great product well made worth every penny update after using this tuner for a month i can say that i made the right decision fantastic product that every guitar player needs period edit i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board these really are the best tuners out there you should get one today there is no comparison to anything else out there nothing i have looked works as advertised the cutter makes this thing really worth while if i lose it i m buying another more words required
301	seem to work well keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one these are great they re small light weight easy to read accurate inexpensive this one offers an additional feature tap tempo metronome such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes worth every penny mind you does require some length and height adjustment for some epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put so far so good i ve had this stand for about years and have used it on stage for the last years pretty steady the first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and i immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it it s plastic plastic and cold don t mix the retainer piece broke and went flying and i was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig i managed to get it back together but now i have to be very careful when extending the neck the other part that i ve been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks it has come up completely off and i must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off i won t mark this stand less then stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions which is very good advice long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod great for linking close quarter effect pedals no noise and very durable great product for the price i would recommend buying they sound great they helped revive an old acoustic guitar that had been buried in a closet for years along with a very thorough cleaning i don t have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers i honestly didn t notice anything different i bought them because i wanted great strings on an old cheap guitar in order to get the best sound possible these strings did that just fine the guitar now sounds great job completed
302	this is one of the cleanest sounding mini amps you ll find mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound it does sound tinny through the speaker but am radio sounded just as bad through speakers i hated it at first until i plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the o drive knob very clean but i could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar s volume knob turning the o drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp i m building a speaker cab with a jensen speaker just for this amp according to many reports it will drive a x cab it is a good purchase i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job i would like the plate to be heavier seems a little flexy this is watt walkman size guitar amplifier the controls are volume off tone and overdrive it also has a headphone jack in my honest opinion it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you the speaker sound is fine for a clean sound like jazz or country or semi distorted and more rock if your looking for an small amp that will do metal this may not be for you defintely get the danelectro da ac power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick overall it s pretty good if you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks i said good not loud loud enough yes i suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time this is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased great color and retro style as well i have been a gigging guitarist for over years now i own all the coveted amps guitars fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town i ve used all the roland cubes that are battery powered they were just fine on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone i d read some good reviews and isnt much money i was shocked going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones but in my gig i have been using a boss me with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc looper and lastly my phone with all my backing tracks i play rythm leads and sing in my gig i connected all this to the single input of the n put volume and tone the same od turned off the sound is rich full and imho sounds just as good as my roland cube street i have all the volume i need and great tone the v battery lasts the entire hr set i am amazed by this amp one doesn t get much better than d addario strings in my opinion they re twice as clear as martin strings and the exps just last forever i like the standard phosphor bronze just as well and use those as a less expensive alternative i certainly recommend d addario nylon strings on classical guitars i ve heard no other string that has the crisp clean rich sound of this brand of strings i ve used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand but always come back to this one different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending on the guitar you use i prefer this mid range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone any lighter and the guitar sounds tinny any heavier and i fear strings putting undue stress on the neck these are just right
303	this little amp kicks major ass dood i think i may have blown the speaker or it s just how it sounds but it s great for a lo fi kind of fuzz e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up the clean tone is really nice too a little to bright for my taste but for a mini clip amp it s not too bad i can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away theres a headphon jack a v power supply and that s in for plug ins no line in so you can t plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well if you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great i purchased this mic to use for screencasts recording what s happening on my pc s screen while i talk about it i set it up to sit on my desktop approximately away from me and usedcamtasia studio download and a free program called camstudio to test it out both programs worked well with the mic and did what i d hoped it would do eliminated my need for a clunky wired mic headset the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic i love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop s monitor kinks in my system muffled audiothe included software cakewalk s music creator le can be installed on one computer you get days to register it i installed it and registered it immediately but it would not allow me to put in my registration code saying i wasn t the system administrator i am and my windows pc says i am but alas it wouldn t work this software is optional but i decided to install it prior to the microphone per instructions to try it out eventually i ended up uninstalling it soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue muffled audio recording no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it i was stumped then i decided to go to the samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic the generic ones installed were from no luck i began reading online about muffled audio on windows pcs somewhere i noticed a name i recognized realtek which was a name associated with my speakers on my pc realtek digital audio i went to the realtek site and noted updated drivers for windows bit and decided to download and install them i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem i did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording afterwards i tested out the mic using camtasia and camstudio both worked beautifully with the samson go mic on my desk at a distance of about this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts no hiss hum breath noises or distortion very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio works perfectly with the usb connection on my powered usb hub conclusion buy it for great recordingsthis mic is a truly great if it s recognized and properly configured by your system impressively clear recordings unlike any i ve been able to obtain using aplantronics audio usb multimedia headsetor the mic on mymicrosoft lifecam cinema p hd webcam black for the price i don t think you can do better it s compact has great voice pick up and audio recording clarity installation issues may occur but updating audio drivers using a powered usb hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you ve been hoping for at a price that s right update been using this mic consistently for a couple months and i m liking it it s a condenser mic and doesn t filter out ambient noise as well as i d like however for an under forty dollar purchase i m still very happy with it cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it i guess if anything that s been the downside to this purchase look it s a plastic box that s just square and deep with a cheap three inch speaker inside it produces decent sound although there s substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital static from my computer it s ok as a practice amp but i certainly wouldn t want to perform with it in short it s only a small step above toy level which is what you d expect for a twenty dollar amp that doesn t mean it s not useful but you need to be realistic about what you re getting here very smart handy design that my acoustic guitar doesn t have to be drilled a hole for it s very easy to buckle the guitar strap on the neck its botton button of the guitar that is i own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over drive i love it it s got tone galore i play either a martin a e thru it or a strat knock off either one sounds awesome never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for battery life seems ok but i hate messing with batteries so i d buy power supply you can get a v supply check for proper polarity at the thrift store for a buck don t even think about it get it is pocket change this snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use even for my children and works well the display is easy to understand and is very accurate confirmed by our guitar teacher s meter the snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish everything should be this easy to use and work this well highly recommended cfh nice bag padding it good i just wish the hooks weren t plastic not shore how long they will last inexpensive light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar folds up and can easily be stored highly recommend this for the guitar player based on other reviews i made my purchase this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough two downsides both are about the noise i live on the th floor as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio i mean very loud radio background and i couldn t get ride of it this is the only thing that annoys me but i think it depends on where people live when this is not properly tuned it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise other than the radio part none of these are major issues as a mini amp you can t really expect that much not to mention it s not expensive at all overall i like it and i would recommend it by the way this unit comes with a v battery i got this to power my danelectro honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy it s a power adaptor so it isn t too exciting but it works fine nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound no too much heat and easy plug for instant job great gig bag for acoustic guitar very well made with good padding it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps it fits the guitar nicely i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag the strap and picks were an added bonus a great value it is a fun little practice amp and i agree with the praise it gets the positives have been covered so i ll point out a few minor things i don t like first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying the rest of the controls are on top why do i have to grope around the back to find the most important button plus i keep it in a cabinet so i have to pull it out to turn it on and off next i wish they d just name the settings clean overdrive distortion and so on jc clean black panel brit combo and r fier mean nothing to me then there s another minor annoyance that the input is recessed a degree angle plug won t fit unless you run it around the back lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means it s heavy not heavy like i can t pick it up just heavy for something called a micro amp none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini recently i was building a telecaster project a friend recommended using the way switch instead of the stock way switch this allows you to have the three positions normally found on a telecaster bridge only bridge neck in parallel and neck only it also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in series the result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge neck position and a slightly higher top end output this is clearly a case of your mileage may vary i ve been used to the traditional position switch on my other telecasters i m a bit indifferent to this mod if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again it does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the way however i would not change out a working way switch for this for me the added benefit just isn t worth the effort i have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it tried too light and high and too deep not good for popping but is right in the middle perfect i wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands there is of course very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny but hey it s just a volt battery i just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device they put a lot of thought into this amp and it is outstanding for the budget price keep in mind you can patch another volt powered device through this one to enhance it i will at some point run my boss digital delay box through it to check that out the belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice and i got it in red as a change of pace because i always get black with my equipment it looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character nice product danelectro i got this amp for my year old son along with a squire mini strat verry good combination my son loves them both i buy and sell electric guitars and often i meet with someone at a half way point where access to electricity is unavailable i was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small there is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter i bought a planet waves v power adapter to go with the honey tone it might work in a busker situation don t get me wrong this is a great little amp for practicing but it eats batteries like they were candy i think it was like or three hours of playing and i had to throw in new batteries but if playing on the street corner is your thing this little amp has a belt clip luv it i had version and this amp isnt much different they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one and it is not a toy don t be misled by the price this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics and while it may not be a marshall stack it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town the tone has been fairly pure although with a mike at least i can also get some pops crackles and squeals this is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp so the honey tone is not at fault in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input i ve used it with a high impedance mike astatic jt a low impedance mike behringer xm and electric guitar fender stratocaster it handles these without noticeable signal loss what is this amp exactly my guess is that danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox added a watt amplifier circuit and put the whole shebang into a retro case the result is quite appealing and the overall look and feel is one of quality the case is solid albeit plastic the three controls volume tone and overdrive while not detented have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components the input inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid someone in danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit s leather strap though it is more decorative than useful if you can operate an overdrive stompbox then you know how to work this amp the volume control is obvious the tone control alters the bass treble mix but not very significantly in my opinion the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree the instructions describe sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you as i said this is small but really not a toy i ve personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it s so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable and when i decide that i m good enough to panhandle in penn station this baby is going with me not much to say if you play guitar buy one you ll never be out of tune again lets you tune anytime i never even take mine off no more does this sound in tune because it will always be in tune so do your self a favor and go out and buy one very affordable you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hours so enjoy i usually play classical nylon string guitar but have an ovation deep bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out i never have found strings that i really liked don t ask me why i never thought about contacting ovation and asking them what they use from the factory one of those duh things i didn t even think of until just now based on reviews and questions answered here on amazon i purchased this triple set of strings instant gratification first they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days but these retained tune fairly well the sound is excellent the playability comfy the tone of my ovation was back here are my itemized observations first three sets for currently cannot beat the value for price brilliance what many people call bright brilliance is the opposite of dull some strings sound dull right out of the package these strings are brilliant bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar tone the natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through no hint of tinniness plunk or twang mellow mellow is difficult to define but the best definition i ve heard is ah that sounds nice mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar it s a pleasantness that doesn t grate on your ears when you pluck a string these strings are medium mellow just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep balance at first the e overtoned the b and e but as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out the trebles became clearly audible while the e and a provided just the right touch of bass comfort the mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action these strings are just right especially the mm e which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming summary these are excellent strings which doesn t surprise me since i ve use d addario classical guitar strings for years martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow d addario just shines thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try highly recommended
304	i love this capo let me tell you about my capo journey where i ve used every brand while searching for this one first i always owned the old dunlop toggle action capo which is just old tech you know where it s just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber the kind one used to use before i had to go back to that when my first planet waves black thermoplastic capo broke don t buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca each one i bought broke one broke within a week during the winter rainy days so i loved those capos they were perfect but i was done with the breaking so i figured i d try others instead despite my love for the planet waves design i didn t know about the silver aluminum one yet well i hated each other one i tried kyser if you have had carpal and or are small handed you know what i mean you don t want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don t want to play the guitar i really hate the kysers i know some folks love to squeeze and use them that s fine different strokes right then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me omg that thing is so ridiculous it pops off it wiggles about it is tricky i hate it now i know many folks are schub fans who give me a drive by downrate i m not saying it isn t great for those who love it if you love the schub you love it unconditionally and i respect that all i m saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me there are other models that fail similarly to these they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands like the g i did fall in love with it until maybe the th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on awk ward and painful sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby but if you have carpal you know what i mean you want to go easy on the hands and arms and not brutalize them the other thing i ve always hated about the kysers and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder that s just dumb kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don t mind it or claim it doesn t do that but you know what i m talking about ok so then because of all the broken planet waves thermoplastic capos i turned next to dunlop s turnscrew models i liked them they are very similar to the pw design but the screw location is more awkward to use and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model this is it right here the silver one is excellent and it s made of aluminum not thermoplastic i bought one and it has lasted me almost years now without a single problem by now in contrast i would have run through or thermoplastic ones i want to say that if you are performing in a public venue never use the thermoplastic ones because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room and could easily poke someone s eyes out not kidding don t use those in public situations back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo i love it because it doesn t break not at all and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc the great features are ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos this capo fits so easily simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches unlike the other screwtops or all other capos there s no need for any moving around adjusting the guitar falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar sheesh none of that nonsense you put it on and they ve engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on move it from fret to fret put it where you want and screw it in with great ease wow best ever in this category ease of use is tops ever it will never hurt you it only helps it weighs nothing is easy to carry you can slip it onto the peg area it just is so light i still can t believe how light it feels it does what it s supposed to that other capos don t do no issues with being in tune just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire no wrestling around like some capos do the screw is in the most easy location and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn t hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew it s a breeze no problems with the size it s so small it doesn t get in your way on the fretboard you won t have to do hand yoga in order to play capo d songs it is flat i know what a concept a capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords not pretzeled twister instead of chords now i play capo d songs all the time because of this capo and it is so much fun musically a whole new magical experience the truth i ve found is that good equipment matters in music making i never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until i got my first applause guitar with great action i have a yamaha i love now since the applause necks break but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that s easy to use in the case of guitars great action is imperative in the case of capos ease of use and no pain produced is imperative and it opens up the world of capo use the magic of the mathematics of music theory if you love the other brands don t diss me i know it s perfect for you and i m happy for you that it works perfectly for you because when you have the best one for you you will shine with your music and i will enjoy listening to you play but those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what i m talking about you won t settle for the torture of kysers and schubs gotta be kidding me i bought every capo imaginable need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile but ended up that i was using the old toggle type again instead until i found the aluminum silver planet waves capo planet waves has made the perfect capo now no more issues just easy fun playing capo d songs again only buy the silver model because when if you get silver you are guaranteed to get aluminum not thermoplastic i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive lighter than a full boom used the s for years but thought i would give these a try fuller sound with the s buti cannot bend them like the s i have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety s for rhythm and finger style s for lead get the packs of single s and s too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set it works for what i need it arrived earlier than i expected really nice my guitar is safe now with this hard case it does a good job for it s primary purpose as a capo so i gave it four stars it works flawlessly but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn t easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood pretty darn good in every way trim and easy to use solid construction i recommend this capo without reservation i like it and it is small so based on the reviews from amazon and a friend who swears by these pickups i decided to put one into my taylor i am extremely pleased this was my brother s guitar and he had a mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop it sounded terrible i tried messing with placement to get it to sound better but it just didn t sound good had tons of feedback and just didn t have a good feel i installed this pickup myself i have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars and this one was pretty painless i didn t have to drill out the endpin hole so it only took me about minutes to install this bad boy when i tested it out i was blown away it sounded beautiful just like my taylor only louder the true test was an actual live performance i brought my baggs para acoustic d i and i was glad i did i was able to adjust the eq just a tad cut some of the mid range a bit and it sounded even better i could not believe it it literally gave me chills if you re on the fence about this pickup go for it the reviews don t lie this sounds fantastic especially if you can eq it a bit i did plug in without the padi just to test it and it still sounded good if i forgot my padi i would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system it might be labeled as passive but it s got the volume of an active system for sure it s a great buy in my opinion if you are a beatle fan this is such a cute item was more than i expected for the price nice for collectable or to use i don t have a classical guitar but i just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non radiused fingerboard i ve also got over a dozen capos don t ask but all are for radiused fingerboards the fingerboards of most steel string guitars electric and acoustic are radiused that is they are not flat they have a gentle curve to them so gentle that many wouldn t notice it unless they looked closely look up fingerboard in the wikipedia for an excellent discussion and google images for diagrams and pictures even though the curve is gentle if a fingerboard is radiused a capo must be curved too or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz if a fingerboard is flat like a classical guitar s the capo must be flat too or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz if you re not sure whether your guitar s fingerboard is radiused slide a ruler between two frets if it lies flat then so is the fingerboard if it rocks the fingerboard is radiused i really like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw this makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure not tool little which would cause strings to buzz and not too much which would cause the instrument to go out of tune as others have noted its one drawback is that it can t be clamped to the headstock when not in use but for that i d replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo highly recommended my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it it s been in heavy use hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and i don t think we ve even had to replace the batteries yet it s got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust we tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn t loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust this one is great i ve been using these strings on my guitars for the last years they always give me consistent results i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there best inexpensive right angle cables out there i use these in my lesson room at the music store that i teach at they will last forever if you take care of them the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings for steel strings i want more pressure i advise getting the ns capo that is not lite i prefer that one above this model seems like it draws current even when it s off i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar i make sure to turn this tuner off before putting the guitar away and when i get around to playing the guitar again to days later the battery is already drained this happened at least three times already the tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that i have to compare against i don t know which one is more accurate the good thing is it s very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it i probably won t buy again for my other and future guitars the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference for my style the dunlop tortex is perfect the surface is matte and not too slick i don t think i have ever worn one down to being unusable they seem to last forever or until they re lost i ve tried other brands and picks made of other materials but i always come back to these i ll probably be buried with one in my hand was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well i still use the kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered more you can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar and minimize string stress and de tuning each time you move your capo very nice product i like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing great item sturdy had it for a few weeks now small light durable holds the strings down perfectly too great capo these stands are great for my lesson business i bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight works well arrived fast no problems works as described a good purchase for a low priced capo works for acoustic and electric i purchased a classical guitar and only had a traditional steel string capo available to me not thinking it through i used it on my nylon stings and after a few times i realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced along with my string order i added this capo so it does not happen again pros it s small and lightweight it s very well made it not only looks great but also appear to be of high quality it s very adjustable unlike my steel string capo this uses a screw knob to tighten not spring loaded this allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings it works on steel strings yep i found my self needing a capo on another guitar and only having this with me i saw no reason it should not work so i gave it a try and it performed wonderfully i won t be using it full time on my steel strings but great to know in a pinch i have use it if you need a great capo thats gentle on your nylon strings then this is the one to get all adjustments keep position well about as sturdy as a tripod can be exactly as advertised no complaints from this user i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot i believe its the older metal version of this not the lite however this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner on a martin jumbo acoustic it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too i m not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one it doesn t seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw i wouldn t recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use if you are looking for the screw down style i would look for the older version of this and avoid the lite
305	a little history i have been a guitar player for forty odd some of them very odd years for the first thirty of them i tuned by ear starting by guessing at what a low e sounded like then tuning the other five strings by fretting listening and tuning i could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord yet remained off for others it took quite a long time to get it right then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out the problem i thought was that my guesses at a true e were off so i got myself an e tuning fork cycles and used it to tune the first string then i did as i had always done fretted and tuned the other five not much better as a result kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right during those years i tried tuning all six strings to what i believed was an accurately tuned piano as well as by ear to tones available online nothing gave me better tuning on the first try then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck the realization there have been many each of which has led me closer to what i have now near perfect tuning on the first go round first off i realized that when we say e that is not just one note it is a range of literally hundreds perhaps even thousands of specific tones the same is true for every note this is akin i guess to the realization as a child that no matter how many shades of blue are in a box of crayons the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare purchasing my first chromatic tuner a ct manufactured by switchmucic and sold through musiciansfriend com moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning however that tuner had at least two limitations firstly it s construction is rather light and flimsy it works ok but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the korg for about the same price that is that the korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you both tuners have plug in for electric instruments and so far as i can tell their accuracies are similar i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned additionally the korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs and remembers the original tuning tones so you can return to it for more standard usage a nice extra piece of flexibility the lcd meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you right away whether you are sharp flat and by how much or right on as a point of surprising interest the tuning fork i had used for years turns out to be profoundly flat a shock to me given that i had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones i have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be i guess the round pitch pipe that ms sweeny used to tune up the class in the th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed and finally this is a marvelous little and inexpensive device well constructed accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances i assume that there will be still higher places for my learning curve in this area to rise to but for right now this is it i am using it regularly on all my stringed instruments two six string martins a twelve string epiphone and a frailing banjo the time it saves tuning the string alone makes it more than it s own price if you have not discovered chromatic tuning maybe i really was the last one to discover these things i suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds really right perhaps people with perfect pitch can do very nicely without a chromatic tuner i am not one of them are you this has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar going to also last for a long time cause just a small amount goes a long ways i ve had two of these tuners they are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners they re durable and have a long battery life unlike most other tuners in noisy environments they don t lock in on higher pitches before lower ones again a plus for low instrument players the one problem that i ve had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to a to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as a strange this tuner is easy to use i like that it has the input jack for electric guitar as well as acoustic it makes it so much easier this is my first tuner in a long time and i m please with it
306	i bought this bench on an amazon warehouse deal so that i could get it on prime delivery and was not disappointed at all the bench is very sturdy and comfortable the cushioning is thick and soft the item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds this bench is just what i was looking for and i m sure it will serve its purpose for many years the stand seems sturdy the base is like a tripod base of a mic stand so it may hold up better in the long run than my other stands that have the clamping type of base the top of the stand is shorter than my others not really a problem but worth mentioning the only gripe i could have with the stand is that the top takes two screws and two wingnuts so it is not practical to use for gigging setting up tearing down i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated the seat is very soft and comfortable however it doesn t appear to hold anyone with excess weight what was it brillcream a dab will do ya something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning worth the coin i decided to try these because the normal picks i was using kept slipping out of my fingers that was several months ago i am still using these everyday pretty durable and reliable i do recommend these d addario is a company i ve been using since i first started playing guitar and these strings live up to their title they do have a warm bright and balanced tone and they last months for me even after playing hours a day for people who finger style on the acoustic it is very comfortable on your fingertips these strings can produce very good sound with little effort i almost always use light light medium picks with these strings and it can get to the volume i want it isn t top of the line but it gets the job done i wouldn t abuse of the chair too much though the material looks a little floosy i m a heavier fellow and some of the harder benches i ve tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions this one on the other hand is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support it folds up easily and looks to be very well made stars no complaints and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options i love this little device the colors of the display are a nice touch red on the left hand side and green on the right the color of the device the interface is great and the clip works well it s very accurate and i love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord versus being hard to read a very attractive price i bought two it would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it and it s so cheap it wouldn t matter if you lost it
307	i bought this to restore the neck of an ibanez that i had ordered used and knew needed tlc after a few coats of this stuff the neck looked played felt like it was just out of the factory it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes when i bought this i though it wouldn t be enough boy was i wrong i ll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because i can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come item is really convienient small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading i like the swivel design swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want price can t be beat either if was looking to get my amps off the flood i have w amps and a big fender dsp i am using this for my amps it works very well i recommend them to do the job for the i am not sure i would use them for a sunn v x cabinet throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials microphones cables straps tuner etc folds up easy fits great seems stable enough these strings are a little more money than the average strings but they last longer great for the dedicated guitar player nice quality fretboard oil has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way i would definitely recommend this worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard these fender foot guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buck every part of these cables are quality
308	i feel strange giving this classic only stars but it s just not for me it s large and takes up space on my pedal board i prefer the little big muff i owned this pedal for many years before finally trading it in on some other equipment it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing the sound it does very well is the late s early s fuzz sound white room black curtains satisfaction ina gadda da vida note this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound as i said it does one thing very well but its range even with classic rock is quite limited if you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound this pedal gets you of that sound if you want to also cover other classic rock you re gonna need at least one more overdrive distortion effect i cannot express how over sized this pedal is it s ridiculously big and it s unnecessary if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do again please be aware of the dimensions this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though though it does rob tone it s noisy but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume it works fine i bought it cause gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product great heavy picks amazingly cheap price you really can t go wrong i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry and this has been great to have an endless supply
309	we opted for the world tour guitar gig bag over a hard case because most of the time my son s guitar is hanging on the wall usingstring swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary this case is generally good quality and meets our needs with the following observations pros lightweight doesn t add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar good quality strong material stitching and zippers storage pockets big enough for music pages picks and a small electronic tuner handles good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapscons limited protection this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact appearance this is not awe inspiring to look at being very basic and the world tour logo looks a little cheesy this was a good choice for the limited light use it gets from us recommended cfh i bought this for my brother for a christmas gift when we got him a guitar he never used it but not because of anything to do with the actual product i was looking for a better quality mic but not willing to pay a high price to sing on the internet this was a low price and high quality solution nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box it does pick up noise around me since this is a condenser mic but that just means you pick a quiet place to record lol received item when promised fits great for my yamaha acoustic electric but carry with care remember acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped great zipped pockets this is a wonderful item that really works arrived fast having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards this makes a great gift item i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great they don t move around in my hand i have yet to drop one and for the first time i noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar these sound great i ve found a new favorite pick i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it
310	decent quality cheap price we ll see how long it lasts but for now does the trick i think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand i just needed this for my new guitar from the looks of it it complements the instrument well i am happy with it i have my string on this stand when i m taking a break from practicing as you know a case is where you should store your guitars not on a stand it is easy to assemble you ll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one if you re gigging i might suggest a higher priced stand but for occasional travel and home use this will do the trick i bought of these because of the ridiculously low price i figured i d get my money s worth from them regardless they work fine so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio the price went up nearly on them though bah after suffering through crackles lost signals and all the rest i decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through amazon com because the new acoustic electric classical i received as a gift has an end pin outlet i bought the spectraflex with the right angle connector although i have been using the cable for only a few weeks i am very impressed the connections on all the guitars and basses on which i ve used it are sure with no loss of signal no crackles perhaps most impressive is the fact that i can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal finally i can be confident that when i play something will consistently come out of the amplifier by the way the old school tweed look is a plus too these picks were a good deal they are pretty cool looking and i will be able to use them for a long time they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks i ve been using slinky s for so long now i honestly don t see me using any other brand ever again they are tough well made and simply work and sound great do what everyone else does and try them out and see for yourself what a difference a great string makes to your playing this seems like a nice product but maybe i m doing something wrong i can t get the bottom guitar support to lock in place it twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place maybe there is something i need to do differently needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer it is limited in what it can do but it does the job i m rapidly becoming a behringer fan the three points mentioned in another rating inputs should be out the back needs rubber feet and the led are spot on i d also like to see another set of outputs on it as well it could also use being a tad bigger they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together the led for the power on this thing is so bright it s obnoxious it almost blinds you other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise i ordered two of these stands and they work very well definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things
311	ordered one of these gig bags for a new les paul the hard shell cases are back ordered and i didn t want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust fits a lp studio perfectly has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket does the job i love pedal trains because they are lightweight come with a case and are easy to work with if pedaltrain asked me my opinion i would say that they needed to raise the back up about to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use but other than that its a pedaltrain nuff said i have an esp guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when i got the guitar after buying a line pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear cables etc i originally put it on my wish list because i will admit you don t always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise my guitar fits perfectly it used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut as mentioned the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close but this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag and the pockets oh the pockets they fit all of my gear i have my guitar cable a set of full size sennheiser headphones a line pocket pod all the allen wrenches a tuner and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets and there is room for more if i need it the bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn t stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won t bother anyone and it s fine after a day or two one last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock i did not know this but wow i had no idea how useful that could be i tend to carry my guitar in bag up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful then you have the backpack handles as an option as well i really cannot recommend this bag enough i do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like but i don t really care the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that and while the padding is great i would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel it would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage in case you want it for that kind of thing i don t travel long distances with my guitar but if i did i would use a hard case only for that as i have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it it has a lot of power and noise behind it it is a little starter amp just in case the picture was a little deceiving i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion with distortion it sounds great it is a solid piece of work and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp got this for an sg style guitar and it fits with plenty of room this is a better quality bag than an average bag but with a couple of comments it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip surprised me because it s a large toothed zipper construction seems to be pretty good this is not a hard case but to get a guitar from point a to b it works just fine padding is sufficiently thick it s not a paper thin bag but it s not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop would i get another one probably as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances otherwise i d get a soft sided hard case the new wave of styrofoam cases or a regular old hard sided case this is a great bag regardless of cost the fact that it sells for less than makes it an absolutely fantastic deal free shipping only makes it that much better unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed the fabric itself is a heavy cordura material the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your solid body guitar some very substantial protection i would estimate the padding which is entirely concealed within the cordura to be approximately three quarters of an inch thick in addition to the main carry handle at the side there is another in back at the top as well a pair of backpack style straps so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn t be any kind of an issue the two zippered accessory pouches for picks a spare set of strings and perhaps some music are also a nice touch in my opinion this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain as it is it s very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii this quality bag would probably cost more like at your local music store appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers not terrible but somehow chemical hope it goes away soon
312	this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff and that my friends is the problem i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo i know i know did i mention this sucker is big i feel like they should name it the pedal porch maybe i can put a few potted plants on it so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds then by all means knock yourself out just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space no joke i am a tech as well as a guitar player i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections most of us know by now that there s a lot of hype but it really comes down to good quality cable this seems to be good stable connectors these seem to be the connections between the two that last time will tell all i know is i have hand soldered special plugs with good cable to only have them break with use and i expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged unplugged often i do know these are signal clean do not bleed f highs that is critical in my book they are very easy to use can be done on stage between or before sets very quickly and with no soldering i love that i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem lm very good quality cable and plugs easy to make custom length cables from inches to ft my pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that i actually made room for more because there was no extra wire to get in the way polishes well you could probably buy a microfiber cloth from somewhere else and it would do the same thing but this one works well i can t compare it as others have done with the ocd but it simply gives me an overdrive that i love i have several other od pedals tube screamer lovepedal kalamazoo and even a cheap danelectro ds the jf is truly my favorite right now i ve been using it with a strat and a les paul clone into either a fender vibro or a small bugera v it serves up great tones into either one
313	some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit first of all i had to fumble around with it for almost minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like i got a previously returned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and i was careful not to manhandle it because i could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force i was about to give up but i felt bad to do the return because i didnt want to make amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over in postage to send back to them but eventually i figured it out i am a ft inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because i opened it all the way and there was still an inch or to spare if i wanted to raise it to the maximum looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height they probably only raised out of the segments so for the price i think you get what you pay for and since i just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home i think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under years old i recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order and then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new one the truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care such as myself but not for children or drunks it is very fragile and easy to break i took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you over tighten so be very very careful i will keep mine but if i had to purchase a second unit i would not buy this one because i dont like flimsy junk and i feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing i ve been buying dunlop pick for at least years now and i love the feel and the grip the picks last for a really long time and i would recommend getting several thickness for different applications but for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick it may be a challenge to assemble it i personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how i am wired i am not good at putting things together without help good product after you get it assembled james i am years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months as you can imagine i need to practice a lot my wife of years does not enjoy my practicing especially when i practice monotonous scales i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor s web site i love it easy to put on and take off the rubber won t hurt your violin bridge or strings you can barely hear it in the next room you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge my violin s tone doesn t change much at all with this mute now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me this stand is a little difficult to open the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it
314	they sound pretty good they tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments i have been using hercos for for many years they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification i place a herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits for guitars i place a herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness these stay connected but aren t so wide that they change the style of picking i like them and so does my music teacher we try to stay stocked in these picks stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity a must have for us dry californians it doesn t seem to work i think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn t seem to absorb any water i was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that i need a humidifier for my guitar at first i was not sure what i was looking for i found the product without too much difficulty i had learned from my instructor that these are small placed on the hole of the guitar and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition i started looking through the computer pages and settled on the herco guitar humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product now i feel i made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations and good music these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well as other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it s not abused i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects i have found that the delay works well around percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay i don t know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves it s purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some eq tinkering i found a good mix of echo i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d and thought it would be a good idea again danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings but it was a bit of a pain you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar this is much easier and the guitar sounds great highly recommended
315	yes this pedal is plastic the switch is not the most durable feeling and the knob placement is annoying at less than you need to be able to look past these things i ve had a higher failure rate with the dunlop cry baby and that thing is built like a cinder block this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended which is to say this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going no overdrive pedal lives up to it s potential running into a solid state even modeling amplifier it s just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy some have complained about rf interference with the use of the fab pedals getting radio signals through your amp i have had that happen with pedals costing x the price of the fab particularly when running a long pedal chain based on tone alone this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under check out the youtube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by intheblues i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great if you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of you may be surprised particularly if your other gear amp and guitar are halfway decent what i did note though was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other ts type pedals that doesn t make it worse or better just different the mid hump is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer which is a good thing imho there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes since it isn t true bypass you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review i ve been playing guitar since and have used vintage dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced i am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear ymmv this pedal works but doesn t have the depth of echo i expected i doesn t even come close to the same sound quality of my old dan echo de pedal that certainly explains the difference in price you get what you pay for i m using it with a fender eighty five solid state amp i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same if you re looking for a good slap echo effect i would recommend spending more money and buy the dan echo de pedal or even the danelectro blt slap echo pedal is less expensive than the dan echo but still sounds better than the fab echo pedal the fab echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it it s just not as good as i expected i m sorry i bought it and i don t recommend this pedal there are much better ones on the market shop around i bought this pedal after looking at the boss tu and korg pitch black for bass this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode strumming all or strings works well for a quick tune but i still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune the accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low b i read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out tc electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped imo but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselves i was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the ad g strings and it worked okay the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze i chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as i can i tested this sweep option on an old ibanez artcore guitar which hasn t been played for years and even with old strings i got a reasonable tune out of it strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune i am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old boss tu i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze how many times did i tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided i didn t need chorus at all this pedal is not like that not much to tweak but the chorus is great sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords i even like it with the bass just a great chorus with not much to tweak the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great wow this thing is fun to play with this is my first delay pedal so i cant compare it with others but im so happy that i bought it ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day you can tweak the echo in s of different ways the case seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last quite a while as long as i dont get over zelous and stomp on it too hard im very happy with this product and im becoming a real fan of behringer products i m sure this isn t the best echo pedal or even in the top but it serves it s purpose fairly well stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn t something that most of us can t live with for us it s worth taking the risk imhoupdate the pedal gave up the ghost died in a relatively short amount of time i replaced it with mini modtone type delay i actually like the dano sound better but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better is the the best pedal ever not even close does it do exactly what you want a simple slap back echo reverb to do absolutely i almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound it can give you a decently wet surf ish sound or a fast delay rockabilly sound it s not super versatile but if you re looking for a little depth and color for under then this is what you need i mean come on it works it s cheap and it doesn t take up much room on your pedal board it has a s slap back echo its good for the price no putting it down for sounding bad as with most danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits if you want something that is just reverb without all the slap back then behringer dr which i use for vocal for guitar i use rv which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer good price for effect if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you i have amps that have this feature that due a better job
316	this thing sounds great with my tube amps both with my watt danelectro amp from with it s inch speaker and my watt excelsior from fender it has a good range of overdrive levels it is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lo fi stuff like the black keys the white stripes and garage band like stuff it is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz i love mine for the price and its a good mix up compared to my modded sd and my overdriven tube amps it s different and just worth having to mess around with just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last also the blue led is very bright thats either an annoyance or great rock on it s plastic that s star deduction but in this case very pleased overall the effect here isn t to take off to another planet of sound but all set at middle o clock this pedal is awesome and really appealing several other combinations are excellent too check youtube there s plenty on this great price pedal the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
317	i m a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished i want them to be slick when i bend notes if you polish too hard or too often with steel wool it can wear down your frets these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them i think amazon had the best price this is a very good strap lock system i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap recommended the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard what i like most is that the padded arm is thin and keeps out of the way of your playing highly recommended the sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn t going to last long also trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing i m going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it first things first this is a fuzz pedal and on the heavy side which mean it provides thick ground shaking distortion and sustain this is very different from normal distortion so noise is to be expected whether you are playing or not second a true bypass switch like in the big muff is a mechanical switch as opposed to boss type pedals that have buffers which color your sound even when they are off mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing this pedal has a tone of versatility because not only do you have a lot of options on the pedal itself but it reacts dynamically to the knobs on your guitar since i play a les paul with classics i will often turn the volume down to when using this otherwise the bass can be overwhelming but awesome strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils in addition the wicker and tone features all for more sounds that just the original big muff or you can just turn them off to get the original sound great for black keys they use a big muff weezer think my name is jonas certain greenday songs and basically anything where you need thick and deep fuzz with the option to tone it down if need be
318	pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway good price solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag there isn t really much in the way of instructions but the leds are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out if you d ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast don t go onto the stage without one on these boxes we bought this stand for our son s new guitar amp mic and it works fine for his set up it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly this cable seems like it will last me for a while as it is only being used to connect a di box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do works as advertised great at eliminating feedback in a live setting also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars these strings were designed for the new rosewood series guitars that came out this year the promise is a bolder high end fuller low end i am a long time taylor owner and favor their series rosewood spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs i recently picked up an ce first edition fret such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hd s took some getting used to as far as feel due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings e b g but as far as sound they are great the d a low e strings are no different from the regular elixir pb lights so i am not sure about the claim of fuller low end compared to what unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response i am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than taylor s but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings that is what i notice most from the hd s compared to the regular i still find no fault with the regular elixir nanaweb pb s but will most likely continue to run the hd s on my fret i may also try them on my older ce just to see if there is any difference improvement so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain try them out and make your own decision idiot proof compact extremely sturdy all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts runs on aa batteries features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperpyle pro pct are test tone function which sends a known volume signal down the line very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment intermittent issue indication this is what made me choose this model if there s even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot my only complaints the a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife quite frustrating used my dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw and managed to get it out there s an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous luckily i have no need for the clip i used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw no rubber feet on the bottom metal enclosure battery cover screw sliding around and marring whatever it sits on i stuck some re purposed rubber feet on the bottom after the few problem solving situations mentioned above this thing is a star product too bad they couldn t go the extra step to make it star out of the box
319	for the price it s worth it i guess if you just want to try it go for it that s what i got it for it sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals i would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal but for the price it s not too bad oh and the casing isn t like a wimpy plastic knife plastic it s pretty durable albeit don t throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps well like everyone knows this is the copy of the boss but a lot cheaper than that it works just fine and i m happy with it anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal if you want more from a pedal the boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance the chorus is subtle but it seems lacking to me it is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have it is a fender product so it is well made reasonably priced it will make any strat or tele build shine fast delivery works perfectly i have of the danelectro effects pedals hard to say which i prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound i m partial to the chorus good item honest for cost it s star but i got and handle was slightly mismolded rubber groove is a little off but in no way matters just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel this is a nice heavy cordura like military spec heavy with self repairing zippers standard kind and totally adequate pad soft nylon lined and bonus pockets nice build pvc piping on pocket edges adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight heavy rubber feet for standing it up give a of wet ground protection if needed for the price of many other brands i got and for what most folks expect they are great how many times did i tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided i didn t need chorus at all this pedal is not like that not much to tweak but the chorus is great sweetens my cleans makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords i even like it with the bass just a great chorus with not much to tweak the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d ms delay effects pedal works great and gives me as much delay as i need there s no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the delay you want with no effort at all this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great i have a home brew pedal board with pedals on it this allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems the blue led lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions not a bad price either the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out i ve owned two of these pedals and they both had the same quirk the delay is amazing the repeats trail and decay beautifully the controls give you a wide range of tones but they ve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me one constant high pitched screeching tone my signal chain was low gain and its done it when it was the only pedal in the chain so it s not another pedals influence i love the sound but i won t use it live in case of feedback that being said its still a very good pedal i have yet to find a pedal that can match this little guys desired effect if you know how to use it it really delivers a good effect its sound pretty good i mean the range rate arent as broad as others i ve tried but i stomp on it regularly it cuts my signal a bit so i compensate an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up all in all worth it
320	my son needed a capo expensive at music shop where he takes lessons at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price guardian well it is padded but i ve only gigged once since having the item with rehearsals held prior and i can say that the case is nicked up pretty good as they say in the south yes it will last because it is a guitar case but there s no way there s enough security to protect an instrument on a plane now that s for flight cases to handle but don t even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the guardian fails to guard against crushing your hardware this item is not one of the better cases out there but it does suffice and it does look good the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great say that now though after using it outside the house times and you d be a lying sob this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china i bought it to replace the original chipboard case for a gibson es archtop lower bout is wide upper bout is wide body is long and it s about deep at the bridge fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for the case is about longer than the top of the headstock but i didn t expect an exact fit the wood shell is thin so don t drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases normal plush fake fur inside with about of soft foam all around black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay this is not a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use only annoying thing the case arrived locked the keys were of course inside the case dumb a friend at a music store used a key from another guardian case to unlock it a good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and not to keep crooks out a good modeling amp my only complaint is i didn t like the clean sounds not to my liking other than that an awesome amp one of my fav toys
321	good quality strong and excellent finish nicely priced a foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing a must for classical players great all round pick one of my favorites easy to grip and are pretty quite they wear out extremely fast though i seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i ve been playing guitar for like years these picks are the bomb they don t break on you when you strum too hard fast d i would rate this product stars if i could i m completely satisfied with these picks tip these picks are great for high action high gain guitar solo s i ve been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately and this is my favorite purchase as of late i ve bought nice straps but when i m practicing for hours at a time this foot rest is a great reprieve and literally a weight off my shoulders i have of these stands for my guitars i have classical guitars flamenco guitars and acoustic steel string it s very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over it s a really great quality stand for the price they don t take up a lot of room and they re very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you re traveling i highly recommend it my guitar teacher suggested that i keep my guitar s out because he said that if i kept it them in a visible easily accesible place that i would practice more even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags cases after each practice session i have them all out and displayed and i definitely practice and play more because as soon as i step into the room there they are i just pick any one of them up and start playing it was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but i hadn t realized that i always had the excuse that i didn t have time to practice but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn t take up a lot of time for some reason kept me from practicing i guess out of sight out of mind but now i keep my guitars out and i also bought a music stand and i keep the music i m working on and the stand out yes it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful just what i needed the display is easy to read and easier to use my old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy a definate must for any guitar player simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors haven t used it a great deal but it seems to be great and non damaging to the finish on the guitar the handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo but this is a good choice at a great price this little foot stool is really sturdy it stays in place beautifully no rocking sideways no wobbly action if one of the notches doesn t do it for you you re screwed there s no gradual adjustment but the positions it allows make sense for of players excellent mother s little helper highly recommend this item it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument a must this thing is useless good idea but way too light rickety to be useful unless you re constantly aware of it of the time you ll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it pass on this the mounting process was simple recommendation buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don t already have one you don t want your instrument plummeting to the floor i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers they re holding up very well the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall whether that s a good thing is up to you i guess i don t have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped so maybe it is a good thing be careful when you hang it though it could definitely hit the wall if you don t place it on the hanger carefully i ve owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one this one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value i m and weigh there are numerous adjustment angles that i can switch to and be comfortable and i m not concerned about the legs bending the photo makes them look weaker than they are
322	it s great to have a few extra mic clips on hand and for the price these are great they hold sm perfectly not cheap or poorly made at all a great value well what can i say it takes a signal and splits it ways offering output at hp level genius i bought it for my church since we re going the hp monitoring route and this was my best bet against the super over priced shure senheiser audio technica overpriced systems i paired this up with the ma and it works great hook up an xlr straight from the di and voila you got both inputs with separate control like i said genius i have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar this little device gives me auto correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren t overbearing and the pitch correction sounds really natural now i just need more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound i use my shure sm b mainly for podcasting and voice work and it performs extremely well in those applications i also use aheil pr dynamic studio recording microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm natural feel one thing well actually two things the shure sm b has that the heil pr does not is a set of two switches one for bass rolloff and one for mid range emphasis presence boost while both of these switches can be useful i prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing eq handle adjustments that need to be done if you don t have outboard processing both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises for example someone bumping the table to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better when i reviewed the heil pr i said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the shure sm b may be changing my mind a bit while the pr is about cheaper than the sm b here on amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most pr users will want to use a shockmount about and pop filter windscreen to get the best results out of the microphone with the sm b the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and shure includes two different foam windscreens one for normal use and one for ultra close up use with the microphone so the bottom line is the shure sm b with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the heil another thing worth mentioning is that like the heil pr the shure sm b is built like a tank it is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications the sm b takes a little more to drive it than the heil pr so you ll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer pre amp that can handle the microphone the bottom line is the shure sm b is a very high quality microphone and i would highly recommend it if you re comparing it to the heil pr most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very very close this will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too the rhythm machine has rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo it is not perfect as it has no on off switch it reverts to default mode when you power it up it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats it only cost around so perfection should not be expected for practice and the home studio it is great i ve used this mic with my tascam us audio interface and pc to record a high school chorus concert and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone i placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone and one as a piano instrument microphone and have gotten great results from both the reproduction of the sound was very good the mic seems very solid in build and able to possibly take a little abuse which is good with a travelling recording system but i definately wouldn t try dropping one even though they re a nice metal case and metal grill i d recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals and instrumentals on a budget i have yet to try these with micing guitar amps but that s my next step as well as drums i ve had it for about a month now and it hasn t fallen apart so i guess that s a plus but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore useless thanks to this problem i am only able to use two slots out of twelve it s definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this for me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great value it s the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages however it s the attention to small construction details that i love the xlr ends are quality components but cheap ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly another factor is the strain reliefs at each end those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them of course the color coding is a godsend i can now tell at a glance what is connected to what both live and in my home studio i have not experienced any extraneous noise using these but i am careful to eliminate sources or route around them still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased i ll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision i was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk not the case i can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear this stand is very stable and useful so if you want a cheap way to rack your stuff this is the way to go
323	my daughter is learning how to play and the string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain i put a set of the d addario nyxy strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up usually i ve had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch but the d addario s seemed to do a much better job i nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly the wound strings also seem quite stable frequently it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in but i ve seen no such issues with the d addario s i usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone but i was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than i usually like my daughter is also very happy with them since they re not quite so tough on her fingers unfortunately the first one of these i ordered from amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place take two the second set i received was in great condition and i m really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course to keep your guitar looking and sounding great good product but i d expected more robust on your structure but it s good product don t have adhesive to bind on the surface i noticed an immediate improvement in my playing as this tuner above all others i have tried korg intellitune etc brings your instrument into dead on ringing true tune across the instrument i use this on my fender stratocaster gibson les paul custom fender telecaster fender stratacoustic and takaminie classical works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars with all of the features capo tune visual metronome acoustic as well as vibration tuning plus calibration this is one tuner you won t want to be without and the only one you need wow this is the pedal to own there are a lot of good pedals out there but this one has that original bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from s quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps just amazing if you don t have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine a great purchase and built like a tank this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
324	i ve never been much of an effect pedal guy lots of batteries and cables when i can just get a good tone direct into my fender tweed i ve recently conceded to using more effects and have gone quite frankly hog wild on new gear this is the best of the pedal purchases i have made so far it s not quite the mxr sound i was going for but there s definitely something here the boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my strat just two controls one for volume one for compression my only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy i haven t pulled them off yet but i would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones this is better than a gig bag for sure and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric now it s not padded really well and doesn t look like it ll hold up for more than a few years but it was cheap it seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly which is why i drop a star good little instrument to pass the time with while setting on a porch or at a campfire with friends buy this after reading all the great reviews i moved to these light medium strings from the light gauge they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge however i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy finger slides are much harder with these strings the lower strings e a g just don t slide as easily until there is some buildup in them as a result my fingers get out of position and don t hit clear notes until i ve slid those areas a couple of times that s probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them the packaging was also a bit confusing since there are two strings to an envelope it seems i too easily get the strings reversed on set up other string makers i have tried color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up overall good strings and i ll probably buy them again not much to say here they re knobs they look good are well made and fit perfectly on the cts pots in my guitar
325	these d addario medium acoustic guitar strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point the strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our auto tuner and have held up well highly recommendedcfh it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power the portable feature is great also just what i wanted it s really not a w system the booklet even says it is only watts and i doubt it is really even that powerful the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar but it s not watts loud i guess it s ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals
326	this is a wonderful product for the price ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain a little difficult to set up properly but if you are running an eq separate then you only have to adjust the input and output i dont care much for the tube display with led lights behind it but it doesn t bother me either behringer makes great products at incomparable prices i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception microphone there are ins and outs balanced unbalanced on each channel i am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position i run this direct to my digital recorder i get a good clean sound on my vocals still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit the unit is channels has rack mounts and is sturdy not sure on the tube yet new to the behringer product line but so far i like it and will explore its potential stars for price quality features amazon i like this preamp i use one channel for microphone and the other for an electric guitar with good results is very sadly and spendthrift that its useful life will be the duration of its tube another concept of producci oacute n nothing considered with consumer and planet but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with use a plugin instead i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed this particular unit is not one of their finest products but i give them credit for the price point and effort someone will appreciate it but not me it sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as it s not defective but just not up to what i want cheap so no big loss i had some band mates that did not seem to respect my shure sm mics very well so i bought some of these cheap mics to use on them i was very surprised to find that i like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable sm and these behringer mic s are about the price each no problem with feedback or handling noiseno problem with electronic induced noisesounds gooddirt cheaphandy carrying casewhat s not to like
327	this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home it s a great little unit the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones i tested in my friend recording studio and work really good trust me for the price it over the top works great and doesn t cost an arm and a leg quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence great price too i have two of these for my acoustics and when i get another acoustic i ll be buying another one of these nice quick release without having to tie anything i have one that is over years old and still works like a charm i m a bassist and am familiar with the flat round half round debate on basses i prefer flats anyway my son wanted these for his epiphone casino because he heard john lennon used a different brand of flat wounds they sound amazing they make that casino ring like a carillon yet will get down dirty when called for a very different sound range than round wounds in fact it s about time to order another set or three for the money this mic performs very well it is very sensitive i can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic if you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room i also put a pop filter on it i ve only had it a day so i ll see how it does in the long run got this tuner for my new bass clipped it onto the headstock was able to tune without plugging it into the amp clear bright display might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars not much to say other than it s a good cable good solid connections with no play after consistent use it s going strong i left my trusty manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when i came upon this alternative offered by amazon as banged up as a manhasset can get from week end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home i ve never had one fail on me over the past years there s nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension preventing pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward but the rub is their non adaptability the feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music consequently these ubiquitous well proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan especially with a couple of keyboards amps instrument stands and other requisite gear on board this is where amazon s on stage music stand becomes attractive of course it doesn t hurt that it costs less than a manhasset it permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music consequently it s much easier to find a convenient place whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat for packing the stand simply slide it into position the drawback apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about be careful not to over tighten those set screws is that this thing is heavy frankly i was expecting a lightweight stand at least compared to my old manhasset but if you ve owned or been around the latter the first thing you re likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable substantial addition in weight at the same time with the moving parts and the set screws topped by plastic rotating serrated wheels the on stage stand doesn t give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the manhasset in other words i m very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear pile after a long exhausting hour gig bottom line the on stage appears to be a good value a truly heavy duty stand in most respects that ll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs but don t expect it to lighten your load or simply because it s heavier to last longer than a manhasset if you do a lot of traveling and don t plan to put one of those page piano folders on the stand there s at least one truly lightweight albeit plastic stand that s worked out really well for me perhaps needless to say some haven t they fall apart or they re so ingeniously designed that it takes minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving pint sized cases but the peak stand is made to hold up in turn it holds up relatively heavy music books and has served me well for several years just as i was about to condemn the stand i called the company they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped and the peak stand has been problem free ever since it ll cost you a bit more but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds
328	do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit that said for the price it is an excellent product obviously if you are looking for a studio quality mic you would not be here this product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations for a normal use this is quite good feels little tiny but excellent gain i would buy it again if required i bought a few of these to hook ipods iphones to live stage sound systems most of which are not in stereo anyway so why use stereo to mono adapters or separate channels when it s not needed perfect solution seems durable on my mixer i have send returns on the same plug using a wire trs with send on the tip return on the ring and a common ground but my effects boxes like to have separate tr ins and outs this is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkbehringer shark fbq automatic feedback destroyerto the vlz s send returnsmackie vlz ch compact recording sr mixeri probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send return these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work i m using them in our drum room one is on hi hat and one is on a small cymbal they have a smooth un hyped sound the mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box i have used them in an x y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of each so i am aware of what expensive microphones sound like these perform up there with the expensive mice while being bargain priced good music to all
329	put my schecter c custom fr in drop bb these strings sound great and have a great low end highly reccomend it is lighter than most fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy speakers the material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging times a week i only needed one i haven t use it but i m sure it s going to work well this is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on top ffsalsa it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power the portable feature is great also just what i wanted these are as described these work with fender switches which turns out they include those screws and fender pickups used them while building a few pre wired pick guards i already had this pedal but needed to add a little delay to two separate channels stereo i liked this delay so much that rather than buy a stereo delay i bought another mxr carbon copy
330	this plug works very well i like the right angle connectors i have a korg pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals it included a multi plug cable but not a right angle one the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard this works much better much better than the more economical one s sold i should have gotten the foot but you live and learn my studio is small but it needs to wrap around my desk and go into my sound proof closet it matches my awesome at microphone it is always a delight nowadays when any electronic device is still functional after such a long time from when i bought it till when i write this still going strong very happy with my purchase alas my experience says newer devices being sold are rarely as good as when they first come out but you never know it may still be as good as ever now for what it s worth i am a professional musician with perfect pitch i bought one of each soft medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right the hard is as soft as the soft they felt exactly the same in fact the medium was the hardest out of the bunch packaging error i have no idea the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing so check with what you get sound wise the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar making it sound really dull and muted there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead love it nice mic to record acoustical instruments more words word word word word word word word word word word what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it don t get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to e flat much easier than on a non chromatic tuner but that s all i use it for i prefer my older tuners that light up this screen is really dim and there s not a back light my guitar room isn t super bright and it s very difficult to read guess that s why the price is so cheap although it is touted for acoustic guitars it works well with my ibanez electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic electric the spring is tough and it holds securely on and off is a quick process if you have the hand finger strength to operate it i rate it stars only because i just received it and haven t had a chance to use it much but i like it so far it was delivered quickly it does the job i ll update after i ve had it for awhile my only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see this the second set of strap locks that i ve owned they are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side the quick release and secure connection are great this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn t really work as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input
331	i ve been very disappointed with this tuner when i ve used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right sharp then back to the left flat i have two other tuners i bought from wal mart and i always get accurate tunings from them i bought this korg because it s a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation even though my tow wal mart tuners are older they both still work better than this korg i use it to clean smudges off of my guitars and to keep the fretboards clean after use it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces it is extremely well made and i have thrown it in the washer dryer and it comes out clean and new looking i keep it in my guitar case and use it often my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job the quality seems to be good and installation went fine for those of you who are unsure about drilling a hole into the guitar i would only recommend drilling into cheaper guitars unless you know what your doing of course i m using this in v in a watt tube amp it s really nice i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube the other good thing is it comes in a box from jj unlike some tubes from other places i ve ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them i was looking for a better quality mic but not willing to pay a high price to sing on the internet this was a low price and high quality solution nothing to load and i was singing right out of the box it does pick up noise around me since this is a condenser mic but that just means you pick a quiet place to record lol nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar very easy there are better tuners out there far better this could be good but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there and they don t even tune it well to standard especially when tuning the g string i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open tunings on an acoustic this piece of junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using f or c notes i have no clue as to why that is pretty stupid if you ask me especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d bags i say that with love that play in open tunings trust me your money is best spent elsewhere i ll be honest the reason i got these strings is because of the cheap price i m a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only these seem fine to me good tone and they stay in tune these are perfect but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed i would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package i have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don t match they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced had to return the first one second is holding it s own just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic spot on when used correctly inline with cables all tuners like this are going to be a little jumpy none of them are perfect this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it the korg pitchblack was a little out of my price range so the ga is working perfect for now overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand five stars i am self taught guitar for about months without this i would be lost i work with a guy who has played guitar for years he tunes it to itself when i had him try my tuner he found that his guitar was tuned to itself yet so far off for you cant beat this don t be so cheap buy this and enjoy it
332	i can t compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder i use i have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar i own and every student i ve ever had has one on their guitar as well they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding they stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time they can be easily removed and relocated after relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location i have had as many as picks stored in one and as few as one pick stored in others no matter how many picks you store or for how long the spring action loader never loses its resistance i highly recommend these i personally will never even try any others as i am so pleased with this product if you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks this is the product for you works well with every pedal i tried so far can t ask much more than that from it it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon go for it if you need one or perfect thickness and action what else can i say you won t be sorry you got these they are all i ll get from now on i own three of these units one red and two grey and use them to output midi sounds from my laptops internal sound moduals to a pro pa system mostly mackie gear for live performance and occasionally to add sounds to recordings in my track home studio this unit is quiet and very handy the price is dead cheap i have two other similar units a lexicon alpha and the smaller lexicon omega boxes that cost much more yes my lexicon boxes provide a lot of different inputs and outputs and are very nice but if all you need is a very portable basic input output sound card that is very quiet and easy to install just plug it you should buy this box some of the reviews talk about it being cheap plastic yes it is plastic so are many other more expensive units but i have been throwing these boxes in with my other equipment and have yet to break one of them or have any problems i will also admit that while i don t abuse my equipment on purpose i am not that gentle either and have dropped these several times with no damage the software that comes with the package is good but in my case i really didn t need it i have sonor cakewalk software and abobe audition but i would like to take a moment and say something about the included audacity one reviewer wrote that it is a very low low low quality software that couldn t be further from the truth i have used this software for years in my studio and it is very high quality software it can work in both and bit processing and input and output almost every type of audio format wav mp etc it also has a ton of very nice free downloads compressors eq s sonic enhancers etc from the audacity web site audacity started life as a shareware but was purchased by sound forge who was in turn bought by sony this is high quality studio software that you can still download and use for free and it s not a trial software that will expire in days or block out important features i would add that to really make it work well you need to use the preferences section to set it up to the higher quality settings that are available as i remember the defaults are set at mid level quality so the average home user can use it without taxing their computer resources the bottom line is that both behringer units and both work great and i can t hear or see any difference in them other than the color and the added software included with the package for such a low price you can t go wrong i have multiple guitars for different styles i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads good tone good sustain and they stay in tune i play gigs a week on average and practice everyday these strings get a workout and i change strings when i start to lose sustain that s why i buy the packs so i always have spare sets on hand this pedal works like a charm stays in place and works as de scribed i would buy this again if i needed to replace it these are such comfortable picks i love the texture on them which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks textures this is subtle yet effective my favorite pick now
333	good stuff i used to think a pick was a pick with the only difference being stiffness i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness the only problems i had with regular picks was them slipping in my hand turning around out of my hand on the floor and of course breaking i decided to give the dava picks a try i bought a pack of the jazz picks and a pack of these grip tips i really thought i d like the jazz picks better that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick but after trying them both i find these the grip trips are now my pick of choice they fit my grip perfectly stay put in my hand and give me maximum control when i play whether it s lead or rhythm i have yet to break one i m mainly buying another set because i ve given a few away for people to try and i want to have plenty readily available i like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations so whenever i pick up a guitar to play i ve got one close by also always keep a spare in my wallet bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops sure i can still use a regular pick when that s all that s available but why not use the best when i can update been using these picks for a year since my first review still love them still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer the only reason i need to buy more i lose them i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks but for me they are still tops which is why i m buying another half dozen jim dunlop has produced these for more years than i d like to admit to personal knowledge as long as i can remember i ve had one in my case and one on the workbench there are dozens of wannabe models but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol jim dunlop s i gotta remember not to get the black ones though i seem to lose them to easily or maybe they are really that good and they just get borrowed these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips they are very light to play and make my practising easier whille iconcentrate on building callouses
334	even though i ordered large still not fitting will do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fit i do not have giant hands so large should fit but not this very well made heavy if thats what your looking for arrived on time but good luck good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly mostly for electrics i prefer the lighter sound of the acoustic but these work very well with my friends electric fender elixir s nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings are the best strings i ve ever used on my alvarez acoustic a guitar i ve now owned for over years they certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there they have a nice punchy tone and are easy on the fingers unlike the elixir extra lights that i found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short scale guitar these seem like an ideal combination i may buy another set soon and restring the short scale instrument with lights compared with some brands and gauges of more old school strings there may be a little less bass response but these sound good pretty even through the set and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low e string this is my first guitar tuner i don t have expiriance to determine do this tuner is better then other tuners is working very good satisfaction
335	got them today and put them on a wasburn x series nice sound i would recommend these to anyone an inexpensive but nice set i ordered them because they are carbon fiber but love them because i don t loose picks anymore i used to lose a pick every other day bought six still have six a week later here s how i keep it about midway over the fretboard slide it between the e b and g strings the three smallest strings and slide it up towards the headstock it has little gecko like protrusions that grip the e string stays in place and cannot slip out wonderful i bought this for an accousic guitar then i had to have one for a mandolin and now i also have one for a square neck dobro some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don t leave much room for a leather strap some case manufacturers have the same problem this item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap the dobro had the issue with the strap didn t have a great connector i was a little unsure when i was unpacking this stand as the actual rack swings side to side when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly this cradles my guitar nicely i just wish that it was like the one in the picture and was straight it actually reclines back fairly far well father than it looks like it would in the pics i will recommend this to anybody in my life who ends up needing a guitar rack in the future d addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as i can remember this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars
336	good quality strong and excellent finish nicely priced a foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing a must for classical players arrived on time packaged well happy with purchase they are your regular picks will order again if needed happy with purchase hope you enjoy em i have been using d adario strings for years they sound great they stay in tune excellent sustain i can get better string control compared to other strings i have never experienced a string break in years scratch free durable machine washable i use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much much longer you place the cloth next to a string then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces sides and top of the string then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times then repeat on the remaining strings i then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys takes a matter of moments and works great then once every week or two it just goes in with the laundry comes out perfectly clean again polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric it is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface but it works well for polishing if i m using carnuba wax i use a cotton towel to remove it but for dry polishing wouldn t be without one for each guitar my review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones i bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars the cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage one complaint i have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my spector bass securely but works with the others flawlessly i use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues i also use spectraflex fatso flex cables and mogami and think that this one is worth it s price to me the warranty is worth it because of the price i reead all over the web about the opinions of monster s patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality but there are more expensive cables out there made by mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion
337	a nice little untreated cloth to clean my taylor guitar now if i could only play the guitar as well as this cloth cleans it i have always loved hercules products their mic stands and guitar stands they are great quality and very handy especially this one for performances where guitars are used i ve been eyeing these stands for a while always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright i d spent a little money usually here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base now that i finally have one of these i m throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these hercules stands it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar the angle this leans back makes it very stable and when a guitar is hanging on it the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over it holds both electric and acoustics i haven t done any full drop tests but regardless of which guitar i put on it the stand didn t once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitar piece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars and this stand lives up to expectations and does exactly what it s meant to do i ve been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome they cost no more than the strings i normally get but the tone and feel is totally different i can t comment on how long they ll last or keep in tune but for now i m impressed i ll probably keep using these on my santana prs for awhile since i like the sound every once in awhile i ll step outside of my box i mean i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them i use d addario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics except for my strat i like fender bullets on it so the sample from the vine sorta of nudged me and i m the better for it i use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed i also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it breaks down to a reasonable size for transport my only complaint is that it doesn t fold up smaller but otherwise this is an excellent stand i have to concede i m a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myk m memphis pro guitar stand however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build the extra heft of the hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand the k m tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor despite not folding up quite as small the hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust one action for legs one action for height whereas the k m has three separate legs and two vertical sections clamps i do realize that i bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the k m length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the k m large enough that i won t try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as i do the k m i m also not convinced hercules trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand the back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it s knock the whole stand over no big deal just more parts and weight i think i prefer k m s yoke as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks i ve had two of the k m s and the second was a bit of a disaster it was defective in more than two areas defects happen but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit and lead me to try the hercules i won t go into all of that here see my review on that product aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke the hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness i m glad i purchased this one and i think i ll get plenty of use from it but i should mention it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the k m mainly its awesome portability despite its slightly more fragile nature in the interest of further comparison i ve got anultimate gs support genesis guitar standon order and will review it against this and the k m as well i opted for the gs without an automatic closing mechanism over the gs which has one for the reasons i stated above i don t believe it is strictly necessary the reviews of the gs are also more favorable and the gs is cheaper which suits my cheapness i ve been using these strings on my guitars for the last years they always give me consistent results i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there i read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price i usually use dr tite fits but these made me change for good they have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with p s i also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar i built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint i put this on my fender jazz bass after i bought a new neck for it this plate work the exact same as the stock plate but it dresses the bass up a bit this is not a mod that people will see like pickup covers but i like the way it looks when i pick it up to play for the price this inch canvas bag is great bag for toting around a couple of folded foot light stands and miscellaneousbooms etc i own other gator products and have been very pleased with the quality and performance note that this bag does not have padding and does not have a divider but for the price paid i still think it s an excellent bargain
338	i love these cables i ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs they are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day i bought a cheap rogue a mandolin and after setting it up i of course replaced the cheap factory strings i put these on and what a difference these aren t too heavy not too light they ring nicely i find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner like dunlop ultraglide can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings the j s are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments they are bright and brassy when new and give a decent punch to the sound however because they are bronze they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier also since they are round wound they are harder to fret than a flat wound string and harder to shift up and down but the people who like them change them often like once in days or so or whenever they play a gig to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new this is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume being less elastic and less lively one thing is sure that the j s are loud and zingy and that s why dealers put them on their mandolins some folks move to the heavier j s to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops the j s are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you re in ensemble work just make sure to change them often to get the best performance this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting during winter when a guitar or mandolin moves with changes in humidity staying in tune is an issue even for expensive instruments this little device helps the player deal with the problem without constant recourse to a larger tuner not much to say it s a pic holder that attaches to a music mic stand and holds pics as advertised it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my music mic stands and it does in fact snuggly and easily hold pics well worth the small cost serves its purpose worked better when i added a quick disconnect attachment quality finish comfortable and enough range to adjust as needed i ve never bought strings before so it is kind of hard for me to rate these so far so good the strings are slightly smaller than the j and deliver a great sound several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try thanks again
339	i am learning to play the guitar i needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound i debated between this one and the other popular slightly more expensive one i cannot speak to that one s assembly process but i found this one to be reasonably simple i also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raise lower it the same goes for tilting it is a superb stand with ample table space for book ipad capo some picks and if you are creative headphones i love it and i am using it almost every single day very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered as of today this is the one that wins in the height shelf and space categories i think i have or of these work very well and looks neater than the shoe string many people use highly recommend get a few just in case but i am still on my first i do switch straps so i guess i have in use makes it very easy to put guitar on and or change out straps picks are picks right select your material select your weight and you re done right no these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them they grip your fingers it s uncanny they do not slip i wouldn t touch anything but fender mediums for years and years tried these on a whim not i have piles and piles of picks going unused these are that good what a nice clear sound it has and smooth nice size for someone with small hands i got this because of all the good things people wrote about it in the reviews sense i always wanted to play so decided to learn and wasn t shore what kind to get so thanks for all the reviews to help me out and i am so glad i got this one it came in a nice plastic case not a cardboard box all throw i did order a case for it witch i will use when i bought this harmonica not shore what harmonica to get on a low budget this is the one you won t regret it i been around blue s a long time so heard many harmonica s this one truly sounds good
340	these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used my main complaint is the very small size i haven t got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick i find the dava master control more to my liking for most things but i still use the jazz iii s from time to time when i just want a simple clean pick tone so if you want to play just in your garage this is really good for the price i like it it s ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion if you like warm sounds you should see something else i lost my trusty slide and really miss it the dunlop feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but it does sound sweet if it was just a bit smaller diameter that would do the trick my old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so a brand new sleek fit isn t a plus in my case the dunlop is well made as expected it s just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind hmmm might be a new product idea rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name i like these pics i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin good for fast strumming etc they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto i would buy them again i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced i use it with my stringer in open g tuning would buy other products from this company this is not just a tuner its a peacekeeper for our band arguing over tuning can really take up time it works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached i do kind of miss the fights over who s in tune and who s flat though excellent product though the metronome is of no value but that s not important we use it for guitars violins violas cello bass guitar voice training and ordering pizza who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill great sounding slider for my electric and it won t shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action it has a great sound for the modern electric guitars but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances i recommend
341	i love these picks especially in this gauge they are a bit thinner than the jazz s so if you master em you can in theory play faster they have a good grip and a nice texture the tone it gives isn t bad either i ve been playing guitar for about years and within the last year bought my first taylor guitar taylor guitars ce ltd grand auditorium acoustic electric guitar it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory i am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce what s even better is how long they last i m pretty hard on my strings i usedunlop standard tortex picks pack purple mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly the nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several months instead of weeks they re a little bit more expensive then other major string brands but after about a year of listening to these only gone through sets so far they re worth the extra few bucks firm pick just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip once you try these picks you never go back
342	i like them but i love the schaller locks more they don t feel as secure as the schaller locks sorry these are well made good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own will purchase again enjoy these are great i have these on all my guitars only problem is the clip on install to the strap if you can t get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place once installed you are good for life i had one of these and lost it replaced it with the ns planet waves micro clip on tuner which is not as good this tuner has a better higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too easily worth the extra dollar it s a little taller than the micro but still very small and if it s behind a headstock it doesn t make a difference visually the main difference is the height if the tuner width and depth are about the same that also means a bigger readout so not really a con i use it on a godin with a slotted headstock positioned so i can see it between the tuning keys easy to use bummed i lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner i ll be getting another one of these soon should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it alright strings nothing too spectacular about them i m a fan of beefier lows and thinner highs but at the end of the day they re still slinks joyo makes great quality products cheap i love this product it works great all my pedals hove there own power supply
343	i just got these in and i have to say very disappointed it s as if i went into a boy s shop and bought a large shirt and expected it to fit a man what do they call medium or small this large pick barely goes over my thumbnail area i can hold it sort of so we ll see how well it works with my hybrid plectrum project btw i m an average grown man more to come here we go a few months later i just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a large thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick bottom line if you want a thumb pick that fits go to a store and try before you buy good luck to all this tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone or direct plug in for electric instruments this has the microphone feature but is better used with the clip on vibration mode just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat easy to use these items though well made and strong are sized rather differently to national picks with the national i need a large so i ordered large in this item it is however very tight smaller in fact than a national medium thumb pick essentially a waste of money
344	i bought this pick holder because i hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can t play with a pick in your strings i originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock boy was i wrong the picture is misleading this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string it wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks maybe more if they are thin into the wedges on top stays in place well and is very convenient only negative is i don t know how long it will hold up i think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better i can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks seems sturdy enough and no noise issues so i m pretty much satified with it it doesn t leave the house so i m not asking it to handle a lot but with reasonable care it should last a while i use it to clean smudges off of my guitars and to keep the fretboards clean after use it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces it is extremely well made and i have thrown it in the washer dryer and it comes out clean and new looking i keep it in my guitar case and use it often i was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when i was thinking about buying it but i read all the review on it and decided to give a shot i figured for the price in late nov that it wouldn t be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because i bought it to play around with while i visit my family in ca when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised the guitar came in great shape it was packed well and didn t have any damage on it the top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it but it doesn t affect the performance of the guitar it came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once i lowered the action on the guitar it was much easier to play the sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight overall i m extremely pleased with my purchase it sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much the pick guard looks a bit cheap but that s just nitpicking if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one i am extremely happy with this purchase this is my thrid levy s strap and it is as good as the rest of them that i have had for a few years i have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others i have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but i don t see a problem with it so far and i use it regularly i have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer but it is a standard size i prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials for the price the strap works well and i would buy more levy s straps if needed it s a very cute little capo it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it s hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small but it works not much to say here they re knobs they look good are well made and fit perfectly on the cts pots in my guitar these strings are great for a string i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel a string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar and i think they will last longer which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring
345	i have a taylor ga e the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright i tried some martins ej s which i love on my seagull s however those strings just didn t have enough bass and too much highs i bought these recently and i love them they are much better then the original strings very rich bass that really comes out the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have now off to buy some different bridge materials edit i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow every time i come back to it after several weeks i forget that i put the ls on it then i pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are john pearse strings worth every penny these are my favorite guitar strings they are very long lasting and sound great i would recommend these for anyone beginners or even people who play seriously or perform they are very good strings worth the cost i play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun that s all i can say it makes me creative and i have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this it s just fun this is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the shure sm but doesn t want to lay out i bought it myself as a kind of experiment i m learning blues harp i wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing for this reason the mike had to be one that i could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand while my astatic jt has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love i can t easily mount it on a stand and use it for vocals the spherical receiver makes the xm pretty easy to cup in my hands the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand and the low impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance matching and no resulting noise or signal loss the mike isn t perfect but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies here are a couple of more casual notes the mike in the picture looked bluish to me what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish the product description seems to report a weight of ounces i measured this mike at ounces that gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that i ve used the mike has ohms impedance and a frequency response up to hz bluesmen prefer a cut off at to give a midrange boost but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike the mike doesn t have an on off switch perhaps its only real deficiency these switches really are very handy in actual use the mike dosn t seem very susceptible to pops and there is no hiss the mike comes with a pretty substantial hard shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection i find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around or storing this at home then the oversized case should work well i hope this helps this capo helps make aesome music thankful for it i like using it for all kinds of palying like at the beach
346	i think many most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try my favorite picks for the last years are snarling dogs brain picks they re nylon picks that have a raspy cat s tongue surface that makes it super easy to grip i ve also had a few of these gator grip picks for a few years now and i like them quite a bit but they re not my favorite i tend to use something around or just under mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic these picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them sound wise i don t find that they re significantly different from any other pick if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my i ve tried a lot of strings and these are my favorites although i use the heavier mlt strings sometimes these ones bend easier the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less both last as well as the more expensive ball and gore elixir coated strings i have used and i like the sound better originally i bought another snark and liked it well enough i d seen this one on youtube and thought its little bobble head looked kinda silly but then a friend lent me his for a couple of days and i really liked the experience of being able to glance over and see if i was in tune i was hooked i ll look silly if it lets me stay in tune the built in metronome doesn t have a lot of volume but it s clearly visible you also get a little baggie containing three picks the carry bag for the tuner and a battery warranty runs for a year altogether i m very satisfied with this tuner works like it is suppose to good quality i am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song thank you kyser capos i gave these strings a try but i don t care for them that much i have always used sp s or elixir s and i don t think that will change after trying these i really like my capo the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic and it works as it should however i feel like it deserves stars simply because it could be a much more robust product for example i think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer and rounded the back side of a guitar neck is rounded after all the spring could definitely be tighter i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough also the design is fairly nice but it s mostly aesthetic it s not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily don t get me wrong this is a rather good product and it s priced about right it just isn t a high end product star perfect maybe a little bigger than i m comfortable with but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things they keep disappearing
347	i mean you paid for a pedal that if you want to buy from the boss it s about times this price and if you want it behringer it s about twice this price it does what is supposed to and it doesn t have a cheap look for home and garage entertainment is good enough i was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand but now that i know that i like it i m going to buy the distortion red one i m only sad they don t make a noise gate or something similar that would be the top of the deal to be honest i m not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix one of the best names in the business and for the fact it was cheaper than most i m very pleased with the pedal and couldn t be happier obviously these aren t top of the line strings but i used them to record a track in drop c and it sounded awesome after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin d addario is awesome if you keep in mind that they re on the cheaper side easy to use from day one and i am a beginner at the guitar would recommend it to any one this works with equal ease across all six strings or only the bottom three haven t run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet but judging by its performance on the bottom three and its fierce grip it ll do just fine i ve been a musician for over years i ve seen an awful lot of products come and go i don t get excited about the latest and greatest very easily but having said that this is the best idea in headstock tuners i have encountered i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff this item is definitely in the good quality family it s easy to read outdoors in the daylight yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light great design planet waves excellent price go dps works like a capo nothing much to add my son searched for the odd colors so he could see his capo while on stage in near darkness ok its cheap you knew that when you bought it i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture it was only one and it was red broke with first use
348	sounds great i own different gauges i like the gripping surface is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast excellent guitar strings they last a long time sound great and are pretty cheap this was recommended by a guitar repair shop and i have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand it will polish and lube things like floyd roses do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil wipe them down with a little dr duck s ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case the secret is always use the least you can get away with too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever this houses your guitar and i have a couple humidipaks in there because i live in a northern desert not many frills to this bag it does the job
349	great tuner it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar i will buy another one of this this picks are comfortable nice quality they ll get dirty as they are cream or white as i see but worth it wanna play fast take these n try em out nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect i hit the strings very very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet i don t break many strings i bought a cheap guitar that sounded really bad i replaced the stock strings with the d addario strings and it made it sound much better great prce in the old days we used tobe able to buyall nylon clear strings now tis almost impossible with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar one will prefer playing on the hi treble strings very nice resonant and clean not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other supposed to bebass strings i dont know again like someone else noted the obvious sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is gigantic this makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even makes it sound like different geeetars totally sucks bad now oohthanks man i just can t believe how loud this little baby is i also have a watts behringer keyboard amp inputs with lot of fx but it s a littl heavy to move around this little amp does everything i need for small gathering i tried everything as soon as i received it guitar classic mandolin acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampactually the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp the microphone although no reverb or echo is good enough for singing sounds as the true voice of the singer the mp input is which i prefer over the little volume must be controlled by the mp player itself guitar and mic have separate volume control we really need it in summary it s ready to be used right out of the box it only weights lbs so moving around is really easy after reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp for the price about i had to try it when i plugged my acoustic into this i was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate first let s not expect double sound from a portable v amp once that reality is recognized it s realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price i would note that the sound you get out of this amp as with any amp will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you re feeding from i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different one had very rich tone another sounded tinny another had a passive pickup and required i turn the honeytune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup so it won t sound the same on every guitar that said if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good this amp is simply awesome i ve had it only one day so i haven t put it through the test of time but first impressions are that i will buy more of these in the future i need more than one portable amp my sister visited and heard it right after i opened the box and she was impressed as well neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp and i have to say the aqua color is major retro gotta luv it i ve been looking for the portable amp for some time this is the best i ve found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance i don t know as i d pay the for this guitar shops often ask but the amazon price is perfect one last thing danelectro branded v battery included same color as the amp priceless
350	i love these picks and the mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing for the money there isn t a better tuner on the market today this is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really this tuner is s pot on every time and super fast you can move from string to string quick these elixir nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings great product these extra light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead i buy elixir nanoweb strings in singles so i can select the gauges that i like even better a great product no matter what gauge string you choose i have a martin hd with the large grover tuners this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly if you change your strings regularly this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tuners for these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time
351	got these as a gift for my year old nephew he loves them the only problem is that his friends keep walking off with them these strings from d addario are a personal favorite of mine i love the ej light gauge for their size and ease of use i think the light gauge is a nice size that won t hurt your fingers or put undue stress on your guitar not only that but they sound great not too big or not too small i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends to me this makes it much easier when changing strings you don t have to worry about mixing up your strings i ve also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands give these a try i think you ll be satisfied this may have been the best money i ve ever spent for a guitar accessory i can dial the pressure to exactly what i need for any spot on the neck it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise my guitar stays in tune when capo ed i love it i ve used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments they re fairly inexpensive and i ve never had a problem with them never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear abuse and i ve never had a guitar bass hit the floor a couple of warnings here which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole some people put a matchstick toothpick piece of paper or something inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole s too big or has been stripped out i use a touch of elmer s glue screw in the straplock and let it sit for a day you have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn t work itself off the end use a socket to get the nut really tight new straps seem to be easier to secure dunlop cleans the smudges and fingerprints off but i dont know how well it actually polished i like it well enough just make sure you have a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching the lacquered surfaces the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years item arrived on time and as described my son loves this polish cleaner he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny they glisten when he uses this to polish them great product this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars i tried this untreated microfiberpolish cloth on my gibson es because i had heard good things about it we ll begin with some stats the cloth is by and has an border stitched aroundthe edge it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea there is a small warning on theback of the package that states not designed for cleaning electrical devices you can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water rinse it out and hang it up to dry now to thereview my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny i have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body s front and back and backof the neck i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off when going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish what i discovered about this cloth even with increased elbow grease is that it has it s limitations so if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out if the body oils have been there for awhile probably collecting dust then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it i decided to use dunlop s dunlop formula guitar polish cleaner to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely since then i have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the planet waves microfiber polish cloth it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid i also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind you want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play i would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything i gave this untreated microfiber cloth stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort my highexpectations based upon the blurb were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around it was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess nonetheless i like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime i will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time i am done playing nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn t work well that s not the case here this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied i guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration but why go to all that trouble this product lives up to it s calling besides who wants to keep changing batteries in the stobe tuner planet waves when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget i gave it a star rating because the price is fair the product is well made and works and it was shipped well within the promised time by today s standards that s as good as it gets dp this thing is awesome i think it s the best tuner i ve owned and it really does an excellent job it s easy and clear and everything a tool should be it s fast and easy just like a tuner should be very nice clip on tuner for the price i actually got this as a gift for a friend and they seem to really like it no on off switch is a bummer but it works solid construction decent sound comes with a cable for convenience update after playing in a small shed for a while the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a b note we messed with the pa and all the electronics what it came down to was my mic pyle pro pdmic professional moving coil dynamic handheld microphone placement i switched mics and kept them in the exact same position and the rattle went away whats all this mean the quality of this mic is just ok if you ve got a lot of sound going on maybe get a better one i can t find a single complain about this amp the amp modelling is fantastic plug in for a mic cd m player quality driver i m not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website i used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds but you can t ask for much more for the price of you won t be disappointed with this amp for bucks it s a great piece works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass battery is included but it is very small and almost lost it capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration i ve had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years i have much nicer ones now and decided that rather than lend them out for playing i d fix up this beginner uke as a loaner i took off the strings and realized how dull and dry looking the fret board had become i used this product and it really soaked it up fast now it looks beautiful again very satisfied with how it worked what can i really say tunes my entire arsenal from cigar box guitar string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna string getting ready to make few uke s and it will tune them also need a all n one tuner buy this or an i phone the korg is the perfecttuner i use these pins on some of my size guitars not really sure if i can notice a difference in sound between these plastic or ebony pins that i have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra great buy good strong spring and good strong materials the only improvement i would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck the protector needs to be longer as the protector ages it slips off the end if it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help i love this product it is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar you end up using just the right ammount would definately recommend it i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect then i re ordered and i got what i think was an acoustic type because they were the same mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold so i just ended up with two dozen wasted picks so just make sure you get the right one update okay so i just realized that there are dunlop stubby picks and then there are dunlop big stubby picks sorry i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp this runs from my guitar to the pedal works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal this is actually my best cable and i think i will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these great picks not just for jazz though i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel but once you do they are fantastic i recently acquired a guild six string that i strung with my usual ej strings however it just wasn t playing or sounding as good as i knew it could after tweaking the action and restringing with ej mediums that guild has sounds great with plenty of punch power to spare overall i rely on d addario strings for all my instruments what s not to love about a year old family owned company that beginning with the days of catgut has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations beyond great tone playability these suckers are reliable as all get out these days if a string breaks i know right away i need to check the nut saddle because these strings don t snap unless something on the instrument caused damage in fact i used to snap strings every other performance before i learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use nothing but d addario strings i haven t broken a string during a performance in years and believe me i ain t being gentle with em this is a handy little contraption i m using on one of my cheaper guitars it wasn t compatible with the other strap i ve been using and i had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap but it worked well with the strap on my other guitar i think it s a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly you can use a standard eye glass cleaning cloth about quid with this instead of buying a micro fibre cloth at quid they both do the same imo you could also use eye glass cleaning solution instead which i have in the past but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars but not on eye glasses smiles this really does shine up your wood quite well i recommend
352	this is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder why didn t i think of that it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down every few weeks keeps the strings clean and best of all i don t find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since i started using this instead of the cheesecloth i used to use there aren t enough uke straps out there for a good price this one is great i take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller lighter i started playing mandolin back in september and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing and finally decided on the dunlop jazz stubby mm picks once i determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that i won t ever be without one picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most buying them in bulk this way means that i ll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises this strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good also doesn t fit an instrument where there s no place to hook it i returned mine as it just didn t fit well for my uke or mandolin i am using these strings on an inexpensive a style beginner s mandolin these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument i strongly recommend these strings i purchased this model for home use not for a kid s backpack it s solid and sturdy easily holding a song book open not just a few pieces of sheet music it adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening i often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down works for me i m a gadget lover and this is a good one it makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument
353	i thought i was using good guitar cables but i kept getting intermittence with one so i tried this monster cable it eliminated the problem my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff this is minor but no matter what i do it curls up unless you have it fully extended i would still recommend it though after trying out a few other styles and brands i settled on this stand wanting something that would keep my s telecaster from taking an unexpected fall the overall design of the stand is great but i had to return my first stand as there were severe quality issues with the finish there were at least spots where the black finish didn t stick to the metal and i essentially had bare metal spots sticking out the neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about degrees to the right once it was clamped down to the main stand body disappointingly the replacement unit i received also has this issue but only about degrees worth i m going to use this stand in the meantime while i try to find something of a nicer finish and truly worthy of my guitar the tweed really grips on your shirt the quality is perfection and they even give you a little string if your using it for acoustic which i thought was sweet love fender strong and won t tip price is very affordable i own several and have had no trouble with them buy it and you will see i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input sounds fine although that guitar is notably humm y with the single coils i don t feel this cable added any more noise in the line looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought they work great they re quiet and they re cheap what else can you ask for i m very happy with the product there are something special about these strings they ring so bright and beautiful i absolutely love them for my fenders i honestly don t use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele they re gorgeous sounding especially when new sorry fender this one is just a waste of money get something better that doesn t twist up an ravel into knots this is a very good strap lock system i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap recommended
354	its cheap it worx what more to say welp only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it d be perfect nope i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt dblow on bruthas n sistas doc p i wish there was a fine pivot angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth i feel i have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how i set it up i have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as i think i need it to causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth lol this is the least expensive holder i could find nov since it was inexpensive comparatively i will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews don t want it also not sure why they don t make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so a star mechanism star armature design i ordered both this one and the lee oskar i couldn t find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the hohner had raised ends i reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok the quality appears good the springs that hold the harp in are strong but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands i can change harps without removing the rack this was my first shoulder rack and i didn t know what to expect i have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and it s challenging but i can get it done i prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size great quality lasts forever you won t be dissapointed great harmonica rack for smaller harps very strong in the set when worn a must have for any folk player perfect chain for most rock sounds get the strand for a thicker snap i might try out the strand next year i m pretty happy with this one right now the place i live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack i m not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with this rack is constructed better than i had really expected it s easy to adjust however i found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward getting he harmonica unto te spring loaded holder can be a bit tricky still this is a good deal i ve used the tortex picks for a while now and have been really happy with them this pick however takes it to the next level very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick i use the for acoustic and the same holds true great product in case you re wondering about the difference between this hohner harmonica holder and the hohners costing more than twice this one s price this one is made in china while the others are made in germany now i m definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of chinese made products i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there this item however has some of the good and some of the more stereotypical problems of chinese goods pros cheap sturdy and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe i also like the tighter springs though that does take a little getting used to but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort now the cons it s true what others have said the plastic neck tube smells not as bad as some have said but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable i cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at tap plastics for a buck make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee i got the diameter nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other and the neck loop was way off i did my best to bend all parts to even but the flat metal part is tough to shape the reason i didn t return it is that i figure most of them are equally uneven i just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand with little or no machine help to ensure consistency with the work i did on it myself it works fine and is now fairly even and like i said the taller height is just about right for me it s just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren t met like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides all this said the bottom line is that i prefer using this over my german made hohner holder because it s better ergonomically taller holds my harp more securely and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the nouveau single butterfly nut design of my more expensive german hohner knowing what i know of its drawbacks i m still tempted to pick up another as a back up or spare it s a great deal if you re willing to do a little work on it i ll start this by saying i prefer metal slides to glass tone snob that i am so i wasn t too excited about playing with this until i played with it the tone is amazing great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics i now only use metal slides and my dunlop bottleneck
355	overdrive that wont drive you over love it for the price as usual danelectro delivered i love their products for that reason they sound like a couple hundred bucks and yet it s hard to really describe what this pedal does it doesn t distort flange echo or produce a chorus i d heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it and because words don t do an accurate job in describing it i would have probably never pulled the trigger on one even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go as luck would have it i acquired one on trade and i have to admit that i agree with the whole blanket euphemism this stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my blues jr when placed at the end of my pedaltrain right before i run into the amp i don t feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp s tone though i do believe it works even better in a loop i placed it in the effects loop of both a palomino v usa ampeg made and a crate vc a watt usa made el tube amp with celestian speaker and it was transformative to both amps tone in a great way it does very well with single coils it s a pedal that i would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in i don t think it works as well when i run my lp into a jet city combo particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures harmonics that amp also lacks an effects loop and i imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase i guess it s rig dependent but it s a keeper for what it does to the sound of my fender great little pedal for a very reasonable cost this pedal is durable too cause i have owned it for about two years and it has held up great so just because it is a little cheaper does not mean it is not a good pedal sounds great too i would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician they use a heavy metal casing that appears durable and the cord is decent enough for live sound but a very slight hum was present with my guitar harp amp i would pay this price for just the element it is truly a great buy and i would use it for armature work any day i use it for harp harmonica and it works great and it sounds smooth with vocals too i would recommend it to any friend and i already have worth every penny depending on the amp and guitar you have this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer it sounds terrific with my fender strat single coil danelectro lipstick pickups on my solid state amps giving them a warm tube like overdrive it sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp it really sounds aweful with my s kramer loaded with humbucker pickups you ll either love it or hate it that will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use it s a different pedal with every combination the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues the only reason i didn t give it stars is it tends to be a little noisey if you turn the gain up too much you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great does a good job for a basic delay good for rockabilly and s slap echo i needed it for nothing else so i m happy
356	some items of gls work great others are awful don t trust the products anymore it s unfortunate but i don t feel safe with their products that they ll perform when i need them to these strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good if you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the player so i and many others play nickel bullet end if you are playing a stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a whole those two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time i ve been using these for years have proven to me to be the optimal string for the stratocaster these are durable do they last well yes they do i rotate guitars on the gigs so i would say that if i was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as i do through the week i end up changing them out every to weeks and i m playing nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and i put them through a rigorous workout what would that equate to in hours hmmm to hours perhaps maybe a bit more add to that sweat natural oils oxidation and that i don t use cleaners or chems on the strings although i do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel i needed a small capo for my mandolin and so i purchased this little guy works great though i have to put it on at that st fret and then move it up to where i need it don t know what i expected for such a cheap price but this product s quality is in line with its price also the fit over my ukulele s fretboard is very tight making it hard to put on and remove
357	i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market this metronome has distinct audible sounds and a flashing light which makes it much easier for me to see and hear the beats works very well this mike is a great way to start recording at home i use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball i know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price however i find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home the m is well built sturdy and well balanced enough that i have no concerns about tipping even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music the tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort once in place it stays there with no slipping for all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car this is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives and i always have some concern that it will not be what i want when i get it in this case it is a winner delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed a friend of mine has used this stand for over a year and i ordered mine due to the quality and durability i saw with hers much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one i had before a little small tray for large fake books but overall a winner
358	i bought this when i was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be mic d it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin i will be buying more of these this is a very stable comfortable seat the legs are easily removable for storage love that it is rated for higher weights so i don t have to worry about it collapsing this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an key keyboard the front back spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the more common x stand tried several of pedaltrain in the past pt too bulky and pt jr a little to small this one holds my pedals perfectly simple light i love it
359	i bought a cheep violin to decide if i would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping the peg drops really helped keep it in tune i wouldn t have been able to do it without the drops can t play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of peg drops though i don t know why they don t put guitar type turners on violins cellos and bases i have a chezch violin and it s sparked my year olds interest my pegs are in great shape but i figured i d get this oil to make starting to play the violin easier on him this is a really strong capo the spring is very robust well padded and will not damage your instrument i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin takes some hand strength to open it but you don t want a weak capo you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do the great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so i don t have to have a seperate capo for each i also have a capo for guitar made by kyser and i can tell you that works just as well you can never go wrong with a kyser not only that i like the idea that it s an us company i ve had some cheaper capos and they just don t do the job they either don t press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much this kyser will last a long long time my pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as i can remember i d guess they have about years of wear on them i used to be able to deal with it violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem more recently i tried adding fine tuners on g d and a to make it easier to tune but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much i figured i d give the drops a try the change was immediate i was able to work with the pegs more easily and slippage went away immediately i decided to give it hours before changing strings when i did i also removed three fine tuners and still had the control i needed after changing one string things worked well but then i had the peg slip suddenly i figured i d try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault but it ended up slipping loose again i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem after that i had no more slippage but i now have one peg that is binding the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended i don t expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect what symptoms indicate and so forth i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back suffice to say the drops made an incredible difference but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure i d definitely recommend them but i hope to get some comments from users with more experience so i can have a better idea what makes people know it s time to reapply and what they experience when they do it the advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic not metal core strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners the effort i had without the drops made me avoid playing and i was using a yamaha sv most of the time that can be fun but i didn t realize how much i missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune
360	i wasn t quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards i figured i d give this a try i am so glad i did i could not believe how much residue was on the rag after i cleaned the fret board yuk then i used the treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color i d like to say it looks like new but the guitar is a so that would be a stretch but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new i used it on one of my less valuable acoustics but it s still a usa made fender i have such faith in this that i m going to do my gibson acoustic next then i have a couple of electrics i will do when i change strings on them this stuff is great this pickup is actually a really great product for what it is i hooked it up to my acoustic and plugged it into my line amp and shredded a little bit it s nuts being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic i love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a yamaha i currently have acoustical yamaha guitars the fg s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar i usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and i can reach the full length of the neck with no problems it has a deep tone and good volume i give stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player slap these puppies on your ten dollar squier and you ve got yourself a guitar i d describe the sound as a bit metallic ish definitely a sharper tone this one is probably closer to a guitar the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it s just like most of the other made in china guitar from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only but i m not at all impressed one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis which usually means they re a jack of all trades but a master of none i recently bought a johnson jg n a johnson jg n a bristol bd a jasmine s and this yamaha if i d only played the yamaha i d probably think it was a pretty nice guitar but having tried all of these side by side i can definitely say it s not at all amazing the bristol blows this thing out of the water and not just because it s cheaper it plays and sounds better the johnson guitars both have a little higher action not a lot of highs and a cheaper fit and finish the jasmine is nice but i haven t spent enough time playing it to give a true review the yamaha fg gs is definitely neat to look at and has decent mids but doesn t really have a great high to low end punch now it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body but the sound range overall wasn t great the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison also the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same can t help but think that the reviews here are a bit hive mind where everybody buys into a hype maybe i got a dud guitar but i doubt it they re all made in the same factory
361	now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales a must have for guitar teachers imho this is the large i can t see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all the lines for the strings and frets are very close together see my previous evaluation on a similar product it is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be tons of useful information on this wheel my only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written seems like reasonably durable construction compact enough to stow it in a guitar case bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase
362	very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight cannot go wrong with this one this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them quick to set up tear down adjust the bench is also larger than my others very happy for the price different height adjustments i have a few shure sm s which cost more i like the open sound of the pg but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the sm s i like this mic ok but the sm is worth the extra money i think especially if you expect to push its capability okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic a great addition and will serve me well very comfortable bench it s wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use it feels heavy duty and stays still during use very handy to have could peel paper off bottom and stick to guitar or something to keep your picks close at hand i haven t done that myself as i don t want to mess up the finish of my guitar but could see it being handy picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed very durable and they sound amazing i love these drum heads and would recommend them to anyone that needs drumheads i use this for a bass and while i cannot get deep tones it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends tip it sounds better if you don t cramp it all the way up stop at i usually use s but decided to try these s instead i didn t notice much of a difference at first but after a while i noticed that it s easier to tune between the g and d string rd and th strings because the gauges are closer sound is just right for instrumental rock shredding metal and delivering that fatal blow i must have had over tuners in the last few decades and the snark is by far my favorite i change out altered capos every few songs so i have to tweak the tuning many times each gig and this has made it much easier even in noisy clubs with poor lighting i ve been using this bench regularly since ordering it in it s great in all ways but one the rubber feet constantly fall off if you use this bench regularly the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feet solution usegorilla glue epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench this is what i have done and now i have no problem with wandering feet on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble
363	these worked fine the mistake i made was buying them hastily i needed nylon core strings not steel my mistake i loaded them up anyway sounded great this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price so certain compromises have been necessary compromises such as a single supply wall wart partly an advantage to get the ac out of the amplifier itself and very basic circuit with inexpensive parts the preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges and has no provision for load adjustments or the like on the other hand it works well is packaged nicely and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy but want a basic phono riaa amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs also by avoiding the ldquo all in one rdquo tendency of units that include inexpensive d a converters and such for usb output this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog only uses for which it is suited the unit is also very ldquo hackable rdquo if you d like to upgrade things like capacitors resistors or the opamps or use a nicer external power supply the first thing i d upgrade lastly if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge and the capacitance of your phono cables you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly recommended if your budget is limited behringer has done it again the pp ultra compact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like it s ultra compact it takes up a very negligible amount of space it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability it has no trouble amplifying a turntable s signal to line level before buying a preamp amp could only boost my turntable to a easy listening level the noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary with the help of this preamp my amp no longer acts as a crutch and i can comfortably listen to music without my amp s i m turned up to and struggling noise the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point it s not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look it also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black judging from the accessible screws on the side though it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if i wanted this preamp also does not have a power switch but this is not much of an issue it s one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product summary if you need a preamp buy this one it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps i wanted to wait till i got another phono preamp before i wrote this review i did get this from amazontc black phono preamplifier switchablei really needed more aux inputs for cd etc but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others i am using a vintage garrard turntable the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp they are tight but do not make good contact and i need to mess with them this problem is gone with the new preamp overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues if you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where it does sound ok other than being a little bright it does do what is supposed to do i don t do heavy gigging just home studio play but i have had no issues with quality or sound it looks cool and sounds just fine and clear i like the metal connecters they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft it is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price i will be buying these again
364	it can be an octave divider up to two up or down it can do parallel intervals a la trevor rabin on owner of a lonely heart it can do intelligent harmonies just make sure your guitar is in tune so it can track your playing it can do digitech whammy esque divebombs up or down it can do chorus like detuningit can do whammy bar flutter copiesit s a bargainit s very welcome on my pedalboardif it s what you re looking for it s not lexicon it s not tc nor does it profess to be and you know how to use it you really can t go wrong get one and have fun because it s not programmable i m getting another the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate make sure you have a good microphone to use with it the cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for that seems to be a common problem with music recording programs i ve seen heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer guitarist this should come with a good how to use course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications this a solid performing unit at this price point i ve been using this alongside my laptop for as long as i remember and it works the same as the day i bought it the two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to use my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap but this is still a great usb interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately i am missing out on a lot of this thing s capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what i need it for it s perfect i use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks i researched a ton before i bought this one touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys i could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my band s needs just fine i got this amp for my year old son along with a squire mini strat verry good combination my son loves them both
365	boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet good for lead w single channel amps boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strength especially at lower practice volumes should be inexpensive i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat it does that my dial is set at o clock however i could see a tone purist really bothered by the the mid range coloration from this pedal in live practice situations at high volumes it doesn t bother me much in the studio i won t use this pedal for that reason it was the right price for me right now if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more one more thing a boost pedal really shines when it s running to a tube amp for that extra something i don t think pushing the input of a digital amp is a good idea for sound s sake just a thought this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended cut the strings like they was made of paper really good price did what it was suppose no need to say anymore these strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned i bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup i like the lighter sounds out of them and using a capo makes them sound great also these seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of ernie ball strings and i am planning on trying them out on another guitar soon they seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well i use them on an electric acoustic and i am happy with the sound when i play through an amp this is a superb tremolo pedal its dials allow for enormous control of the effect it s very sturdy an often noted feature of boss pedals further it s utterly easy to use allows for both v battery and power supply adapter operation and most important of all it delivers beautiful tremolo note it comes with a v battery installed but it does not come with a power source adapter if the price is more than you re willing to pay consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo this also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much sound manipulation as the boss product it s still quite good but the boss takes the prize i paid about for mine and have zero regrets
366	in my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself i attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually i fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history i just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty just be sure to buy thekorg cm l clip on contact microphone for tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing i bought this one for one of my heavier guitars hoping for some shoulder relief and it does the job it s inexpensive and the padding is excellent it looks like it will last too true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound you still get finger noise as you slide your fingers when setting up for the next chord but the noise is somewhat less i have used other elixir nonweb coated strings and these strings are in par with them i can t speak to the string life the boast of these strings is that will last to times longer and if that is the case i will run out of time to submit my feedback so far now they sound great feel great and if they don t last as long as the other elixirs you ll still come out ahead since they shouldn t cost any more i got it i played for a very while and i just got shocked with a great sound great finished guitar and for the price definitely was a great deal i play rock n roll i m been on the road for a while playin and i can recommended for sure
367	i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic the guitar still sounds amazing and these strings certainly fit my budget and provide a great sound this pedal is outstanding for the price the feel is great and it doesn t move at all when you put it down on the floor the only thing i disliked was that it doesn t support half dampening like most of the higher end pedals around this price range i got this for christmas of and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio great product this review is legit i bought this mixer back in august or september cant really remember but i had a horrible experience with this unit but that s my fault i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything so i didnt know how to use it i hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input and got a horrible terrible mix the hiss from the fan ruined it i nearly had a panic attack so i took like months to do research and found out that behringer made the uca uca for this unit and the mixer to remove the hiss and unwanted noise so buy this with the uca uca to clear up your recordings do not buy a rca to mm cable if your using this for a studio setting like me and if your beginning like me do not let these wealthy people fool you you dont need thousand dollar equiptment the podcaststudio usb from behringer would be fine so all in all with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer the quality was good but the hiss ruined it use a usb audio interface with this from behringer do it if you want star audio quality their website has asio drivers to assist you ohhh and go on youtube and search up uca studio you ll get videos to help please please please please do research before you buy anything good day everyone d great price but very fragile i m a year radio pro always careful about my cables the end separated from the cable not very good quality would not buy this brand again i had read lots of reviews about behringer some people had buzz and noises etc but this is not my case i m not a professional and i just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar pedal my tascam dr my mobile as sometimes i use the tascam to record the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected great product for entry level and great price for what you get more likely known as a guitar compensation device the effect itself it widely used in everything i have couple few behringer pedals some complain about plastic housings but a i don t beat my gear and b plastic doesn t get rust and corrosion the build on behringer are tough and fine to me and the prices make them attainable to all players the only thing i say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals gotta spring for power supply plug if not now eventually because it ll drive you nuts compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just can t not have if that s your thing the sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build so even a cheap one can ring like the best so you got both in one tailoring will add life to even a dull axe some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you can t do without once you find em for connecting pedals in tandem got two of these three packs been using them for quite some time and not one has failed yet nice value as well i like the pedal it s totally silent very bright display sensitive meter in fact the only complaint i have is that the strum every string at once thing isn t as useful as you might think not that i ever use it i d buy this product again if i had it to do over again
368	behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and i was skeptical about paying even bucks for an input mixer my intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox i wanted to use it for recording a drum set i wanted to do it through my m audio profire i had mics stands and a piece drum set i love my profire it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong i have no gripe with it it s just that the preamp only works on two of the inputs so i figure if i get a mixer i can use its preamped channels and run them through the inputs on my interface well it worked it worked great not only did it sound great but i was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic low noise great sound and i still had inputs on my mixer to play around with with my drum set experiment over i now had an input mixer at my disposal add two monitors and you ve got yourself a nice little pa there are no bus outputs so if you re serious about getting a descent mixer i wouldn t bother but as a starter mixer for the price offered i couldn t be happier it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties it may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple self explanatory and effective mixer i didn t need all the flash and the input output jacks on the top is way better than running them out the back of the unit i hate that the eq setup for each channel is basic hi mid low fx pan and level having an fx send is awesome when using it live i didn t think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that the thing is only x it s also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be the xenyx is a great buy had i known i would like it this much i would have paid the extra and gotten the channel one got the mics from dealer fast i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones strong metal construed legs open to set up easy easy to set mic slides in or out up or down peaces stay tight great little mixing console for home use and practice i use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where i need to connect my guitar a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit this thing has phantom power just in case you didn t read that already overall i can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you d need and even has a british eq to help shape your sound a bit cons not many one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh you have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off apart from that the led is wayyy too bright so bright that you can t look at the device for very long and obviously can t make out the writing and control labels on the device i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led i recommend getting this unit and only gave it stars because of the few cons listed above i had the red snark and a couple others this one is the best ive tried so far no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning stars if they had it that high i don t own one but have been playing my sister in law s for the last year when visiting didn t know much about the guitar but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship changed the strings and other than the action being a little high it s as good as anything i ve played for under i honestly thought it cost around so i was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than it s definitely a great value in part because of my experience with this guitar i purchased a takamine g series string last year for considerably more money and it s simply incredible this worked out of the box i have two xlr misc one keyboard and a guitar connected and its very easy to balance the levels there is no noise or other problem so far great for my family looking to buy more soon the evans pedal patch will work for you great it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty i cheap buy and it works excellent i bought mine used when i got it in it didn t work there was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it i had to send it back for a refund i read other reviews that have had the same problem so it seems to be an occasional issue however i ve used one of these boards before the one i used back then was fantastic and everything i needed for small projects this thing works wonders if you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot i recommend i hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels and this just is perfect for the job the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volume wah in pedal i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal the tuner works amazing as well i also love the fact that it connects to your amp via rj ethernet cable i expected this shure sm knock off to disappoint me i was not for bucks this thing does the job there is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about i put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise i recommend this mic for vocals i ve had fun with it as far as longevity and durability time will tell i bought abehringer premium input preampsback in july and i didn t know that i needed this so now that i have it i can finally record to my laptop great product germany company manufacturing is in china i have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two behringer products that are in my hands are very good i previously had the uca and it worked great for me for a couple of years but i noticed the audio went dead in one of the rca phono input jacks i had used those jacks previously with no issues regardless i liked the uca so much that i got the uca to replace it without hesitation plus as a bonus it s purdier plugged it in just now fired up the pc the new uca started working immediately no muss no fuss for the money i don t think you can find a better deal for enhancing your pc s audio versatility i don t know if i ll even bother with the included software as i use a great program called mixcraft btw check that out if you re looking for pc recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other costlier guys anyway two thumbs way up for the uca behringer makes quality products i purchased the excellent c condenser microphone and replaced the usb with the xenyx mixer board when i researched items for a simple home recording setup i saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer and read the item description here on amazon and the behringer website for the c mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the behringer phantom powered mixer boards that was incorrect information this board receives power only via usb and doesn t provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics v when i setup the return of this board to amazon i informed of the error and the appear to have acted very promptly on it as the item description for the c on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for volts although this correction is good it would be more helpful to customers if behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power i ve noticed in other venues i e musician and sound forums behringer gets a bad rap i don t think its due to poor quality equipment i think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale neither the behringer website nor the included documentation with the items i bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts got this because i thought the length would be enough it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length had no problems with this cable though works great this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified although the blue led power light is near blinding the overall quality and functionality of this product is fantastic i would suggest this anyone who is on a budget and would want a good quality mixer
369	i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone it is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside the packing way below average as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing however the great seller i am referring to amazon immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit second unit too had the similar packing but no damages worked fine this was much smaller than i thought it would be but i kinda like that because it takes up no space it does exactly what is expected of it the effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work although certainly would not replace the likes of tc electronics or lexicon relatively transparent and controls are responsive for the money good value i m using four of these for podcasting they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used i am completely happy eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion worked perfectly out of the box and has been used several times to record choirs and piano the sound is clear and well balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around feet this is one of the quietest mixers i ve ever used the range of adjustability is excellent channels fill up quickly but i ve mixed at a time and nearly no noise at least i don t hear any i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle this mixing board didn t look that impressive to me when i first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus the fact that it does not have an on off switch is a minus but basically it works well the eq is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer behringer makes a range of models with less more inputs to suit one s needs so this is great also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything well i would have liked some of these things but then i would have to pay more and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far by the way i am running the following through the mixer an at audiotechnica condenser mic an alesis qs guitar via line in or mic d two krk rp studio monitors presonus firebox everything s been working and sounding great thus far since i m using logic the effects are basically unnecessary but if i ever want to use the board for live use which i may do they could come in handy i d say the effects are just so so behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so i was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far so good the mic preamps sound pretty good clean and relatively quiet the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made it also seems to send hotter signal to my jbl eon s and that s a good thing the built in effects are probably its weakest point i ve heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit i also wish that the control room knob and outputs were independent of the main output slider that would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again it would also turn it into a buss mixer so all in all not too shabby for a mixer but i probably wouldn t use it for recording
370	i bought this because i wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short i m pleasantly surprised with this cable it s decent sound and decent build quality for a good price this cable is great for xlr microphones or di boxes they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality solid stays where i put it and does a great job holding a heavy mic mount and pop filter can t really beat it for the price i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle this mixing board didn t look that impressive to me when i first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus the fact that it does not have an on off switch is a minus but basically it works well the eq is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer behringer makes a range of models with less more inputs to suit one s needs so this is great also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything well i would have liked some of these things but then i would have to pay more and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far by the way i am running the following through the mixer an at audiotechnica condenser mic an alesis qs guitar via line in or mic d two krk rp studio monitors presonus firebox everything s been working and sounding great thus far since i m using logic the effects are basically unnecessary but if i ever want to use the board for live use which i may do they could come in handy i d say the effects are just so so this is a great microphone for bucks did i just say lol it does not have the same sound as a shure sm but it is kind of close i used it as an overhead microphone on drums recorded an acoustic guitar with it and it worked perfect seen some reviews about hiss from this microphone the hiss is from the cheap xlr into connection who uses that kind of connection anyway would have been great if it included a real xlr but cannot complain after i swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it hiss was gone a no brainer really i have been a producer engineer for over o years this is a great utility microphone if you need an overhead or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp slap it on percussion etc it will work just fine the sound it is quite clean actually for it is a steal if this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio as i can never have enough microphones every microphone has it uses i would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality well constructed pro like product
371	as lc condenser it s definitely a light weight but for lesse than a bucks it sounds pretty good used on acoustic guitar with less than satisfatory results but got a great sound out of a violin and a fairly decent voice sound looking forward to more tests when given a budget for cheap microphones the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one i like the fact that it adds a deeper bassier tone to any voice but it s missing clarity if you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity spend dollars less and get an mxl instead it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case i hooked the up to a cheap art tube mp preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it they agreed that the was clearly superior to the v g that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp some vocalists actually prefer the mxl over a couple of my shure condenser microphones bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my bit neo ive been using the mxl mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective used it forabout minutes before crackling and static started had to go back to the until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of i still recommend the mic though it is hotter than the in its highs but with good compression power amp and eq the result is well worth the money this mic is really nice i have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great works great on voice overs singers and rappers that said it won t outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today but with a little tweaking and the right preamp this mic can sound great there was one review that mentioned it isn t for female vocalists i ve only used it on one and it sounded great not as good as the one i used in studio but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available look at this pedal look at what it does and what it costs for a tuner in a pedal form factor and that s if you don t even try to hunt down a lower price by contrast boss s tu is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing and it costs retail yes the housing is made of plastic i don t know about you but i generally won t be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive and if it doesn t so what it s cheap to replace the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens mine s developed a touchy input jack over time it s actually the earlier tu model but i don t know that it s totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair i own three other behringer pedals as well and they re still going strong a tuner is an essential part of any musician s rig and this does the job just fine use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing update after having used a new tuning pedal for some time i will admit that yes this is a subpar tuner however i still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay this isn t a bad investment for a guitarist just starting out this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp really a nice mic i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs makes my voice sound fantastic i read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mine worth a shot if you re on a budget like me really a remarkable microphone for around very sensitive its for studio not live performances be sure to set your daw insert on your input channel with a compressor limiter as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping has a rich warm tone like tube mics compares to a audio tech not in the class of say an audio tech can t beat it for the price nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well i polished my gibson les paul with this recently and i d forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was does a great job who doesn t love these tuners easy to use easy to read and has options that i don t even use highly recommend this
372	i love this boost pedal so much i owned the mxr micro amp for a while but i found that it colored my tone way too much too much low end the mc on the other hand doesn t color your tone at all it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords if you re in the market for a boost or a buffer i d look no further this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing this is a great effect awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should no need for the evh red logo version unless you re a super fan or something i actually believe this unit will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended i put this pickguard in a mim white blonde stratocaster and guitar looks so great i didn t need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
373	i purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin they work well for me the instalition wasn t that hard it took me maybe four or five minutes the screws provided were a bit bigger than my bc rich avenge beast s stock strap system but when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap or wax i used the bar soap though the installation becomes easier once you put your strap in its not comming out unless you try hard to undo the system lol if you need to clean your guitar strap take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks its not that hard though and the reward is worth it these picks play about like a regular triangular pick the rounded ears may be more practical for some players they stand out because everyone loves the idea of them i would definitely recommend any serious player own one pack of these and carry one around because they always get a good laugh i like these picks they look great and work well i have no issues at all with them and they play a little stiff when new but within minutes feel like an old friend great buy for give one to a guitar playing friend and watch eyes open wide with a no wayyy look on their face this pick holder is awesome it just snaps on to your mic stand add picks and start rockin it holds the picks securely so if you re performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick he loved them still has some will this replace a pro fret job nah that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth end results
374	good quality and doesn t cost very much the price is great too glad i bought it folds up well has a black finish on it digital drumset electronic guitar microphone non xlr and a keyboard i got the brady bunch musical here this mixer works great no complaints just works all connections are mono this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar i tried it on bass and it gives you that big raw ad thick stoner metal bass sound i like it for a microphone at amazon may not be the best mic out there but for home studios this one marks the spot get it if you re on a budget i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer this is the imd improvised musical device solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls i plug two cords into the mixer one from each pickup and blend and balance the two pickups it works it cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero bonus it s an active device so it can boost the signal only con is that it runs on v and doesn t have a battery option i can live with that i have a pretty weird pedalboard set up involving an ehx digital memory man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain this does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before i go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be and they get very loud at the top end but i have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around i tested to see if i could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none great rack mount screws rubber washers are perfect lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon i use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile dj equipment and they have held strong these are amazing little inexpensive mixers if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done we have two of these in our vocal effects rack summing our effects from six feeds three per mixer down to two outputs one per mixer the mixers feed direct boxes which go back to the front of house console this lets us have the effects on stage so the performers can control them and send the signal back to the console for adding into the main mix we have no noise problems at all with these mixers and they really solved a problem for me i needed tiny flexible mixers i could preset and fit inside the rack out of the way not only were these extremely inexpensive they work great good luck and good music to all this liitle box works great for my needs i am using three guitars on stage when possible room permitting and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp this way i can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such it also solves a second problem since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs fender single coils ibanez acoustic with fishman piezo and les paul gibson humbuckers i now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match this is perfect for that inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that i velcro to my small pedal board i m glad someone else mentioned the a c plug on theirs being european standard and not volt us standard don t be surprised if it happens to you i bought one and had the same experience i got mine from musicians friend they offered to have me return it but i chose to keep it since i had a volt power supply available from an older unit i long since stopped using no stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn t check their inventory to make sure it was us standard
375	it is a good purchase i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job i would like the plate to be heavier seems a little flexy what a great little gizmo i play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me no more unplugging plugging in between songs just a push on the pedal and i m switching noiselessly between guitars i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well this selector is very basic but does the job if you need an a b box for simple set ups give this one a try it works for me and i dont see anything wrong with it is simple affordable and functional what else can you ask for not expensive not cheap not exactly what i wanted like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points if you use it as an a b one input to outs then you can use the volume controls i did not need it for that if you use it as inputs and out you only control the sum out not the individual inputs thought you could which is why i bought it the page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can but you can not i almost sent them back i bought for a special set up needing to adjust the input levels that i was switching the led indicators when using it as a in out like guitars into one amp or in my case a mando and a midi guitar rig into a single line in are exactly backwards the one on the right red is actually the input on the left and the one on the left green is the input on the right which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them amazon rocks got them in days free shipping where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys who said santa was a scrouge i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket
376	well what can i say it takes a signal and splits it ways offering output at hp level genius i bought it for my church since we re going the hp monitoring route and this was my best bet against the super over priced shure senheiser audio technica overpriced systems i paired this up with the ma and it works great hook up an xlr straight from the di and voila you got both inputs with separate control like i said genius i d give this and a half stars if i could this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch move a cable plugged into it it is so hard to get full sound in head earphones with this i can only hear in one ear in every headphone output and hardly anything in the other i have to always adjust my cable s connector to get any full sound for a second i can still use this but hardly i really don t like this i have already laid down tracks and the process is effortless easy export to protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments for the price i am very pleased microphone is quite good for such price the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones recommend for small budget studios this rack stand is made up of a heavy steel and welded together very well i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under minutes my audio equipment mounted easily with the included mounting screws and everything looks great and i don t have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over it is very sturdy and very stable i recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to audio or networking devices i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly i prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it s inexpensive yet lightweight flexible and of more than acceptable quality the problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness which feels nice at first and feels more studio but when you re actually using the cable it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things for instance monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are for just a few bucks more i prefer pro co excellines since they have metal ends and their lifetime warranty is simpler just call sweetwater which feels nicer to me but i like these just fine i heard about these from a friend several years back i teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services these strings allow me to keep on keepin on for several weeks at a time even with constant usage i wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions these really do work great no more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now i do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my monitors if anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know thanks this product works the way it should be no frills no bs great price at amazon as usual i use this with my small mobile dj setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all what was it brillcream a dab will do ya something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning worth the coin i just finished installing of these and couldn t be any happier with the product it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation i didn t think this was possible but i actually found a product made in the usa i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows i did not have the mis matching color issue that others commented on all i did was contact the seller in my case brook mays music and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all are going on the same wall they were extrememly responsive even sending two emails concerning my request basically saying they would do their best but no promises well brook mays came through for me i received very quickly i might add of these that matched perfectly i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough well made and the perfect length for my needs the shielding was great as well the end connectors were well made and strong i use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out individual volumes controls make it perfect i recently acquired a guild six string that i strung with my usual ej strings however it just wasn t playing or sounding as good as i knew it could after tweaking the action and restringing with ej mediums that guild has sounds great with plenty of punch power to spare overall i rely on d addario strings for all my instruments what s not to love about a year old family owned company that beginning with the days of catgut has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations beyond great tone playability these suckers are reliable as all get out these days if a string breaks i know right away i need to check the nut saddle because these strings don t snap unless something on the instrument caused damage in fact i used to snap strings every other performance before i learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use nothing but d addario strings i haven t broken a string during a performance in years and believe me i ain t being gentle with em my title says it all i didn t like the ac adaptor i did work very well and was strong i liked how solid it was
377	these cables are awesome they do what they are suppose to do and do it well i personally like that they are smaller in the middle and are easier to fold than regular cable if you are looking to connect your pedals and dont want to break your wallet look no farther than hosa inch cable great sound works just like a phaser should i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds i use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect cool pedal solid construction only thing is that it is big one other thing it works better if you put it in front i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal sturdier construction than most of behrenger s other pedals the housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid folks talk about how bad the stock tube is but that has not been my experience i may experement with a low gain jj in the future but the stock tube is staying put for now maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one this unit sounds really incredible when it s running into the front end of my el powered tube amp the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp no suprise there still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone be forewarned this pedal is gigantic in dimension who cares so long as it sounds this good i d wanted a vintage chandler butler tube driver forever but now i honestly don t need one this pedal gets me there on the cheap rugged pedal by a little known company took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye great univibeish old chorus device would like to see stereo output options in future models solid if you have a strat have studied jimi then it will suit you well if you ve got the right physical approach to the guitar itself
378	this device works here s what it does you plug an electric bass into the pedal s instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal s high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp you also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the ohm low impedance xlr jack out you can use just the high impedance output or just the xlr output or you can use them both simultaneously when the footswitch is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box when the footswitch is on an led light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on i put footswitch in quotes because i use fingers to push it but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose when you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it some other functional comments about it it runs on volt batteries or a volt power supply i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter battery life isn t super but satisfactory still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter when the battery starts going it sounds awful but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set also when the footswitch is off and the led is not lit this thing functions as a straight xlr ouput direct box for anything you plug into it you could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist the amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass so just use it as a direct box with the tone emulation circuit off for anything except bass the controls are all rotary knobs except the ground lift switch which is a slide switch the controls left to right top row to second row are drive treble bass level presence ground lift slide switch and blend taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed the drive knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness or edge of overdriven tube tone basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose there is no active passive pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want the treble knob is a or db boost and cut of upper frequency tones the bass knob is a or db boost and cut of the lower frequencies o clock is flat or zero db boost or cut on both the treble and bass knobs the level knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration the presence knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone the presence knob isn t a midrange control but does boost the upper mids the ground lift switch only effects the xlr output jack and it should be left off unless you hook it up and there is hum then you can turn the ground lift on and it might help eliminate the hum issue however it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum the blend knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal s output with all the way to the left being none o clock being and all the way clockwise being cons very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down designed in germany but built in china means you get chinese components and chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing for example at the first battery change the battery clip self destructed as part of the clip s terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries went to radio shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint i ve never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard construction is all plastic the casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes i know not to use my size d foot on it the treble and presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the xlr output for recording or a pa feed basically i set the treble and presence to the point where i hear hiss start then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off the jacks other than the xlr are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal these type jacks are noted for causing problems especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time this unit lacks any dedicated midrange knob but the presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously some people who use this pedal as a stage tool use it as a solo or scoop switch for slap tap solos so the presence bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway pros first and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely this isn t a tech nyc bass driver by any means but works in a similar fashion to one i have a tech bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs the tech sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost i use the behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home if i didn t have the tech unit i might take this unit to gigs but it probably will last way longer the way i keep it setup at home all the time i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal practice type combos many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don t get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp it is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline say anything over about feet for recording the xlr direct out is very useful and the xlr direct out can also be used to feed the pa at a gig if your amp doesn t have a xlr direct out how i use this device i have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the xlr output to connect it to a microphone mixer the output from microphone mixer is patched into a turtle beach santa cruz soundcard in an xp computer i can then record using the computer s recording software practice solo or i can play along to recorded music using headphones with headphones i can play as loud as i want anytime that i want without disturbing anyone most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass so i recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers you can buy better computer speakers that are capable but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable having owned this pedal for about years and knowing what i know about it i would buy it again i would strongly recommend it as a home recording practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong for home use it is fine you can use it at gigs but i d be saving up gig bones to buy something more durable with better performance i m primarily a guitarist but i keep an inexpensive sx bass around for when i m self recording and whatnot since it isn t my primary instrument and i don t play bass live well not yet it never made sense to invest in a bass amp i bought this to liven up the tone when recording in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amp like honestly if you ve been doing some homework about this thing you should know what to think of it behringer s build quality can be dubious sometimes but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn t a picky audiophile this box is no exception i ve never personally played through a sansamp but i would hazard a guess that if you know that s what you want this won t satisfy you if you want something like a sansamp you could do a lot worse than venture the some bucks on this little box to my ears it sounds quite good get it if it fills a need for you and you re broke knocked off a star for behringer s usual build quality although mine hasn t broken from gentle use yet there s nothing wrong with this stand but for the life of me i cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand i ve read some complaints about this unit maybe those folksshould shell out an additional for something better to the rest of you with the storage units this is a great tool my band i to be exact uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track i just loaded the whole pre recorded track into a slot or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background i loadedthe effect into a slot or another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need butdon t have someone else to play it you can play it back using this device i bought this tube to test in a friends fender hrd in the pi spot he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain he liked the result when i switched out the gt ax i want to try a jan at next but the jj is doing a good job for now also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek s for jj l gc s does as described and really enhances your tone good breadth of tonal variations available only negative and it s not huge is that it can get a little noisy when the presence is increased beyond half i was using a bass with two single coils which makes noise more of a challenge to begin with
379	i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome exactly what i was looking for and for the price i can not get a better deal totally satisfied i have a line vetta ii with a floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects for gigs and in my studio including a wah pedal but sometimes i take my smaller marshall down below to jam with friends i just needed something low priced that would do the job for me in that situation and i ended up with something a lot more when i bought this pedal i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now i really like it and for the price i don t see how you can beat it it seems well made and i think or i hope it will hold up well with normal care i ve only ever used my line floorboard and before that an old crybaby for wah effects before but i ll tell you what i really like about this pedal it s spring loaded so it comes back up by itself it says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah i don t even have to think about whether it s on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways i never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage i also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs the only reason i didn t give it five stars is because there s some sort of semi annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes it only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up so i can avoid it if i try i don t know if it s just mine or is something inherent in this pedal i ll update this review if i ever figure it out i like the sound of this pedal it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound i have all tube amps but they are both heavy i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs the to gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank i haven t used batteries in it because i use a spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard if you rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger you won t be sorry does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come was not too expensive for such good quality my st wah this is going to take some getting used to regarding the switches knobs and buttons i am working on getting that nice way sound which i ve come across somewhat it sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords one thing i would have like would be to have some more detailed instructions about all of the functions it offers behringer has never been very documentation oriented if there are still people out there who don t believe in magic just try this it has truly elevated my playing a few notches i d probably have bought another bottle already but this one seems to be lasting forever i ve had it a few months now i use it pretty much a few times everyday and it still seems full if after using this your playing doesn t improve then maybe you should give up guitar i bought the hell babe years ago it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since the same one i have never had a major problem with it the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal its no crybaby and im glad it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn t no matter how much i tweaked it i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more especially since it has the auto off and spring back it really makes my solos rip buy it you will have a ball my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever
380	they work good way to stiff and small for me though great attack but holding onto it is the problem the slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings i imagine it would work great for lead players but i m a rhythm player i got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp like the other reviewers on here i m sad to report that it s quite hissy i had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is i m using a line uber metal boss metal zone ibanez la metal boss compressor sustainer with my skb pedal board the board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up but when i put the eq in with the others there s a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp i m using a peavey special transtube combo above you can definitely hear the hiss not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but i m going to give the danaelectro fish chips as recommended by another reviewer a try i m waiting on the behringer orchestra chorus pedal to arrive and hoping it isn t hissy like the eq is i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has it does a nice job of altering the tone gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds overall i give this pedal a out of stars i like the product a lot for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect it is not so long as i thought i though it would be like the piano s sustainer but it s a good pedal effect my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect thank you i ve heard about the snark tuners before and have seen them once in awhile but while skimming the music side of amazon i finally picked this up and it works great fist off guitar center had this for bucks i know right it was in front of the tag for this bucks and the sp for so i got it but it was in the wrong spot i went got the price tag and after minimal drama they gave it to me for the price they had it incorrectly listed that said the pedal is great the problem people have with the pedal as i can see it if they say it or not is that some sounds don t have the same sustain as a piano or synth sound it has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to pump the pedal to keep sustain and not wash out the tone this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth i have a casio wtk i believe it is as good as you need as said any over sustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again which is the true art of it bucks robbers don t let the system absorbs you this device as others is really great for the money check everything by yourself this is as good as other devices that cost times more behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging i just didn t want to spend on the boss version but you get what you pay for another thing that i hate is it s really hard to change the battery unlike the boss pedals save your money and steer clear of this one i also bought a behringer power amp for that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out if you go very high with the boost in frequencies you will get noise in significant quantities too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation pay the extra money and get something quiet others complained about this and they were right if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap some complained about each band boosting others this is more of a user problem than manufacturing if you want to isolate a frequency range boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you ll get a narrow range in this respect its like an mxr band sweet chorus i have the ce the ce a ce and this one this chorus is my favorite it sounds just right the analog ce is awesome but too weak boss should include a level knob instead of a stereo control anyway this one is a keeper this is probably obvious to more experienced musicians but for amateur musicians like me if you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play then you re fooling yourself you have to listen to your mix by recording it then listening while you re not playing singing
381	quick and accurate i also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though whatever the name this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp the packaging description says it uses the jrc chip and ma diodes and yes behringer got the sound right i d say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals what i love about this pedal is the tone knob for the ts pedals in this price range it s the most useful you can set it high and it isn t too icepicky yet the entire range is useful this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound i prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal or another overdrive it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones i bought this pedal to semi retire an older ibanez ts soundtank the switch on that one isn t as good as the behringer s the behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off i use mainly solid state fender amps and several distortion pedals including a boss metal zone i d bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt the only downside is the slight lack of bass if you routinely run your guitar sound through inch speaker setups esp x and x or a distorted tone with plenty of bass this shouldn t be a problem i ve tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments i use electric guitar acoustic guitar mandolin violin and banjo this one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport it doesn t get in the way has rubber feet and padding and just works simply and effectively it s not flashy looking but then it s never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument or blends in because of its compact size and black color nothing else is as versatile and effective including the multi instrument stands the ones with other shapes of the support arms and other folding designs this is simply the ideal before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar stomp box or amp try this of the time this will take care of the problem if your amp cuts in and out also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a jack in and out of the socket a dozen times the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over good stuff as another guy said not better not bad simply different it s true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not like dunlop has a little bit of more wah range than behringer i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it more expensive than the behringer to my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer cheaper does not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparent more features than dunlop wha sound is not like the dunlop s it is different but nice i personally like so bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic good deal just get it i highly recommend it thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt i can bear it and dig it cause fuzzy wuzzy was a bear and it is green like the frog dig it i must have gotten a really good one cause mine sounds great and is nothing like those on you tube that sound so bad the only bad in mine is that what comes before behind and it is bad i ve been using this amp for a few months and i m very pleased with the overall quality and performance i was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on youtube i ordered it through amazon and it arrived quickly the amp has two shades or flavors as i call it i only use the clean side or input one this is what fender calls blaceface clean no matter how hard you push that channel it won t break up and sounds great with no fx s running i really haven t used channel two much these are all your pre sets which many amps are doing these days i m pretty much old school and like to find my own sound however they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer the amp itself hooks right into your usb connection such as gargeband or other recording boards or software the amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on it s a loud watts i have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems if your looking for a studio home st amp you can t go wrong with this guy it s now my go to amp in the studio you can make this amp sound many different ways and with an fx chain in front of channel one how i run it the sky is the limit haven t used the software that you need to download from fender but will look at it later right now this amp doesn t need to be tweaked for me i loved it right out of the box give it a test drive and let your ears decide i had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk and since it was off to the side made it tuff to watch the level meters this clamp on boom serves the purpose but has a hard time holding the weight of my shure ksm condenser mic i tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it to keep it from sagging very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue i wouldn t recommend this if you re doing a lot of recording but it is sufficient for my home studio if you own more than pedal and we all do you need this and the spot adapter it will save you a lot of money on batteries and aggravation when you battery runs out on stage it s worth it s weight in gold and rockisland sound sends it out fast you can count on me for future purchases thanks guys i don t know much about delay and i ve never really used it this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay kinda makes you aware of what you are playing fun with blues chorus sound yep original posting my first mini purchased over a decade ago was a bad investment the four neck bolts continually came loose no amount of tweaking could get the intonation right note adults should probably play the mini strat tuned up i play mine at f bb eb g c f or if they have large fingers they should probably use a capo with standard tuning and heavier strings so the string tension is similar to their full sized guitars the pick up pole pieces didn t align with the strings and the finish was uneven it cost and i figured i got less than what i paid for it was clearly a toy and i sold it for without regret three or four years ago i extensively played a hello kitty mini owned by a friend it cost her and after i tweaked the intonation and the string height a bit it was a playable instrument i figured she pretty much got what she paid for a decent little sized traveler recently after reading that fender had upped the build quality of their oriental squier guitars i again purchased a mini i couldn t be more pleased right out of the box everything about the instrument was spot on the construction was rock solid the neck was straight the strings were correctly positioned the intonation was exact and the finish was flawless it was in two words masterfully made i figure i got at least worth of guitar for how cool is that the sound of the current mini is classic fender single coil shimmering with bell like overtones the pickups are functional if a bit thin sounding compared to the seymour duncans i have on my full size strat the six in line enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping the neck is perfectly finished and fast because it s a sized guitar the first and second fret string spacing might be too tight for adult players with large fingers but for everyone else including fortunate children the current mini is a sweet ride and at its present give away street value this has to be one of the most fantastic bargains in the musical kingdom bravo fender june update the mini has become my preferred go to electric i now have one for jazz with a single lace hot gold in the middle position with a custom pick guard from chandler music s pickguard heaven see attached photo and a very versatile one with a lace red silver and blue pickup set why for the same reason john lennon once owned a sized guitar i suppose obscure chords and finger patterns are easier on the hands because fingers have to span less distance i believe the slight tonal inaccuracy of the scale is offset by increased finger placement accuracy try it and i think you ll like it there s nothing not to like about this capo i have two of them i ve played guitar for over years and have used other types of capos i like this one s low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard by turning a knob to tighten it rather than rely on a spring as on the clip on type it takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip on type but i like the results better sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me many seem to complain about the plastic housing but i m fine with it seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so sounds great but i also have a berhinger ultra metal that i think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this note i use it with a marshall jmc head a marshall jmp head and a crate blue voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent i ve got some videos on yt if you search um jmp and blue voodoo out the pedal works as described the draw back is the battery installation you have to take the pedal off to access the battery the other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use i purchased a power supply to go along with it the problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for it s ok for the money and works good i run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound i am looking for i mainly use it with a large body f hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth i m not going to do any explaining about the science behind how this pedal works i m just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone this definitely isn t a boost and it s also not an eq the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone essentially this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing the lo contour knob doesn t increase the amount of bass produced by the amp rather it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass and low mid tone to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased but it hasn t you re just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh that s not to say that you can t dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something indeed it ll make those searing lead tones even better now i gave this product stars not because i ve had any issues with it or haven t been in any way unsatisfied with it but rather because it s really a fairly subtle effect at first i almost couldn t tell a difference between having it on and off with time i ve been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone but it doesn t make a night and day difference i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you re happy with and just want to make it even better this pedal won t make a cheap watt solid state combo sound like a tube half stack it won t make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before in conclusion though i definitely wouldn t put this pedal into the must have category it definitely improves the quality of my tone this is a pedal that i leave on all the time as it improves both clean and distorted tones i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp this runs from my guitar to the pedal works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal this is actually my best cable and i think i will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these i was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solid state amps so i ordered a vht special six supposed to be the best small tube amp for blues harp i also ordered a peavey kb solid state keyboard amp then i ordered this pedal and three others graphic equalizer mxr carbon copy delay t rex reverb i figured that i would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo well everything is being returned except this pedal i found that when i plug this pedal into my old watt peavey rage i get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals more tube like sound than a top rated tube amp and if i want a cleaner tone i can dial it back or bypass it altogether my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery you must use a v transformer which is not included oh well my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway yes it is made of plastic but if you are reasonably careful that should not be a problem update i just found that by plugging into both the high and low jacks at the same time on the vht amp it now produces the sound i will keep the vht and use it instead of my peavey rage with this pedal the sound from either set up is pretty close but the vht requires less fooling around with adjustments and is more resistant to feedback i still might keep this pedal though cause it s easily the next best thing to the vht special tube amp
382	i love it im using this mic to record my vocals for my home made demos it works just awesome quality and price im just satisfied love these guitar stands sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price you will pay up to x more for similar stands great bargain i purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and kicking the tires of this one and it s competition i will tell you up front my decision to buy the dr mkii over the zoom h came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer i m a musician and a wanna be videographer since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test i read about dr mkii vs zoom h and listened too on youtube i decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same size most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between and don t even have high quality microphones so discovering i could toss an mp of the song i was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise this is the better choice for musicians other features i appreciate about the dr mkii the adjustable microphones quick turn on and being armed to record the file system the low battery consumption i should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record after all everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up power it up and start recording well i got a recording without sound the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero once i figure that out all was right again in my universe you will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation i found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing the more aggressive recording level solved that problem i purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results i still don t know how i will solve the wind noise issue when recording ambient sound microphone capsules facing out since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the xy pattern position i m sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders my new fascination is with the song bloggie swivel camera lense they are inexpensive now on craigslist these days and with the dr mkii all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality i get from the bloggie one last detail at the point of purchase i discovered amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the dr mkii to the same price point as the zoom h win win i got what i expected with my purchase you will too regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing so when i was earnestly considering ordering this string i read the summary in which it was stated elixir strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your dna and other contaminants ohhhh protects my string from dna yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right in fact it s the worst contaminant ever worse even than the oils and acids on our skin worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the dna from exposure because the dna is the blueprint of those cells contained deep within protective walls but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings honestly it s like none of us have ever attended a biology class because we re musicians as i read the reviews i noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo i noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from amazon hmmmm the first honest review i found was one which said these strings sound somewhat artificial ah finally one of the real reviews look the product may be good or not it may be the best string ever or not but am i going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently can t stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype we re musicians not morons if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life no matter how heavy the marketing hype if the string is bad you ll only sell one set if it s good you don t need the hype edit follow up after reading numerous reviews this does actually seem to be a good set of strings which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldn t need spin to sell just sayin
383	like title says the item does what it s supposed to you get the headroom you expect from a dollar item i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs i ve had it for a few months and i m experiencing some noise on the pots which i didn t expect i thought it would ve lasted a little longer i can open it and clean the pots but again i expected a little more life out of it battery operation would ve been nice but like i said does what it is supposed to well enough that i ve bought of them to test i installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my s the pad has a larger surface area see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots so i guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area but it s really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise the material is nicer softer than the original so that is a plus every so often i would flip the headphones around to see if i could tell anything the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it but seriously if you had me blindfolded i wouldn t bet my life that i always knew which side were which but in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up i can t imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time sound difference yes one side in my test sounded better i felt until i switched them around just like eyes your two ears are not equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates i think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it i would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc it becomes highly subjective and i wouldn t buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims if you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive if you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but i m glad i didn t pay any more for them than i did from amazon that s my cents this is a pop filter it does a fantastic job at that the plastic rings feel a little cheap but that is just because they need to be lightweight ultimately this is a great pop filter and the goose neck is very strong but flexible i would highly recommend this piece as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio the idea was to give the vocalist instrumentalist personal control over their own levels without the engineer having to change any settings manually the item works great for that as long as you re not using a powered microphone if you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing and interference when the monitor and microphones are plugged in plus the hum buzz is so loud you can t hear anything from the microphone the only way i ve gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a direct box and then into the board i m told that a hum eliminator would do the trick but that s another i really wasn t planning on forking out i d rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalist instrumentalist than pay an extra at the moment again it s very good at what it does if you don t power the microphone i have been playing music for years and often i lose my picks during a performance i took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers best pick ever this gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the more me setting it s simple easy to use works great this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe i have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and i love them all
384	this is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast especially if you are using any of the xenyx or other behringer brand mixers it also works with other mixers as well this is a great inexpensive way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me as a musician i wanted both a pa and an instrument amp but i also wanted extra inputs and outputs this has it all whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa to your guitar amp or from it and even play your mp player while you play and sing if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it the tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a speaker link to a bass amp or sub woofer and you definitely have full sound certainly loud enough for a man band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music i know it s a copy of other speaker amps but its a behringer i think it s a wonderful and adequate must have for any musician i use this with a behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music it was just what i needed to give me clean sound running it through the usb not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like i was in a studio i highly recommend it i m using four of these for podcasting they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used i am completely happy ok i understand it now i use abelton live and thought this would be and easy read cheap interface to record some instruments with wrong i am returning it it does not work has no drivers and is not detected on my mac my mac finds everything bought the focusrite unit instead got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings save your money and time buy the focusrite interface or one of the others yes over but you either want feedback hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance it also lacks plug one rca input you need an addapter not what i thought i was getting dumb me it s hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does it works and it s by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer i use it with audacity at first i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss after fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out i thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product the next day i fooled around with it more and realized i needed to turn the mic input down in audacity and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer when i did this it completely shut out the hiss i ve been making great recordings since it s a plug and play tool but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like i experienced however they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well for those wondering about latency obviously there s some you ll get latency with any type of recording device you just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program the only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high it does not sound like that in the recordings though so it s ok i can deal with itthis is a very good product and can t be beat for the price when it comes to quality you have to set it up correctly when you do set it up properly the quality is fantastic it would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it though this keyboard is pretty dope i bought this a while back when i bought my samson key midi keyboard it s been a little over years and i ve used it ever since i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently you can t go wrong with this stand you can spend a ton more for a studio level multi channel interface but all i wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out x on my bargain basement pc and this fits the bill works perfectly with audacity and windows plug and play i have used a variety of these types of adapters in the past and these are an excellent newer version in this case i bought just one quick release to use for mounting a kick drum microphone that has the stand adapter permanently attached to the microphone with this quick release installed on the stand and the microphone the kick drum microphone now mounts to the stand in mere seconds and stays in place very well i don t quite know why the locking ring is silver on an adapter that is black everywhere else but at least the ring is good quality and the threads are clean and precise i m reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my behringer xenyx mixer and i finally did after nearly throwing in the towel turns out i was using my mixer s cd tape switch incorrectly thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback i finally went on you tube and found a behringer guy that has a video that s less than minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple i was doing wrong i was over thinking it once i got it to working correctly i could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly including the control on my pc that controlled the recording volume for this unit so now i m looking forward to doing some real recording with it using audacity as my main recording software edit i did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really really pleased with the results i can hardly wait to do some more recording with this so to the arrogant salesman who bad mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a lexicon unit i won t be needing that i m quite happy with this little interface thank you very much and to everyone else don t forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your pc and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on board sound card thanks behringer this is a great value used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older strat type guitar and it sounds great the diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original chinese pot so i needed a cheap reamer purchased through amazon to enlarge the pickguard hole it s a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness nice big lugs to solder to aloha friends simply put if you have a ukulele then these are the picks that you should be using cheers
385	let me begin with a public service announcement if you want to buy other ezdrummer expansion packs you need to buy this product first important update toontrack is scheduling the public release of ez drummer in may if you buy ez drummer from now until then you will also get the download for bear in mind ezd is a completely new different program from ezd and so i would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock ezd pop rock kit which has some very kit pieces in addition to the ezd default kit which is more reminiscent of the rock expansion kit from what i ve seen ez drummer also gives you the ability to mix mash kit pieces from all expansions and so to me this makes ez drummer a must buy based on the sheer customization available resume normal programming if you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit ezdrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you ll find it s very easy to use very easy to program and overall a well made product you might be tempted to compare ezdrummer to its bigger and better brother superior drummer made by the same company superior drummer is superior to ezdrummer but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close to life sounding virtual instrument there are ways to improve the off the shelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately youtube has plenty of video tutorials on this but what you want to do is open up your digital audio workstation pro tools cubase etc and set ezdrummer for multi track output from there you ll be able to tweak the different outputs ezdrummer has as if you were in a studio and had mics at your disposal most high end professional studios use about mics to capture everything on a drum kit and so virtual mics is nothing to scoff at kick drum snare top and bottom toms cymbals overhead and room once you have each of those outputs running you can perform individual eqs to change the tone dramatically adding a touch of distortion gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound really close to life in reality once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced it only takes a trained ear to tell that it s a virtual kit as far as the expansions go if you are looking to record a particular style of music then i highly recommend buying the ezx kit that goes with that genre the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above but only for rock as for me personally i did my best to eq and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone but in the end i found the rock kit lacking especially since it s a tight kit toms cymbals hi hat snare kick i got this to power my danelectro honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy it s a power adaptor so it isn t too exciting but it works fine the low e tuner on my lp standard broke about a week ago the back came off and the tuning handle popped out i never liked the ones that were on it but i didn t want to drop the unless i needed to i came across these grovers they had good reviews and the price was right took me about minutes to replace all the tuners and re string the guitar the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced it s hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as i haven t had them on for long enough they seem better though as the b string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly i decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these grovers they fit better i e tighter nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug i like them and glad i purchased them so far a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband the bad reviews here are bizarre written by inept people who either can t handle the install or have a buggy pc or os i was up and running minutes after i tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging there s plenty of specs details videos on the interwebs about this software go do some research see if you like it it s way better than the drum kits that come with garageband and there s plenty of kits to expand with i got the vintage rock kit and i love it almost as much as i love pizza which i will marry some day i like a cheese pizza some call it plain but with the right blend of sauce cheese and crust there s nothing plain about it it s somewhat complex much like myself we are a perfect match pizza and me we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom i m not exclusively a thin crust guy sometimes i dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish the only weak point in this pizza i mean software is that you can t do a cymbal swell apparently it s the same with all these virtual kits regardless of brand but it would be nice if someone toontrack would address it by including a side stick attack on the crashes if you try to do a cymbal swell you hear the initial stick on cymbal ting with each attack so it s kind of a ting ting ting ting sound instead of bwooooosssshhhhh i m sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a ting ting bwoosh loop no ting ting do i get a fortune cookie with that pizza time ohhh myyyy loooove my darlin i hun ger for your crust
386	i have a solid non weight relief les paul traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me like these better then the bulkier dunlops works great pretty simply to swap out the old springs for the new ones i d say there was a slightly more smooth feel now when i use the whammy bar i got this for my line pocket pod it works great so far and was way cheaper then the line adapter for anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind i mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used so i wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose also i didn t want to have short strapletts dangling from my guitars while it s being displayed so for the couple bucks they cost and minutes i get everything i wanted quick release and reattach of the strap the piece of mind that it s not going to just randomly drop one day and they come in all the standard finishes chrome black gold nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display i have these on all my guitars and always will as an added bonus once you have these on multiple guitars you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear
387	these screws are not a shiny chrome so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black fender strat body they are good quality screws i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality thank u guys another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier better looks and function tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides for performing i d go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price would definitely purchase it again works smoothly built like a tank and looks good as well i ve tried other passive volume pedals that didn t work this one works worth every penny these aren t usually my go to strings but d addarios are a good solid sounding string they last fairly long when taken care of and don t usually break too often i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing they will continue to be my nd string of choice as they ve not failed me any time i ve purchased them definitely recommended the locking tuners are a great add to my strat they went on easily but i noticed they are staggeered so make sure the the taller tuners begin at the low e after the install i stringed it up and played for a couple of hours cosmetically they do look cool and functionally which of course is the purpose they keep it in tune i am not a big trem guy but when i use it i do not now have to worry about its tuning i ordered these because i wanted to deck the tremolo on my strats because i don t really use the trem i have a modern american standard and an american vintage reissue hot rod strat there are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as i can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black my standard now has black and silver springs but the hot rod has of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with easy to install and works like a charm very durable cables i ve used them all fenders aren t bad i have used these without any problems whatsoever see for yourself they will always sound the same as the very first day i love this strings currently on all my guitars great value works well tunes tight and is cheap when the battery is run down the screen darkens but it still works what more is there to say i have a set of the original locking tuners on a ish strat so i decided to try these on a fender telecoustic guitar i have that wouldn t stay in tune these fixed that problem it stays in perfect tune now this is a great invention i have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this it really saves on batteries and extension chords it is well worth the money nice solid no frills guitar strap i used this on my stupid heavy agile guitar and it helped a lot my main headphones before were hd s which i thought were pretty good until i got these i have several pair of hd s one for mixing audio one for practicing with drums since they have decent isolation and one for her to use i have one of these and the amount of detail is great i have a set of m audio bx a s and these have a touch more clarity which considering the price difference wow for mixing audio though can t use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right but i think these will get used for mixing more and more with the finalizing on the bx a s i didn t know headphones could sound this good nice straplock system very easy to install as compared to other systems the system is a secure locking system this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal i could not beat the price the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal it is well build and i can use it on other boss and roland gear also it not to big it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board very happy with this item nearly all of the reviews i read on these were very positive and i concur these are very nice solid tuners especially for the price they do add a little noticable weight to the headstock but it s not a problem unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat they look very similar but the two pins are approximately th of an inch further out from the shaft so i m going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them worse the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so i m going to have to fill them first the quality of the locking tuners looks great i only wish that they d show a diagram with the specs written on it so that i could have known that these don t fit my guitar my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets i recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright incredible i ve been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over years ago i use both electric and acoustic the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will every once in a while i ll get a dead string i ll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge same thing with strings that break while tuning them up i just slapped one of these on my reliced mim fender strat it looks very slick only issue is that it got scratched already after having it for less than a month for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install you will like them on the guitar i do like these strings had a few packs of these from christmas opened up one recently and the string or st string was not in there next time i m gonna have to open up the package to make sure they re all in there should measure them too didn t open them to keep them sealed until i was ready to use them no more wow this little amp packs tons of tone sound hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully the clean channels are really clean the dirty channels are just plain nasty watts is enough power to blow your socks off lots of bang for the buck here i had trouble with strings going out of tune too often installed these fender locking tuners and voila amazing difference re stringing is much faster now and tuning is fast no long loops around the tuning pegs holds up much longer rarely need to re tune now even after lots of bending and vibrato i love the ernie ball super slinky strings and fender stainless steel strings also my opinion is every strat benefits from these tuners they should be standard on both the mim s and american strats it is not a replacement for a ts or but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough easy upgrade fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners make changing strings a whole lot easier glad i did it
388	was upgrading the chrome on an mim perfect fit used switchcraft jack includes screws and washer for the jack looks great they do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey works great i use this thing several times per week in rehearsals and it always does the job my only critique would be in battery life maybe a different setup it uses aaa batteries would provide longer life otherwise it s great not very bright not very flexible too big clunky i really don t like it i wish i had went in a different direction my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions this is the neatest little light i have ever seen it takes aaa batteries included but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out and has nice leds the lights are bright enough for my something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand battery life so far has been at least hours actually probably hours as my daughter has been using the light also i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable a real needed item is you play in darker rooms
389	purchased the string kyser capo when i meant to get the string version slightly longer stronger spring but find that this string capo not only works great on my string acoustics but also works on my string acoustic with a little adjusting quality seems top notch design is simple and effective i have been using the behringer acx for six months now i was impressed early and still am very satisfied with the performance it is a straight forward channel acoustic amp with some modest effects one would have to be filling a large venue to need more than this quality amp can provide i m running preamps from gibson j and a taylor ce and they both sound amazing and i don t even know what to do with the rest of the gain the music from these instruments is clear bright deep and the sound is a great reproduction of the instruments themselves behringer s mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price i say mission accomplished amazon was seamless to work with and with free fast shipping the whole experience has been great man how did we get by before things were so cool and easy push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep very well made no problems should be able to stand up to any use or abuse i am so happy with this amp i ve had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing on a couple of occasions i have plugged in my acoustic my mic and my buddies mic and it still handled the load and sounded good i m impressed i even have a digitech pedal that i use with my fender strat and it sounds amazing i highly recommend this amp fender springs you ll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole there s too much tension to do it with your fingers my american special strat came with springs and now has the five i find it stays in tune like a instrument should now
390	i have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market this metronome has distinct audible sounds and a flashing light which makes it much easier for me to see and hear the beats works very well very nice metronome with just enough features in particular i love the name based tempos displayed on the face many metronomes do not have that feature sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin it seems to be accurate and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself the tuners i have for my guitar banjo have modes for use as a metronome the problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome i find them annoying this metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial the speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed and there are two clicks to choose from the metronome has a flashing light too overall a very useable metronome stars good quality bag for my epi lp fit like a glove in fact i wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories the only complaint i have about this is that there s no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over this probably doesn t matter to all of y all though other than that it s a very nice machine with a flashing light and two click options easy to use and quality built pegleg volume control is nice two clicks to choose from the low click is better than the high one to my ear i would recommend this product
391	i expected this to come with a dc adapter nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn t be any or i could have ordered one the product is good surprisingly loud the bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles once the battery popped out by itself when i played a low e but that s no issue i have only used it with a v battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain i hope that doesn t happen with an adapter it s a nice little amp good for carrying around if you have long fingers you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it s height it s that small a guitar strap a backpack and a ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it the distortion it gives is good not good for palm muting this is nice for practising randy rhoads the doors type of rock where not many effects are used also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring and inner many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one it s easy to change the polarity open the box of the adapter and exchange needs soldering obv the red and the black wire places showed up in two days and it works great looks solid nice construction quality cord w right angle for yea d i have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex space and noise is an issue as a beginning guitarist i contemplated a small amp but decided on the mini tone master because in my apartment the smaller the better also i had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that i am i just wanted something no frills that was small compact with enough quality sound to help me as i practice the mini tone master delivers well i was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone it does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery battery life is also pretty good i ve had the same battery in there for several months already playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far it is a little frustrating sometimes as another reviewer mentioned to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling i found a setting that was acceptable to my ears while i didn t need volume this little guy can be loud no weakness there i also plugged an acoustic electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well overall dimensions x x very nice travel size sound is about what you would expect it is basically a toy if you use more than of max gain it sounds awful i turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies i am using it with a fender starcaster when i travel for work hotel friendly i think it s over priced but i think it looks good and it seems durable it really pains me to give anything but a star review to a boss product since i m such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall those compliments apply equally to the cs compression sustainer and it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less reliable brand in my signal chain however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know the two most common complaints that i see are that it adds noise to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit the former complaint is probably true though if you re enough of a hobbyist to use a compression sustainer you re probably already contemplated using a noise gate suppressor such as the boss ns problem solved as for the latter complaint changes tone that s also true but it s not necessarily a bad thing if you like the tone that results the whole point of the cs is that it s supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it this can result in a muddy neutered tone though you can play with the tone and other settings to help it i also find that with the settings all at o clock the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings really while boss pedals are considered to be expensive compared to many of the other effects out there the cs should really be viewed as a budget or entry level compressor when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a keeley compressor costing north of the best thing you can say about the boss even compared to the similarly priced mxr options is that the cs gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price the biggest negative of the pedal in my opinion is that the resulting sound might seem a little too compressed but there are a lot of things you could do with a cs and it works best paired with other pedals chorus delay some distortions that you re trying to smooth out ultimately it s a pedal that could have been better though there aren t too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of anyway
392	i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin ny i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design works great and base is out of your way much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
393	behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and i was skeptical about paying even bucks for an input mixer my intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox i wanted to use it for recording a drum set i wanted to do it through my m audio profire i had mics stands and a piece drum set i love my profire it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong i have no gripe with it it s just that the preamp only works on two of the inputs so i figure if i get a mixer i can use its preamped channels and run them through the inputs on my interface well it worked it worked great not only did it sound great but i was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic low noise great sound and i still had inputs on my mixer to play around with with my drum set experiment over i now had an input mixer at my disposal add two monitors and you ve got yourself a nice little pa there are no bus outputs so if you re serious about getting a descent mixer i wouldn t bother but as a starter mixer for the price offered i couldn t be happier it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties it may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple self explanatory and effective mixer i didn t need all the flash and the input output jacks on the top is way better than running them out the back of the unit i hate that the eq setup for each channel is basic hi mid low fx pan and level having an fx send is awesome when using it live i didn t think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that the thing is only x it s also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be the xenyx is a great buy had i known i would like it this much i would have paid the extra and gotten the channel one i took a chance with this one since i am desperate to find a mount for my mxl microphone i originally bought a universal mic stand from guitar center which cost bux by the way that didnt come close to working but this one worked perfectly thanks you samson i ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on it s especially effective when the microphone is on my desk where my computer tower which has fans is directly under it it s not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing on top of all that it looks nice too if you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk you should definitely consider getting this along with a solid stand and a pop filter fits mxl cube mics perfectly sturdy and easyt to setup ordered two more rare to get items these days that exceed expectation while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm threading but it does not so if you re threading matches the ksm look elsewhere the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at yes does it work well if you can securely close the little gap between the at and the shock mount then yes there is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the at only other thing is that the colors don t really match up well but i don t really care its a good shock mount ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one i don t really use mine since i have carpet on the floors that doesn t like the mic stand shake too much i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard folds up easy so i can tuck it away it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys as you lower it the support spreads out wide good quality adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard i have never been let down by ernie ball strings they produce a bright clear sound and for every other string in their price range they are the best way to go i only use them and i have been playing for a decade they stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings whenever i buy a new guitar and change out the factory strings i am always shocked at how much better my instrument sounds this is the best usb condenser mic i ve ever used i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr i bought the at xlr version simply due to the fantastic results i ve achieved with this one i only use this microphone for podcasting i do not record music with it but i haven t tried yet if you re curious as to the sound quality listen to my podcast rock crushes paper on itunes and zune marketplace just to give you an idea of what i m using windows gb rampentium dual core ghzadobe auditon the build quality is fantastic built like a tank really the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand yes it s a tripod stand but i can t imagine actually being in a spot where i d rather use that then the on stage desktop mic stand anyways great mic can t recommend it enough it s made me check out other audio technica products i haven t used this mic much yet but so far it has a great sound it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music for bucks i don t think you can beat it i m happy so far i may buy some more of them it is not too short as one reviewer complained it is a standard length just like the sm great item sturdy had it for a few weeks now small light durable holds the strings down perfectly too great capo i am completely blown away with these headphones the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic i bought this microphone for youtube podcasting and it does a really perfect job the quality is great for me it was what i had expected it to be i also bought a desktop mic stand with it as well as a shockmount and popfilter highly recommended wow i will never buy another sm again i can t believe i m writing this but it s ture i am so psyched that i found this microphone it s perfect but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me in fact and it might just be in my head but i now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp but everyone else has talked about sound so i want to talk about build quality it s solid has some weight to it and the plastic at the top feels exactly right so far it hasn t come loose in the way that sm s do if i handed this and a sm to my grandma who doesn t know any better she d probably guess that the es was a bit higher end i continually look at it and can t believe i only paid for it get one nah get a bunch sell your sm s for and turn them into two of these magic i ve only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well the cover is supple and easy to coil not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip solid plastic brass threading adjustable pivot screw i ve always been pleased with on stage products even down to there cheap clips this is a quality product super fast shiiping through amazon as always the product is well built easy to use pretty straightforward it s perfect for my samson mic
394	this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig very cost effective great price i purchased this sometime around september and when i received it i tested it and it seemed to work correctly i ve had no trouble with it that i can remember think of i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store who doesn t need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesn t work very well the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate it gets you in the ballpark but just barely strike a note once and it s sharp play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better i have used these and i noticed this capo is a cut above the rest it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away i do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed does not need and installation and setup this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house works out great for my two ukus hung it on the wall looks good and is easy to adjust etc some say this capo work bad i have to ask are your guitar is good enough to use this capo or are you know how to use capo i m more than years of playing guitar this capo is worth the price good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts best recomended quality and price ps may not for very big guitar neck enjoy i have bought of these now for me and a few friends and they work great i am sure they will wear out in time so i have a couple extras but you can t beat them
395	i ve got two other levy s cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they re fantastic i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what i had bought before i suppose it s just easier for theno big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and you re a big guy like me and or you play with the guitar bass around your knees you may not be getting what you thought in any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last so far this cable has worked very well it has had no issues at all for the money you cannot even make your own they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable i have to take my glasses off when i use them but other than that exactly what i thought they d be when i ordered them these are good heads i have played them on several drum sets and have been pleased with their sound look and feel this is a super solid price too takes you hours to play around with all the sounds built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage nice and loud in a small package
396	i have a fender t bucket acoustic guitar and i put heavy guage strings on it as beginner these strings were not good for me i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings good quality glad i bought these strings rust very easily yield fairly poor tone and break often though they have the same bending ability as these strings are beyond amazing switching to ernie ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar and if you do any blues playing at all extra slinkies are for you they bend and bend and bend are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos and give a great sound whether you re playing gritty or bright i also play country and punk and these strings let me get enough twang and beef respectively to play those styles as well the best you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put ernie ball strings on your guitar i ve been playing guitar for years and lately i ve been wanting some slinkier strings so i can get a little more bend out of them i thought i d try these out and i loved them after playing with these for a week i loved the way that they played and i loved the way they sound so i ordered more packs of these the extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely won t find a better set of strings for the money weak sounding and break very easily i would not recommend these to anyone other than those who literally have no callus developed i just cant get enough sustain out of the high e for my taste tried them on epi lp and a prs i m no eric clapton and i dont use amp heads nor do i employ guys to work on my guitars but thats my impression just not enough umph
397	for the price i got a little more than expected the sound is pretty great the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound other than that your can change amount of distortion its cheap and maybe it doesn t have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot but for the price this is one hell of a deal quality item only complaints are its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something but thats expected and not that big of a deal if you re careful now the one issue i really have with this pedal its cosmetic so its not worth starring this review but it did get to me the knobs they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures they are black plastic ones they look sorta bland and not as cool but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet still a great product though i usually use fender picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while i was playing and it was very irratating so i picked these up i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand the star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it hands down the best pick i ve used i own all versions of this pedal and cherish them if you need more control with eq this pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket more versatile than the sovereign the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well it delivers massive fuzz plus sustain for that purpose it s excellent both in sound and construction it feels like a metal brick however be warned if you re looking for a standard distortion pedal this is not it it s a fuzz pedal it delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal like say a boss ds if a great fuzz pedal is what you want this is a superb choice and so far as i know the best one for its price if the price is still too much for you consider the modtone fuzzer which is about as good but substantially cheaper at least as i write this
398	great sounding strings you can hear the difference once it is used i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance i am both a bass player and a fidelity freak always fussing over tone settings this tiny amp packs big sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard and even my bass the cd input has no controls but is a very useful feature just the same having behringer mics and a ub mixer i banked on this being a good amp and was not disappointed the band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument no watt amp will compete with live drums or outdoor settings and do not expect instruments to sound perfect together but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds this amp will impress you every musician should have one of these around money well spent i am an acoustic guitar addict with five six string and one twelve i play every day and in a year s time i go through a lot of strings over the years i have come to favor the phosphor bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument for a long time i believed that brands of them were interchangeable so i bought whatever was available at the best price no more these d addarios are the sweetest easiest to play and not that this is the most important variable to me the longest lasting of any of the phosphor bronze strings i have used there is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened martins gibsons ghs adamas and elixirs as well as other varieties of d addario strings i think it s time to sell them off these exp s are superior to them all i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong to play as well as i am able i require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up sound wise i look for a blend of brightness and warmth on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar these d addarios do both things and do them well other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the slickness of these strings i simple did not experience that at all as with all guitar strings they should be wiped with a dry lint free cloth after each and every playing not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable i bought sets and plan to use them all both mediums and lights for my stringed friends i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back this just fix perfectly i don t expected nothing better this is just right glad i chose to purchase this cable it s a nice little amp for practice it lacks volume and low end for performance i have used it for several months with no problems while i haven t used a lot of capos in my playing i have used or different types and this is easily the best of that batch while all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar this one was pretty easy to dial in i had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuning the action of the grip and release mechanism is easy but it delivers firm pressure to the strings in fact the only negative i found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chords overall this is a very good capo and i can recommend it without hesitation yes i bought and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass very easy to install on the wall it s solid built maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise manufacture said it s for practice to me it serves the purpose received promptly and tested out with acoustic electric guitar the sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances the treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine the small amp is just what i was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus i haven t tried it yet since i can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a inch rca plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time really great quality item it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up it s durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
399	this is the second one i buy and i love it is small fast and accurate best of all you don t need to have the volume knob open for tuning i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive but it feel quality and does it job perfectly my friend love it above all the other gift it is a everyday use tool for a musician i bought this pedal years ago and like most guitarists who buy new gear i fell victim to confirmation bias regarding the reviews i gave to my musician friends upfront the pedal sounds great in the store if you demo this pedal you ll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer but over time you ll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself turn any of the knobs past and you ll get some undesirable nasal hissy tinny frequencies that require compression noise gating and eq to tame the top boost does provide what it advertises but if the pedal itself is already dimebagged and you engage the top boost it just sounds weird and unmusical electro harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer but i think they overstepped their bounds with this one where is this pedal now in my collection sold for cash after deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a boss me multi effects to simplify my gigging setup i figured as nice as it is to have an analog distortion like the metal muff it would never compete with the digital distortion onboard the me boy was i wrong after getting the me i did an a b test and the me took home the gold easily this came at no surprise considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds what would i recommend you purchase that depends if you re in a metal band and you re recording an ep no pedal in my opinion comes close to fully cranked tube amp distortion however if your amp doesn t have a good distortion channel or capability then a more conservative and affordable boss ds for a more musical metal tone the reality is most manufacturers have great distortion pedals so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone since no two distortions sound the same personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff the noise gate and mid scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a top boost the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob which can dramatically shape the overall sound like the title says ive been using these for years used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with i either use the s or the s and detune them i own all versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them this one is my favorite turn on and go i think it s better than the sovereign
400	tried d adario ej extra light string set on my eko ranger xii string acoustic and the ej light string set on my takamine no trouble stringing or tuning either set with the light weight strings i tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension and they still sound fine good acoustic but a rather strong metalic sound with a nice ring and notably more metalic than the ej phosphor bronze strings sound does deaden over time as expected but i especially noticed deadening on the high e and b non wound strings losing some of their ring tried elixir s for better longevity but they did not sound as good to me as these d adario s great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars soft touch easy care can t beat it i use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar it works perfectly super stable and doesnt take up much space for the price i don t think it can be beat pretty cool gadget a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles cans or sprays and does on a set of old strings
401	hey it s a fun little toy but i ve seen this thing going in most places for an even which is ridiculous i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust i ve made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it s not one of those tools you ll use every song unless you re so amazing you can make it work every song learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun but once you get it and you re over it you wonder why you wasted on something that shouldn t have cost more than it s essentially a v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light this was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when i had nothing better to use my money on my cry baby is about years old and is the oldest pedal on my board i have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the potentiometer to give the wah a broader range but it really doesn t sound any better this pedal covers the white room by cream tone perfectly i gave it stars because it hasn t been maintenance free the pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives i probably should give it this was so inexpensive i couldn t pass it up i needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactly folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag i just toss it in my gig bag and i m always ready i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isn t my thing i played it all but weeks until i got bored and stopped it now sits on my amp collecting dust i pick it up occasionally but i always end up putting it back down shortly after i am sorry i just can t dig it edit so apparently a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post normally i d just laugh at these no lifers but i am sick of getting constant e mails from internet tough guys so i d like to formally state that this is not a bad product it can be fun but the effects it gives are not worth and its build quality is not worth like i said in the original post i became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed the last time i picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout active pickups on my schecter its not that i didn t know how to use it like one of the morons in the comments section stated this product requires very little skill to use read the manual if you are having trouble it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this device would i recommend it if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it if not your money is best spent elsewhere i m a seasoned player of almost years i have owed a dollar martin soprano uke which i had to sell in a time of need for rent money i ve been sad ever since i m in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play i just got this uke today now aesthetically this uke isn t as pleasing as say a martin sorpano but it sounds amazing for the price nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too i have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation this ukes sound is at least as good as a dollar uke seriously impressed i see they make a mahogany version i think du which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone i may get one in the future its only bucks on here amazing anyway this uke is bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated too i see some people complaining about the strings and how it goes out of tune fast when i got my martin soprano which wasn t cheap it did the same thing best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long time anyway this diamond head du soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists excellent would recommend this brand to anyone
402	these are made solid and are very stable i knocked it to stars because they don t match up the holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky i bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin they had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback well surprise surprise surprise it didn t feedback and it sounds great i would recommend this product this microphone works well for our needs i purchased refurbished so when i received the microphone the mic piece is actually removed from the handle it could be from shipping i re attached the item and added a windscreen now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore it is lighter than most fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy speakers the material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging times a week for years i ve owned a nice at recently i ve wanted to be able to double mic vocals for vocal doubling ambiance chorus effect etc but didn t have the cash for another at or similar after searching the net extensively i kept seeing the mxl rated very highly and decided to take the plunge and figured i ll just return it if it s not any good wow i can t hear any discernible difference when simultaneously recording the at on the left channel and the mxl on the right channel they both sound great and i think the mxl even looks better and feels just as solid as the at a definite keeper it s great that advancements in design and engineering are producing high quality products for the masses at rock bottom prices who says you can t afford the good stuff these days keep it up technology gurus pros price point good clean audio quality when working changeable mesh ballscons limited upper frequency response khz one stopped working after about half an hour of use it was not dropped or abused in any way requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than feet this is a well made table top stand the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease i would get this stand again
403	this is the godzilla of volume pedals it is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it it appears to be indestructible i like that it has a tuner output and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver when a friend offered to sell his for bucks i bought it without hesitation i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results if you need light maybe keep looking if you don t mind the heft you will be pleased apparently one can never have too many guitars and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access very stable the auto locking heads rock folds up pretty compact for travel the optional carry bag is a must imho would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice it is a little stiff feeling compared to the others i have purchased but overall it is very nice tis makes it a little awkward to carry overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show
404	mics are like pants you have to find the right fit this one i like for my vocals live i sing fairly low and airy works great for me also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live very sweet sound i prefer it to the seems a bit more bright and natural might purchase another one eventually i decided to try these open metal finger picks when i could no longer find propicks which i really like propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal they offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger i find these and the propicks for that matter much more natural than conventional picks these actually have some advantages over the old propicks you get three finger picks rather than two and because the metal is a heavy gauge they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers it would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they re protected in the guitar case however they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free ranging around in the case highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar pricey as far as strings go a lot of people swear by them but i get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less i ve tried every standard pick even bone silver really expensive ones these little dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite and they re cheap great on guitar and also awesome on mandolin they are small which takes getting used to though play with the round side for a fat tone play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone
405	there good mics should have kept this i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r big mistake miss it on smaller projects and my mxl sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks he thinks it great too i m not sure what else to say the picks work well and they don t wear out easily i like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they don t slide out this pack rocks they have on off buton the quality feels sturdy and i had it next to shure mics that cost more but sound the same for karaoke vocals i bough two other sets and ft cables this isn t the best power supply available it doesn t truly isolate each input the description says the outputs are isolated but what this means is that they are independent that is if one input has a short in it that one will cease to function and not the other working inputs so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not this can cause some issues with noise but there are other things that can cause noise too it s not always just the power supply making the noise it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors a power conditioner will sometimes help as well however the joyo provides plenty of power enough for v inputs and each of v and v it is dependable solidly built comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards i have x pedals on my board with of these joyo units and my board is about x there is some noise but i don t attribute that just to the power supply it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down i m not sure it can ever be completely eliminated but the joyo itself seems to produce very little and it s a third to half the price of the truly isolated units and a definite step up from a daisy chain it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off i got this yesterday and everything was alright except that two of the three mics worked one was dead i tested all three of them with the same and different cable and made sure that the the on off switch was on it was first mic i tested of the three and the dead one of the three everything was good except for that one microphone works well for my needs it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well a good buy i would recommend it for light to moderate use this small device has amazing quality the built in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand held mono recorders mic gain controls boost volume but add some noise like reviews state but when used on low gain record quite well audio in records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer i used a behringer u for amazingly clear recordings several types of sdhc cards work well and have not found a card that did not work with this device even nimh v batteries can power this although alkaline v last longer con the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully surprised really for the price i dont think i could have done better nice case come with stand adapters and make me sound pretty good and i cant really sing dropped one a few times and its still working good feel weight on off switches on each i record to daw and the recordings sound fine i usually run everything through a bbe so that might be part of why i am pleased with them but i do recocmmend these for mics in this price range these don t sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other sm s and beta s in a band situation but that actually wasn t the purpose of these microphones the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system at which they excel the facility we use these at the mics have a habit of walking away or escaping maybe stolen perhaps they sound great through the ceiling they have on off switches and they re cheap we can just buy another box of in a few months when we re down to again seems like they ll last forever too bad they keep wandering off on us pros solid build quality included flight case mic clips and adapters female threads to male threads clean audio great for live sound eventscons limited upper frequency response this is to be expected in almost all dynamic mics podcasting on a bit of a budget setup i wanted good sound quality nice warm tones these mics deliver in a world where i didn t quite have the cash for condensers i wanted i needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word these sound great for under was fantastic i am glad i didn t break budget here i m using these with the behringer fx mixer i am so extremely happy with them this passive di box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input some notes on this box are that the db attenuation still has some attenuation the db attenuation sounded funny but that is probably because i used the same equipment for all attenuation settings with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops all the devices that i tried this with did not have their own internal grounding so i needed to have the ground come from the mixer i did get some hum when i would touch the case just like i did with other di boxes this product worked very well for my needs it works well i mean it doesn t crumble apart or anything i use a fender so its not as much of a worry but i have had one and seen other les pauls fall over sideways or get bumped into they then fall and break the headstock that s why i don t use them anymore i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast verbal audio recordings the sound quality is very good from these mics in fact its hard to distinguish the difference on non pro mixers from other higher end mics they feel good in your hand nice build quality and if you put a windscreen on them there is very little pop sensitivity is good and i m very pleased by this purchase i d definitely recommend these for any kind of audio recording they may even be a good option for instrument recording given the lower price tag note once you put the pop screens on they no longer fit into the carry case you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine there doesn t seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last they do what they re supposed to do i have purchased and used many various types of guitar string winders and i must admit that the planet waves pro winder is the very best i have used to date it is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings pull pegs etc it is sturdy and should last many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement because of the affordable price on amazon i will be buying some for my friends as christmas stocking stuffers the planet waves pro winder is well worth the cost and i recommend it to anyone also with the string winder i also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping free shipping which promised that the items would be shipped within to days the items were ordered on the thursday and received on the saturday three short days treat yourself thank you amazon a great deal here on amazon these cost a lot more a few years ago it appears chief bought raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing the shelf i received has slots all over it instead of a bunch of screw holes this makes it really easy to mount things i m ordering more of these they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets good luck and good music to all i have four snarks and one other brand the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display tuning is quick and simple i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough i m sure glad that i bought these straps there not leather but are put together very well i plan on using them as backups in the studio the price was just right cam quickly and i d buy them again i m used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck occassionally there are problems with this set up then i saw these no more bendable problems i really love these extensions despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely these are lasers you can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace i haven t tested the sound feature but i ve seen it on videos i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained got this because i thought the length would be enough it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length had no problems with this cable though works great order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring i didn t think that these mikes would give me the quality sound i needed for the price i paid
406	i was surprised when i tested this microphone it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors that was expected though this system works great i have a taylor ce and two other guitars i use these on very simple and works great i almost always play finger style without a pick but on the occasion i need a pick i like these easier to strum sounds good to me if you re doing a lot of picking out individual strings you ll probably want something thicker but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good plus pick out a few strings here and there when i first learned guitar my buddies kept telling me i d want a capo but i held out until just recently the dunlop is secure doesn t scratch the guitar at all and holds the strings down as it should instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning i can use this to achieve the tone i want good item for the price i own several taylor acoustics and a few other kinds of guitars i bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity too dry these are so easy to use and can be recharged if you feel like for is too much every couple of months i ve successfully recharged these using distilled water about times now and they work just as great as they did new these also come in a resealable package so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar case you can tell when they ve dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling it means they need to be replaced to recharge them i take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid big enough to hold quart and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom next i take a smaller empty ziplock container the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich and float it on the water in the larger container then place the packs in the floating container stacked on one another or on their sides and seal the top of the larger container with a lid it traps the humidity in the container and the membrane on these packs is two way so they absorb it until they reach capacity again works like a champ i only have four pedals on it thus far but i haven te had any problems no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldn t handle the load i still have open leads for those other pedals smile my power strip now has more space for other toys to make my weak playing sound better this set of strings is fantastic i ve been playing for over ten years now and have tried everything from elixirs to d addario to martin to john pearse you see where i m going with this and many more i have to say that for the money these strings are in a class of their own when i first started playing i loved the coated strings i wouldn t buy anything but elixirs for years then i got married and money became tight and for a pop a set elixirs wasn t looking as good as they used to so i tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball amazing they are not coated but after a while i got used to that and now actually prefer non coated strings these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought and the medium light set is just perfect nice size high e string so i don t feel like i m going to snap it when i do a pull off and good bass response all in all a fantastic set of strings that you can t afford not to try and at why wouldn t you give them a shot once you get the hang of this capo it s wonderful it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension i have several guitars but the one that i love using this capo on has a hard v neck it s pretty accurate on that neck up to the th fret nice product worth the investment now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it if you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new martin guitar this is a must have product i didn t want to have a hole drilled in a new martin guitar so this worked fine wit the martin leather straps actually i bought two of them it is a star product it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand it is very solid and will last a long time can t believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old pin connector i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector this is now a boat anchor to buy a meter cable from them they charge for the cable to ship it and then tax the extortion here is almost monster cable like these folks should be embarassed very good quality cable and plugs easy to make custom length cables from inches to ft my pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that i actually made room for more because there was no extra wire to get in the way let me start off by saying i have had several types of humidifiers all of which have worked well the major upside to this humidifier is you do not have to worry about over humidifing your guitar packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use one star short of a star review why the price for the replacement packets other than that a wonderful system
407	well that s overstating it a little but several people told me i wouldn t like fw strings on my bass i wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound smoother and more mellow i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar so i put these on my musicman sting ray bass i only have a little peavey practice amp which may account for how bright these still sound but i love them i have to dial the active eq treble control all the way down this is just a bright sounding bass but i wanted more of a stand up doghouse bass sound like early basses had i have a low level hofner violin bass also with fws on it it shipped with rws what were they thinking but i loves me my musicman and i love the sound of these strings oddly a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut but it doesn t seem to affect the sound as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy and they will pop but then again this is an awesome bass made during leo s time with mm but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good lack of a good amp and not knowing how long they ll last is why i gave them stars otherwise star all the way these fender locking tuners are the best for stratocaster guitars mainly if you have a tremolo system what helps a lot the tuning stability and speeds up the strings change i ve been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while but i was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i ve been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller i was intrigued by the promise of long life though i have a taylor big baby that i bought used and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didn t sound at all like old strings this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new i d just changed the strings on my s gibson gospel a week ago so i decided that would be my reference the nanowebs went on my s guild d both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars the gospel is a bit brighter sounding but i m pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars if they d sounded dull i d notice as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled light gauge they had a e string something you d be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings the b was a compared to the of the d addarios i usually play the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges turns out that these are hd light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end the difference shouldn t be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d so how do they sound the unwound e and b don t sound different from any other plain steel string of course the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer when i switch between the d and the gospel sound wise i d say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day i wouldn t call them dull by any stretch of the imagination if i didn t know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn t be able to tell from playing them so they re good sounding strings and they last a long time that leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings here s the way i see it if you re a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not you re probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination but if you re a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run and if you re a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice for myself i m going to leave these on the d for as long as they still sound good i ll update this review when i find out just how long they do last follow up after playing these for a few days i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars they sound great on the loar and now i have two guitars to do a long term test on this is not a pick for windmilling guitarists this is a pick for the precision player it s really small noticeably smaller than the red jazz iii picks with large fingers like mine it almost disappears but the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it it s a very stiff pick with just enough give to keep from sawing your strings off the picks are first rate based on my previous experience with dunlop picks this pack will last me for years i m inclined to lose a few along the way just so i can give dunlop some repeat business
408	the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners i have found i have both the the sn and sn for my guitar and mandolin respectively when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on if not sure which get the sn red one it generally will work for all instruments this pick is well designed for mandolin playing unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners it s also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing best ukulele strings i have found to date and i ve been playing stringed instruments and uku s for quite a while now i like em excellent mother s little helper highly recommend this item it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument a must in my years of playing the guitar i have settled on d addario as my string of choice when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy i m really glad i did the tone is great they re durable and smooth on the fingers even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell like tone that mandolinists are after they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock i have a high end washburn f style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good this is the pack to get thanks d addario for providing an awesome product the strings definitely have a good tone though i ve got them on a low end mandolin they may be more than the mando needs but they sound great this is a very nice product to use i would recommend it to anyone it is small enough to be out of the way while playing very good rosin and does exactly what is described a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows no need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity
409	so i just got this product haven t used it package looks ok strings are pakced in one plastic bagi can t wait to try this one i ve also bought martin m ghs silk and steel will come back with results the strings on my new yamaha fg s were too hard and noisy so i ordered these and what a difference in the feel playing went from painful to pure pleasure i did notice that the tone of the low e string was a bit dead especially in drop d tuning so i put that one yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows for that i gave four stars instead of five no strings i ve tried are like this it doesn t have a strong character but work together with your guitar my seagull now sound mellow with brightness also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it
410	at first i thought this would be a gimmick but it was cheap so i figured what the hell once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was when performing live i always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic once i got this little guy though i just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear it also protected my mic in a fall once too can find anything better for this cheap i was looking for a small high quality monitor for use in the praise band at church i needed to run my boss gt and vocals through it on stage this little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume it is built extremely well very solid and sounds incredible the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing i still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and i do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor there is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom but i place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my di box underneath it between this and my gt i have the ultimate direct guitar system with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board simply fantastic piece of equipment this is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest the height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle the seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne i apologize but that is my best reference for comparison assembling is simple and fast i had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances i managed to get it done with no problems another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists the foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals however this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture i used this with drums but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bit the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport it s not a deal breaker on the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes i previously used a fender acoustasonic jr and i got tired of lugging it about lbs and all of my other gig equipment around with the cm i can get it lbs mic stands music stand mic and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip a big plus i like the sound quality i get my guitar is an acoustic alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a shure sm the roland doesn t have a huge amount of volume but if you re looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport set up and take down this is a good choice if i used it a with a passive guitar pick up i d want external preamp think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room i m also thinking i will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my acoustasonic jr it looks really rugged so i m looking forward to years of happy use
411	i bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars imagine my profound disappointment really boss this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the top control higher than about o clock at first i thought i must have a defective unit but then i started reading reviews on line seems like it is part of the design it s too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones hidden beneath a wall of fizz totally unusable as far as i m concerned by the way i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat didn t purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review i wasn t expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good is it a completely authentic acoustic sound i d have to say not exactly but it s kind of close and it s a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master which still sounds distinctly electric so far the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the jumbo setting again don t expect to sound completely acoustic it s a nice way to at least approach that sound check out some youtube tests before buying it s okay on my blues jr nos but really shines on my crate td which is a brighter amp and less colored i zero the spring verb and use the pedal s onboard reverb for best results used it with my strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a duncan hotrod set sounds good with both guitars especially neck and center positions pedal is solid be advised that it comes with the volt from the factory so if you use a dc power source then you ll want to remove the battery to do so you ll see a black knob at the base of the pedal just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery overally solid pedal as you d expect from boss a word of warning not sure if it s my setup but when the ac is in my effects chain not a loop but in front of the blues jr i started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning burnt tube or the like when i run it alone to my crate i haven t experienced this could be any number of things in my effects chain so check if others experience this i m wondering if a small cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp not sure how a non piezo pickup would affect the tone anyone know about this very beatiful and good quality nothing bad to say it s a fender strap with the hard rock leather look highly recommended the boss ac is a serviceable acoustic simulator i am the only guitarist and in my playing environment children s church and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric the ac does that job although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful played through a carefully eq d amp you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings there is an audible hiss less noticeable plugged direct into pa noticeable plugged into a good clean tube amp out of control with humbuckers or solid states the key to using this pedal is using it correctly first and foremost use single coils tested with a les paul with burstbucker pro s the hiss was overwhelming played with an american deluxe strat with n noiseless pups in the rd position it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel point two any form of gain will create a ton of hiss point three tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps tested through a frontman and vox pathfinder vs an orange tiny terror and fender hrd the ac is not a set it and forget it pedal based on the volume of the amp and the room you re in you will need to tweek the eq to find that tone i ve read that you can use an eq pedal to get the same tones i haven t found that to be the case if your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch or in my case as the only guitar player to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly this is a great fit stars for ever present hiss for actually sounding like an acoustic when it s eq d correctly summaryacoustic sounds ok but noisy in weird ways i returned it price seems high for what it is and vs alternatives in the marketplace pros boss case is metal mechanical design is durable standard v power and the power jack is on the back where it belongs variety of acoustic sounds possible personally i only thought of them sounded realistic at all though cons fizzy noise integrated with notes played or chords generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain while i have several boss pedals i think they always make the knobs too small and the font print too small i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing details the basic concept is good i had an ac prior model and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note it wasn t in between the notes or when not playing it was integrated with the sound of every note you played or chord and you could not filter it it was also just noisy in the pedal chain adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some however i sold that model because i didn t want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn t happy with the sound at the time the ac s were selling for about new boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac i bought the ac hoping they had improved the issues of the ac and they did a little but not enough to keep it i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues just not as pronounced i think the ac could work for gigging but there are other choices that sound as good for instead of to with tax and or shipping so to me the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead they make two a and a the has reverb on the pedal i opted for the and got it for i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case however this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy or or behringers for the price of a boss if it breaks i ll just buy another i also have a boss gt multi effects unit you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that out of the behringer or out of the boss ac the least cost effective of those choices is the ac and it has noise issues the other two don t have i m not saying its a bad pedal i m just saying it wasn t the best choice for me when considering the cost the sounds and my usage model if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i m using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect this boss pedal just didn t work that well for me
412	is this guraunteed for life or something it should be for the price it is very basic tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up i would not buy another one at the prices they charge but then i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to the carry bag is very nice the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between if you look at the picture there appears to room for pedals but is all you will get i have a boss rx double pedal looper and other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables i needed a footswitch for a variety of applications to include an acoustic amp guitar amps and other guitar audio gear built like a tank and completely configurable well done again roland i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac acoustic amp the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy however you do have to use a volt batter to make it operate this is totally unnecessary for a foot switch the worst part is the leads on the battery connector volt were not properly soldered or had shorted out the only way i could get it to function was to let the volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed i e all that has to work are two switches and a battery you would think that boss would put out a better product i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site there is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these i have several came in perfect working condition great buy i put this puppy on in minutes or less they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster they work like a charm if you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat this are a no brainier the price is right and they look great on your stratocaster works well very well constructed would it kill ya to add an on off switch so that the batteries don t run down other than that it s perfect nice wide lip sturdy appears to be well made and durable nice finish on it hopefully will last a long time
413	could be more tapered for such a tiny pick but the material is awesome nice grip even more so when i sweat these pick have a permanent fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material it wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone in fact i found it increases speed these are perfect for a fast paced style of picking the tone is bright and snappy good quality material ensures i won t be needing another set for a long time d arrario does sell some fine strings while these are not my very very favorites strictly because i prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings they still do just fine much better than some other brands i ve tried i would not hesitate to buy them again good sounding and playing all around strings i have moved on to the carbon fiber and mm lexan jazz iii picks but these ultex picks are also very nice they are a little less bright than the carbon fiber picks which in some cases is actually preferrable in my opinion at least at the moment the jazz iii picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy once you get used to the small size there is no going back the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator this gator case is very good i m use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one all tuners like this are going to be a little jumpy none of them are perfect this does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it the korg pitchblack was a little out of my price range so the ga is working perfect for now overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand five stars these are shred picks they are very accurate pinch harmonics come easily the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze i gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them i d bought this thing several years ago forget where as an alternative to the electro harmonics stone phaser the eh stone is great but a couldn t afford it the adapter input is proprietary differnt than was on my boss pedal board wasn t gigging out so i figured what the heck i ve had fun with it with a wah and a proper guitar sound one can easily emulate the hendrixish univibe sound remeber guitar touch pickups signal etc all play into that factor also its a vintage style not a mid s mosquito tone killing device not a huge range here no swooshing jet sounds just good ol wobble i ll agree with the other guy here and say the durability is questionable and the size of the thing is annoying by comparison to the standard pedal housing and it does make some noise in my chain lately have been trying different cables adapters and batteries a tinkerer hobbyist modder may enjoy getting a sturdy pedal housing box and putting this things guts into it and getting a sturdy switch paint it all weird and call it a boutique pedal if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller easy to install these buttons on the guitar well made and just what i was looking for thank you very much a very nice pick both in feel and texture the design is a bit boring though only complaint is that it s fairly small about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a cent piece but that s okay i got this the same time as i got a set of dava jazz grip red picks and the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks and i think i like the dava picks the best all three are tight grip picks and all the same size they re all good though i d rate this one next best and the jazz iii carbon fiber next after that great product with a little soldering knowledge really basic in fact you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all nice and snug with my american stage cables d addario is great hey r ford uses them great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these believe it or not i ve been putting off buying one i m so glad i got it now i love looking at my guitar in this thing and now i even want to pick the guitar up more than ever id have to say im happy with the quality can t see anything to complain about really
414	i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed i had to make some adjustments on the neck of my martin d and remove the bridge pickup this left the saddle too low to the neck i researched the tusq products and found enough people impressed to give it a try i m pleased to say i find more ring through the body and a better sustain i ll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps this has an output of milli amps for electronics the voltage has to be correct but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter when i purchased this i d seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar guess what as far as i can tell there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with this is not worth the money
415	i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq i did have to sand to make it fit that may sound badm but i am glad because it s better than too small i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering this capo looks great and does the job it does take a bit of pressure to open the camp but its better then the winding versions i bought these because i needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board i have the planet waves patch cords called so i thought these would cover it being when i went to hook up they were still too short so i immediately blamed these cords ooooops took out the tape measure so i could complain and found that these are indeed i then measured the planet waves and found they were actually not my bad these seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are if you want to spice up your board go for some color if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button these are great buttons to use it comes with two buttons two washers and screws two different sizes this is a great product just not for me i found it brightened my tone way too much and i went back to plastic gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end brilliant solution to the strap button problem the pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won t slip off works as well as locking strap buttons did for me these screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older epiphone by gibson s that i opted to add a pick guard too the screws fit everything perfectly the look of the screws was even better than the cheap one you find on most import and low end made guitars the have the fat heads and strip really easy i will purchase again for my next build the martin msp sp phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings medium are very good strings that are just below strings like elixer s except they are much much less expensive having recently purchased an epiphone el i went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to graph tech s tusq material it is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with the top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the tusq bridge and pins the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional this was one of the best modifications i have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade i can barely wait i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice clayton s rule been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else long lasting and great tone besides awesome yes indeed khjghjjh hgkjhgk
416	got to admit i was a little intimidated by the installation process when i was shopping for this pickup but when i got the box i was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions not too long not too short along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly the jig method is super easy and provided great results i was really excited to try out the pickup so i plugged it into my roland ac and let her rip it was awsome very full and very representative of my guitars sound k k you have a convert in me i am now thinking about trying this on my martin i am finally feedback free i use this on my taylor with a k k pure pickup system i play mostly in a church worship team and am usually right in front of a monitor this blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole i don t get a huge loss of tone but a little bit i will take that over having to worry about moving around and getting feedback like crazy highly recommend i have k k pickups in other guitars this is the first one i ve bought that had the smaller transducers it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers like other k k pickups it sounds darned good with a decent pa head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking the pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack this one comes with an ingenious diy installation jig made from i m not kidding cardboard golf tees and double sided tape it makes placement a snap the best pickup is still an external mic but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer you can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup i wouldn t consider this a backup mic i would consider this a professional vocal mic period this is a great mic out of the box it has a nice weight to it it sounds slightly hotter than say a shure sm which is why i like it so much i typically like to stand back from a mic when i sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well seriously i don t work for the company or have any ties whatsoever i m just a dude in a band trust me on this one perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone s pedal board many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting the ditto is great for practice though installed one on my cf martin almost leaving a thumb super glued to the inside of the guitar an interesting experience would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar i m sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar bought another for my brand new taylor gs mini mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the cf martin through a brand new kustom sienna pro acoustic guitar amp from amazon i ve read that folks prefer the k k over the made for the gs mini taylor pickup get it disapointed the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound it sound muffled i will have to replace it soon these strings last and they moderated some of the booming i get from other strings i use the exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads it works well of the time but sometimes has a problem with the g string for me i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together they re fail safe the snark tuner will also get buggy once in a while but together it s so statistically unlikely that i don t worry about it the stomp tuner also has the benefit of being able to hault the signal hence why i wouldn t just use a snark tuner
417	this is my third circuit breaker cable i play in church and no one wants to here the pop if i have to leave the sanctuary why three foot foot and foot depending on the setup for the group i hate cable jump rope i really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand i use the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion it does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but i d keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner if you value your guitar not a specific knock on the hercules but most low and portable stands like this are the same they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down you may be careful around it but it s hard to say for others nearby for a cheap guitar i wouldn t mind using this but for a more expensive guitar no thanks please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly i ll be honest here i bought this one primarily because of its looks not a lot of white clip on tuners around i also own an sn and in comparing the two the sn seems to be as tight but it s only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the sn which has more features for a few dollars less than what you re paying for the sn still it s a typical snark it registers very quickly it s easy to read and you don t have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration the stem on mine is a little looser than i would prefer but it still stays in position my only real gripe isn t unique to this model but to all snarks the curved stem combined with the round head means it won t sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren t exactly robust so i m always concerned that one day i m going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces other than that i d recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner
418	i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband this product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the port the product specs does not show or say plug port my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one the support people at behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo sounds like bs to me the problem i had and the reason i bought this is that i tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a adapter chord it works but the levels are too low when i received this i was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are but not by much it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional i d say the level is beginner intro level sound and quality i bought a like new product describing faded or damaged packaging when it arrived the pkg box was dented i don t care and product looked new inside but all the instructions described a blue usb light and cd of driver and recording software which this did not come with behringer gave me a link to download i assure you it s crapware and beware for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use rock out i acknowledge that this is a minority opinion perhaps i just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards but while i loved the sound and functionality of this wah wah pedal it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable i suspected that the potentiameter was shot so i had that replaced but the same problems reoccurred like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it good product but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit i had it works but expect some flaws first finding a driver to use was a pain it doesn t come with a software disc so look on behringer s support site for driver download whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio you can t run any other media player and get sound my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this get something else
419	i mean you paid for a pedal that if you want to buy from the boss it s about times this price and if you want it behringer it s about twice this price it does what is supposed to and it doesn t have a cheap look for home and garage entertainment is good enough i was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand but now that i know that i like it i m going to buy the distortion red one i m only sad they don t make a noise gate or something similar that would be the top of the deal sturdy strong good quality cable for guitar especially like the fit with the right angle plug would purchase again if need bd works fine good value i had no problems at all getting a brand new poly pro strap on these even if it was too snug it wouldn t have been hard to work a strap on to these i don t know why people are saying bad things about this product if your dealing with guitars there much harder things to do with guitars than getting a snug leather strap onto the locks don t listen to the whiners these are what they need to be so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors guitar sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use i use this footer between my guitar pedals and amp i do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new i was initially concerned when i first received the cable that it would not last the cable is not as fat as i had hoped however the ends are solid and sturdily built i usually use mogami gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so if that long this hosa cable is a very good cable and i even chose to use hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals they last like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you highly recommend to everyone who play guitar genius concept it works for me perfectly i no longer lose or misplace my picks easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in it ll depend on where you decide to place this pickholder i placed mine right above the jack plug works great and to me its cheap cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable highly recomended if you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list with the price of volt batteries you can t afford not to purchase this rig if you need it there s enough wiring to have space between your pedals but the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board a great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the volt adapter the volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position i am revising my previous review on the l s i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks i loved them so much at first that i ordered other sets and restrung several of my other strats and other guitars big mistake why am i so impatient these were unbelievable right out of the box bring my strat to life giving it an unbelievable feel and sound but with every positive there s usually a negative and wait for it wait for it yup there was i changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my strat and noticed all three smaller strings g b e were all flat on the fret side they were already worn out i suspected something as the sound had changed already too becoming flat after only about a week this is not mu only guitar i now have total and rotate playing so i bet i hadn t played the strat for more than hours or so now i m so disappointed i m going to step up to the s then the if i have to i love the sound but don t want to change strings every week to make a long story short i wouldn t buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings if you need a well made cable in a short length i wouldn t hesitate to recommend these buy one now feet is a weird length for a cable it really only has one use when you re sitting right next to your practice amp just don t wander too far off this cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his her guitar lesson and has to plug in i bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between i feel chained to my workstation just my experience get a foot and be free hope it helps these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice not the best pedal out there but for the price it s pretty freakin awesome love the second looper and the ability to turn wah on and off by depressing the volume pedal all the way forward solid sounds and cabinets d arrario does sell some fine strings while these are not my very very favorites strictly because i prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings they still do just fine much better than some other brands i ve tried i would not hesitate to buy them again good sounding and playing all around strings a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item if you are a truly music chosen one awe it might have deserved stars had it had a chance to prove itself but i did buy another that i still have but it is still in it s original packaging as a back up for my other cords until i break it out and use it hard for months i have nothing else to say here this is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back at full price of it is a solid deal any lower and it is a steal leather straps are a little tricky to buy online you can t feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing and every piece of leather is different most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for this one appears to be an exception to that rule but if you are looking for buttery soft fine corinthian leather with gold stitching you need to understand that you ll have to pay more if you want one made from wild buffalo leather or free range mastodon hide you ll need to hitch a ride in the tardis if all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won t let you down this is a safe bet oh and tight strap button holes that s a good thing in my universe as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel on this planet anyhow i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back this just fix perfectly i don t expected nothing better this is just right glad i chose to purchase this cable i did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these i just got done stringing them and they sound great i think these will be what i play from now on these picks are a good change of pace they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers good investment for the price this is a very well made guitar stand it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time i bought this stand for my sons first guitar but i may have to order myself one as well for the price this stand just can t be bet sounds ok on its own not very loud or good quality at any high volume but then when you plug in some good headphones awesome great gain tone high volume sounds awesome perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect great sound awesome deal score d i don t travel often with my guitars but needed good protection for those times when i do this product meets all my expectations my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment the corners of the case are well reinforced the hardware is mid grade i believe it will hold up well for my use and for someone playing weekend gigs overall it is a bargain for the price in fact i don t think this hosa gtr r cord lasted hours one step on the cord and it came apart this purchase is the very reason why i m looking to buy a wireless system maybe if you re using this to run a pa i would recommend it but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn t recommend this item but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer you ll end up saving money over the long haul works well and has good sound i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds the interface could be easier to use but for this price point one can t really complain i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy but it has the star for grip and that is super hard not to like get some nice polish cleaner really works very well on the finishes i have cheap glossy chinese electrics and a matte finish acoustic handy to have when your changing strings to clean that nasty fretboard wow do those things get dirty pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue lasts a long time or squirts will do an entire guitar this is great for adding pedals you cant go wrong for this item with the price even more so thank you been using it for a month or now had absolutely no problems good constructio looks good angled end is a good fit price is good
420	ordered a set of these to put on my ibanez and on my squier they fit perfectly highly recommended they are grovers they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock i like the vintage look of these and they go great with my gibson custom sg i have grovers on all but of my guitars to me the stock speaker that came with my fender blues deluxe reissue sounded too brittle even if i messed with the presence and eq knobs it just always accentuated the highs too much for me i had read reviews on this speaker and decided to pull the trigger and get one i haven t regretted the purchase i was hoping the improvement would be the same as when i put a ragin cagin in my fender super champ xd wasn t the case it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for my blues deluxe now sounds warmer to me and doesn t have that accentuated high end that it did before all in all it was a good upgrade and i d do it again slick i installed these on my ish epiphone les paul they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look i can tune with much finer precision and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending the ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better i should note that i had to drill new holes or more precisely enlarge the holes on my guitar i used a drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully i m sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary but it was actually quite easy now they are in there nice and snug since i made the holes a bit tight
421	the description says it all but i was still wondering if i made the right choice because i was comparing the fender accessories guitar tools what the heck kind of name is that anyway with no reviews to thejim dunlop nc formula neck cradle maintenance stationthat had some pretty good reviews well i cannot speak for the dunlop but i can say that this kit is light weight self contained has storage space in it and it works if the guitar is face up or face down it also has pad to keep your guitar from sliding and the pad keeps the neck rest in place so it does not topple over i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc on top of it i think the neck rest pad inguitar setup maintenance instructional guitar dvd with denny rauenis this one turned over so the fender logo is not showing i got this for christmas last year as a beginner learning guitar this is a must have works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadn t had to replace the battery s yet and i tune my guitar every time i play well worth it its so easy to use my son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in europe during ww i needless to say i did not want to pass this on to him yet i figured he could start simpler i read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument it has a great tone its construction is solid i am sure this will give him years of entertainment this is not a toy a great addition to your mouth harp collection i installed these on my ish epiphone les paul they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look i can tune with much finer precision and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending the ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better i should note that i had to drill new holes or more precisely enlarge the holes on my guitar i used a drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully i m sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary but it was actually quite easy now they are in there nice and snug since i made the holes a bit tight
422	this is a really cheap microphone i m usually amazed how good cheap mics sound e g the shure pg line is fantastic but i m not amazed by this mic it sounds like a cheap mic it handles high sound pressure ok but sounds tinny and is more prone to feedback than a nicer mic for the price however you should not expect any better likes price this is essentially a toy stand and cable too dislikes sound quality maybe you want a lo fi sound you could make it work overall this is a really good bargain for an extra back up or kids mic it is not a horrible mic it is usable for applications like speaking for hi fi music recording however you ll notice it is a cheap mic i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good i haven t had much chance to play it but so far so good it seems like it is good quality i always like to carry extra cable when performing you don t know when one of the one you have breaks and you don t have extras what do you do then it works and it s great to have extra the apogee jam works great and it sounds great the operation is very simple you plug in your guitar and plug in to your mac or ios device i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band if there is any latency i can t hear it it works beautifully apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception i was able to plug in a microphone line level into this as well and record my vocals likewise it worked well with my string bass as well i was able to record a whole song in no time for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable although this is hardly a high end microphone it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument although the output signal seems like it could be stronger the stand is sturdy too so this is probably not the best choice for the full time professional musician but for busking around or playing in clubs it s worth a look this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements i connect it to my portable watt amp and provides the sound i need in intimate settings the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality this is not a great quality microphone but that s not what i was expecting when i paid for the mic and stand i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school i need some less expensive equipment to play on so it works well for that
423	these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand they do need v phanom power from your board or a mic amp i m using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which i will review in more detail later the vdc comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which i will review as a set if you do stereo recording you can t go wrong with these their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear it sounds great and setup outside with db of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away rain drops comming down and sounds you never would hear note never get these wet you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain you will need xlr cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar but you already know that gls audio ft mic cable is very high quality you will not be disappointed low cost long lasting i m very satisfied i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal the kick mic s base is beginning to fall apart but i have used these things on the road all this brutal summer and the sound is still the same i have other more expensive mics but often use these in clubs as a backup when the drummer doesn t have a favorite or bring his own kick mic while it cannot stand up to say my favorite the d it does the job and the overheads are the easiest o h mics i have tried yet the tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece except for the kick mic mounting bracket after months of use i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics update now that i have been using them for a while i can say they are reliable durable and sound good my akg drum mic kit sees more action than the pyle s but the pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs mic ing the kick drum mic s mount is falling off but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians they are in great shape these mics have more life left and i have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables this are a great value for your buck the only thing i didn t like about these the cable ties suck haha if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you
424	second time buying the pack great deal for the price i love having the colored cables makes set up so easy i also like the xlr connectors on these haven t had one go bad yet the absolute best guitar stand made strong and durable i bought one about months ago and just ordered a second hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands this passive di box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input some notes on this box are that the db attenuation still has some attenuation the db attenuation sounded funny but that is probably because i used the same equipment for all attenuation settings with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops all the devices that i tried this with did not have their own internal grounding so i needed to have the ground come from the mixer i did get some hum when i would touch the case just like i did with other di boxes this product worked very well for my needs fits just fine i have two electric guitars and one bass nothing can take it down you will see it recommended i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help where the stand shines if micing amps some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease i own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them i use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage the ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very slinky i e not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices sounds great looks great the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight even fixed another bands vox mic connector his sure cable was loose in the connector this cable was tight has worked on sm nady starpower akg s mxl marshall and mark bass amps and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the xlr s and on the numerous mixers and yes color rules picked up this set of cords for a gig i had at a large hotel event there were audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages we had channels running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board the video mix board and then the house mix board i had returns a e for my subwoofer monitor mixes and a stereo main mix i used a different color cable for each function i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards all of the cables worked perfectly the video mix guy asked me where i got the cables from so he could get a set for himself these cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear down already had sets so i ordered one more set for my studio so i can find connections that much easier great set of cables not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no name japanese knock off i play mostly hard rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech metal and prog rock for solo projects where i m playing pretty fast and sometimes hard they also handle de tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like dadaad they are clear with good sustain good stand solid components easily adjustable and the boom is good length i gave it too our drummer and he uses regularly without complaint
425	ok so i had to buy another item because items in my cart were add on items i needed another microphone and i had been toying with the idea of purchasing a gls mic i m extremely happy i took the chance and as soon as i submit this review i m purchasing another this is the best price value purchase i ve made in a long time i m not going to insult your intelligence and say it s the same as the other well known mic that looks the same but for my ears and everybody else who s listened to this mic it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my sm i just used it to play a show on friday the th and it performed wonderfully the sound guy thought it was an sm i will definitely buy a couple of the es s as well to mic up some amps now things may change in a year if the mic doesn t hold up but it is hefty and solid and seems to be built like a tank now if i was dripping money maybe i would stick with the industry standard but when you can buy these at a dollar ratio why on earth should i update i must say that in some venues you ll really have to tweak the eq in order to stop feedback so while they are a great value they feedback in some situations where my sennheisers do not but they were times the price a very strong capo too strong for bigger instruments but works good on ukes and mandolins and banjos with not too thick of a neck i have several of these capos one for each instrument not onlh are these good for the price but they have become my new fave i switch acoustic strings times a month on my main guitars i gig times a month these last long without compromising the tone great price too i tried every brand until i got to these not sure why i did not try them earlier probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide this thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top i had a lpb that sucked tone and sounded like crap but i really need a line boost and didn t want to spend a lot for one this little baby at about o clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs these bags are large i didn t realize they would hold large tripod stands my other bags were a lot smaller and sometimes the tripods would stick out the top it would have been nice if there was two pockets so two tripods wouldn t touch each other but this still works great love the on and off switch and the sound is great with little or no feedback would purchase this mic again is the the best pedal ever not even close does it do exactly what you want a simple slap back echo reverb to do absolutely i almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound it can give you a decently wet surf ish sound or a fast delay rockabilly sound it s not super versatile but if you re looking for a little depth and color for under then this is what you need i mean come on it works it s cheap and it doesn t take up much room on your pedal board
426	i m not a big fan of planet waves because they ruined the dare strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack so much more efficient than a floor monitor i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips and because there is more than one channel i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics definitely recommend hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space i ve used these at every gig i have run sound at for months and so far they have passed the test with flying colors they allow me to concentrate on other more important things than the reliability of my cables it s a good quality case i wouldn t check it as luggage when flying but it s small so bring it as a carry on it ll protect your mando just fine this little guy worked just as advertised it s a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont feel like bringing it it won t work the best for getting intonation right but it hits regular tuning perfectly super easy to use and a must have for anybody who gigs out
427	let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of dano stomp boxes i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make this pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs but imho the tremolo from dano s cool cat line is a much more durable pedal for only more at the time of this review the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link i don t think it s true bypass either the cool cat has a metal enclosure true bypass sturdier inputs and knobs and a much better on off switch the features and sound are the same spend the extra and you will have a much more bullet proof pedal with the cool cat trem i didn t expect this cable to be so thin it s easily the thickness of any guitar cable i ve used not sure about long term durability or signal loss interference if i had the foresight i d spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable still it works and was inexpensive edit months later and it s dead already wire frayed at the right angle jack you get what you pay for i have an esp guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when i got the guitar after buying a line pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear cables etc i originally put it on my wish list because i will admit you don t always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise my guitar fits perfectly it used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut as mentioned the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close but this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag and the pockets oh the pockets they fit all of my gear i have my guitar cable a set of full size sennheiser headphones a line pocket pod all the allen wrenches a tuner and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets and there is room for more if i need it the bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn t stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won t bother anyone and it s fine after a day or two one last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock i did not know this but wow i had no idea how useful that could be i tend to carry my guitar in bag up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful then you have the backpack handles as an option as well i really cannot recommend this bag enough i do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like but i don t really care the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that and while the padding is great i would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel it would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage in case you want it for that kind of thing i don t travel long distances with my guitar but if i did i would use a hard case only for that as i have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear i bought this recently for to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades for it s an awesome deal but objectively when compared to an epiphone style case i bought last year for it s deserving of stars which isn t bad just not great pros decent build quality four buckles one locking and three hinges very nice plush lining not heavy knobs on bottom so it stands on end knobs on side and back so it s never directly on the floor fits a dreadnaught well cons not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut the one locking buckle wouldn t stop anyone the big front and back body panels flex more than they should exterior covering feels somewhat cheap the handle is hard plastic and not padded so for it s a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard but it doesn t measure up to a basic epi case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes it also had a strong chemical odor but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away
428	this is a star stand considering the price sure it s not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what it s supposed to do without any problems i don t forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough it s a music stand so i don t see how it would take a lot of abuse i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner this thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it doesn t suck any of your tone i haven t used the battery pack so don t know about battery life i use a one spot plug to power it another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on it s very heavy and seems sturdy and well built the display is a little confusing at first but once i read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use like many guitar players i have a few effects pedals of different brands and i needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them at one of the guitar forums i frequent i started a thread about powering a ts tube screamer with a non proprietary nine volt power supply one spot came back twice in the replies since that time i acquired a two more pedals so now i really needed something i looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me i got creative i ordered a one spot combo pack then bought some wide industrial strength velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard shell brief case so far so good after two months of band practices the one spot v dc adapter with the multi plug daisy chain cable does what i bought it for my little four pedal setup works beautifully i m perfectly happy it the one spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source the combo pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the multi plug daisy chain if you are thinking about buying this product do it if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals here is a compatibility chart power to the pedals rock on one spot has become the standard it is not cheap but it is well made and useful with this you get the power adapter the extension cable to hook up multiple stomp boxes and a bag full of converter cables the power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet so far i have used it successfully only to power two pedals so i cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board but i am sure it would do so without issue as i have seen other do it without a complaint so i recently purchased the visual sound one spot combo pack and i must say i am quite pleased i was checking out some of the higher end products t rex fuel tank voodoo lab pedal power and just didn t feel like forking over the money maybe one day if i m going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around i ll go for one of the other products but from what i read on the visual one power supply i was willing to take a risk especially for the great price currently i m powering hardwire pedals a dunlop wah pedal and the berhinger cs see i m cheap sometimes but effectively so so i m already using of the power supply cables all pedals are powered without issue without noise there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect whatsoever i can t say enough how excited i was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board i just put together and when it came through and worked flawlessly it was all the better i would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals or even a moderate or novice player it s simply a reliable and affordable way to power your pedal board thumbs up and stars rock on this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together using just one wall wart you can power all of them at least those that receive this kind of power v where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l converter cl for line products i have an m audio black box which had a peculiar size plug it was v ma but nothing would fit then i tried the l converter and bingo i m in business and black box bliss i would recommend having it around just for that it costs about the same as odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can t find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters a pedal junkies salvation i bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar i have a sabine tuner with a mini mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps i d rather not go through this tuner is compact and works well i clip it onto whatever guitar i pick up for a quick tune acoustic or electric push the power button and off i go i haven t fooled with the other features metronome detuning so i can t comment about them an added comment i broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended my fault but it shouldn t have broken so easily i m sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit stronger thicker or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely this seems like a good product it is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great too long is better than too short this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly good little connector cable well constructed durable built to last i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes worth it if you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list with the price of volt batteries you can t afford not to purchase this rig if you need it there s enough wiring to have space between your pedals but the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board a great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the volt adapter the volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position i have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig but not enough power for pedals this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for dc distribution a i have tried many picks in my years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best i have been using dunlop for the most recent years but these are the best the carbon fiber of these dunlop jazz iii make them as long lasting as you want when playing rock slides and picking they are better than any other material and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz their grip is excellent and they feel awesome gotta try them highly recommended cheers up until a few years ago i had been using the same old brand i d been buying for years then i tried this recipe dunlop it is wonderful it does everything the product description tells you about excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal i use it to clean not only the body but the tuning heads and bridge on my bass guitar no nasty residue build up over time it cleans and polishes just like it was designed to do without streaking and so on you ll like this stuff better than anything you ve used to date or at least i think so i sure do i don t get any hum and it powers what i need it to a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power on the plus side it does the job powers your v pedals and doesn t break the bank on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy best to have a noise gate handy just in case ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure i ve been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome they cost no more than the strings i normally get but the tone and feel is totally different i can t comment on how long they ll last or keep in tune but for now i m impressed i ll probably keep using these on my santana prs for awhile since i like the sound every once in awhile i ll step outside of my box i mean i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them i use d addario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics except for my strat i like fender bullets on it so the sample from the vine sorta of nudged me and i m the better for it i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good i have world tour bags to keep my axes safe nice padding nice features this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie it hears things i don t and tells me whether they are what i want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together if you like being in tune this is probably for you it is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything you can clamp it on a cat s tail but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don t even think about doing that you sicko great design easy to read works better than other brand tuners i own only bummer is you can t carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one if it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about dollars oh well i suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool hip out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity oh the peer pressure this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing that s why it s so inexpensive what you see in the picture is what you get but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge it was incredibly easy to install and the sustain is improved one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge the springs in the back keep it back the string tension keeps it balanced in the front what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim it s definitely the best verb it s price range you can dial in some pretty lush tones it has a way toggle that changes it from hall spring and room verbs there d is also an a b switch that is almost a tone mode a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb also has a blend knob which controls wet and dry signal mix and time knob that controls you guessed it reverb time and amount very versatile this pedal is built with great construction though the first one i received was faulty all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on the nd one works flawlessly seems very durable switch and jacks are quality i highly recommend getting a spot or v adapter b c this thing drains batter power fast though all modulation pedals do this pedal does not suck tone and is true bypass though i wish this wasn t as i wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned off for lt shipped i certainly can t complain if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it i ve been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now this pedal completed that task it s hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect very punchy and crisp you can t go wrong with behringer pedals they are plastic though so they might not hold up under heavy road use but for home studios they are perfect highly recommended great pedall for the money it makes ur pedalls real quaiet it does what its soupose to german mind great electronics well made but plastic this is now powering my entire effects board and it s doing a great job it easily connects to a variety of different pedals with the adapters included and there s just enough wire to power everything without cluttering anything up with nests of extra wires the value is excellent for anyone on a budget or who is tired of full power strips cluttering up their setup i d recommend this to any musician who uses multiple effects instrument devices these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles i bought a set of s and s and i also have some d addario s the s are super slinky just like the name says they re great for quick movement around the fret board my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding i play a lot of rock and sometimes these just don t pack a punch like the s or s do all in all though these are great strings and i will definitely continue to buy ernie ball i ll probably opt for s or s though i ve had a few of these things not all the same model this one was hard to read i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible my complaint like other reviews i read is that the end doesn t seem to fit snug on some connections for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal the boss pedals however were hit or miss can t say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose anyway for the money i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable it s a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp have a twin reverb fender tube ya get one hell of a hum it s so bad i just can t use it at all i m not sure about a transistor amp but who uses those sometime round my friend kendal built several of these for our band they were great and incredibly handy i havent investigated this but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not certainly if he did he never patented it or anything anyway flash forward years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes resenting batteries and individual power supplies i thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again and so i did this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters so far it has lived up to my expectations i cat speak to playing out with this yet as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose so for such a simple device you really cant beat it unless you dont really use boxes personally i presently have my wah distortion chorus overdrive delay slap echo and flanger running through it everything works great enjoy this was perfect i am very happy with the hosa cfs inch right angle fx pedal cable pack i was new to pedal effects new to pedal boards and new to the challenge of how to power it all i did my research and settled on pedal train for the board the mini with case and the one spot for power this bundle including an pedal chain a few adapters and the power supply does it all in fact it may be overkill i only have pedals so i have to hide secure the rest of the chain with twist ties and the adapters never used em but it is a complete kit if you need more than this i don t know what to tell ya to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much i use light or medium regular size picks for strumming i really like the fit feel of this plucking pick smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings you might balk at the price but i do not regret it in the least some nice picking with this pick i don t play a lot so i figured ought to last me quite a while i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too but the dunlop is better to me the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain everything needed came with the combo making it ready to go right out of the box i have this hooked up to pedals so far and it s awesome real cost saver on batteries you really cant go wrong for the price i have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers including a few of the vox valvetronix series however this is both my first fender amp as well as my first true tube amp first some clarification is needed on tube vs modeling amp the fender super champ x is absolutely a tube amp it has one ax and two v s and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages however the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone which is what allows it to project different voices contrary to what some posters have written channel does also have some front end modeling except that the the model is fixed for blackface tone and controlled by a separate volume know no gain control channel offers different voice presets and of these model a variety of vintage fender amplifiers including the tweed deluxe bassman deluxe princeton and twin settings model a variety of other popular amps including the vox ac and marshall overall i found the available tones to be excellent unlike my valvetronix where i more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times i could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars one thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently you may have to adjust volume gain bass and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp however i found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component also the x does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or hissing you hear with digital modeling amps the tones that come out of the speaker of the super champ x are very rich and touch responsive as you d expect from a tube amp the amp has tons of high end sparkle but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume true of many amps the stock speaker which is fender s own design and has a ceramic magnet i believe is frequently criticized as a weak point however it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps or only intend on playing at bedroom levels you re unlikely to take issue with it the eminence ragin cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end but again the amp is plenty loud and full sounding for its size better intended for home studio use than most gigs but it excels at what it does that brings us to the effects section and the fender fuse software that works with the amp via usb cable frankly i m not a fan of most on board effects with combo amplifiers i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrive distortion the good new is that the on board reverbs which include spring room hall and a few others if you install them from the software are quite good you can also reassign the presets to different effects so if you want a flanger with a reverb you can have a setting for that if you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb you can do that too the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects but as i said while they represent a good value for players that don t want to invest in pedals i m more likely to use my boss dd than the on board delay and so on the build quality of the super champ x is largely excellent the grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of fender s more expensive amps the amp weighs in at pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top one thing i did note however is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting so i will have to be careful about that also there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better but overall the amp looks very well constructed i was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic but everything is mapped to vintage looking knobs and from a few feet back the amp looks just as much at home in the s as it does post overall i think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that i hope to enjoy for years to come i m only really scratching the surface of its potential but it makes great fender tone sound easy the fender fuse software could be a little more intuitive to work with and i wish there were a better way to know what each of the voice and f x settings correspond to without consulting a chart but it s a great little amplifier that s all the power you d need for hobbyists and studio recording and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well this amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single inch speaker it sounds great right out of the box the overdrive channels amp models are some of the best i ve heard from modelers pedals etc not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and i havent even looked at the fuse software yet i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes if you mic up this will work for small gigs the build seems very good i don t think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price this is just what i needed to get rid of three or four large ac adapters great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board i have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviews i already have an mxr line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp this serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run replacing that with the ep booster did not have a significant impact on my tone yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster if at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal i didn t find it magical though because i ve always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different i am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos i keep all my guitars in my room and i had to many stands cluttering it up the screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that i got are holding guitars to the wall on drywall nonetheless so given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem they all are sturdy enough and i have always been suspect of wall hangers best deal and does the job
429	i got this to install it on a podium it is perfect the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place get it if you need one i had fairly low expectation for a pedal but many people said it sounded very close if not better than a vintage boss vb considering i didn t want to spend x this pedal i can t compare the but can say it works very well it can do subtle low rate low depth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles the rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control or at least turning it up weakens the effect which i guess is good i might swap around the leads finally a non blue led is used which means it won t blind you when you try to adjust the settings being however the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even behringer s pedal and the hinge is a little less stable it will still hold up with moderate use however it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature which is a momentary mode comparisons i have compared side by side the following pedals fulltone mini deja vibe dunlop univibe discontinued stainless steel model dunlop roto vibe voodoo labs micro vibe bbe soul bender as well as comparing to some different beasts in the modulation family an mxr phase mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato and behringer time machine summary just the factsa great pedal and my favorite uni vibe of all doesn t take a lot of space up standard power supply good visibility on control knob settings does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise this is the only pedal in the univibe group i can say that about and it s why it s almost certainly going to be the one i keep might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others still need to play with it a little more overall i love this pedal at under bucks only downsides i see are the led does not flash the speed rate and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to toe tweak with my right foot quality seems ok but time will tell on durability pros smallish form factor although slightly larger than a boss pedal doesn t take much more room than a standard pedal standard power supply v center negative and jack on top back for easy access not in the way for patch cables on sides switchable between chorus univibe and vibrato controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking easy to see best pro is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass mids or lows it just applies the uni vibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone this is the only pedal i tested that i can say that about and most of the others cost times what this one cost led is red visible and not a weird bright laser to my retina the price at about bucks is a great deal quality of construction metal case decent knobs pots and switches no complaints so far cons led does not flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right for toe tweaking i have just had this a day so can t tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound not sure about that and i will update this review as i get time to test further but it sounds great to me overall highly recommended if you want a univibe and don t want to do a lot of comparison shopping i have done it for you some users report quality issues here i guess time will tell on that mine works fine so far and for you could buy and still save money over most other options available notes on other pedals i compared fulltone mini deja vibe highest quality construction as expected at the large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking very useful on a vibe pedal my complaint is that this vibe colors my tone it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass this probably helps the sound stand out in a mix however i d rather that my vibe not provide eq because when i switch it on or off i don t want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back my sound i was able to match exactly an authentic original uni vibe sound with some adjusting it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also i have a love hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it some days i hate it but i like the build quality and the speed control i originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn t strip the treble off my tone until i realized the mids were boosted the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag and at shouldn t be mxr dunlop m new in at about the new m uni vibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like it is second place on my list on pure sound i might even like it slightly better than the jimi and that s saying something it s the perfect form factor shape size with no significant coloration of the tone other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode the m gives the jimi a good run and if you are extremely tight on board space it might be a better choice for you they sound very similar the m has a wider range of adjustment on speed depth than the jimi but i m not sure the extra range is useful mxr jim dunlop mxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty i really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface it is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other mxr s use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as i d have to leave it with the mini switch engaged and the red led burning all the time looking like it is on when i was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch it was also a tight fit this pedal has a level knob which i m usually a fan of but i don t see the need for it on this effect i didn t care for the white main led much and of course the power supply location the led on this does pulse the speed but was annoying due to the white led that s a subjective thing i suppose all said this is a great sounding option with that perfect mxr size so a good choice but still x the cost of the jimi i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value dunlop uni vibe uv cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard to see settings placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best non standard v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick sound was very good but did also color my eq sound by boosting the bass and muffling the mids and highs slightly on the one hand this sound matched a lot of recorded uni vibe sounds i ve heard on the other hand once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix the seller had a day return policy days so i returned it and they lost the sale othewise i would still be thinking about this one i was on the fence about whether it was my winner i was able to match a true uni vibe sample but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me at i d have to love it to keep it voodoo labs micro vibe liked the form factor the simple controls high visibility knobs ability to toe tweak controls standard v power supply and placement of all jacks can get a very lush even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted and mids highs are cut the eq effect just kills the pedal for me its going back not my pick at bbe soul bender my least favorite vibe it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass in a band mix i m pretty sure it would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led it was the first vibe i bought and i only compared to fulltone and dunlop before returning it had some useable sounds but with the intensity above had an annoying womp womp womp of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion with intensity below it was usable kind of but a tone muffler i returned this one early dunlop roto vibe a good choice perhaps the only choice if you must have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment didn t color the tone much and that was a problem on most other uni vibes tested limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me intensity range seemed less than other pedals too large footprint if mounted on board but also offers the ability to take no space on the board by not mounting it i didn t like that when you switch the effect on you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in std power supply a plus led indicators good and flash the speed durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots overpriced to x in my opinion other general modulation effects univibes are effectively a phase effect without the swooshy space age edge on the sound you can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too space age sounding vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni vibe and i d recommend the behringer vibrato at if you like vibrato sounds uni vibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting didn t care for the behringer time machine my gear used for testing fender american deluxe stratocaster mesa mini rectifier amplifier mesa rectifier x cabinet with celestion v s pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies a note on vendor selectioni had a very bad experience with the vendor i bought my mxr dunlop m from and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product i provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page i recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal or anything else you be careful to avoid the amazon marketplace vendor called mixdspnet in san jose ca in addition to charging a restocking fee if you want to return the pedal in original condition with all materials and packaging getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with amazon to get any meaningful response once they did communicate they were very unprofessional further when the product was shipped back signature required as recommended by amazon they were not available or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product it remains unrefunded despite their confirmation that i could return the item for an refund i expect i ll need to work further with amazon in the end to get this resolved a google earth view of their addressed explained it all mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex most amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not at least when it comes to returns also while they sell a few dunlop mxr guitar pedals looking at their site reveals it s not their primary business they seem to sell a bunch of other non musical widgets my recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for to days as most large musical instrument retailers do should you need it they have a few hundred positive transactions so maybe can be ok but i can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction i ve ever had shopping on amazon doa no good out of the box plug it nothing no way to send it back i m not from the states meaning i just wasted away something bucks add shipping i did bought a behringer pedal before tremolo pan with good results but i guess there s two sides to this particular low economy pedals well i ll man up and buy something else this pedal is well made plastic but w great electronics made designed by german mind it sounds like a chorus and vibrate at once wave tone and quiet w true bypass on bord great pedal for the money get it its worth it for guitar bass or keys
430	i got this pedal recently all in all it s a pretty nice device expecially for the price seems solid and well made it has a nice big pedal for big feet it works smoothly i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal my only gripe is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal v battery or a v plug in power supply why the difference the really bad part for me is that i bought this to install in a newly purchased behringer pedal board which comes with a v power supply so in order for me to use this pedal in the board i will have to run two different power supplies or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard s power supply behringer this was not thought out very well i m now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle bottom line the pedal itself is great but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you one final note about behringer they seem to get bad marks now and then i really don t understand why i have two behringer amps two of their stomp boxes the above mentioned pedal board and the volume pedal just discussed i really like all of them i have never had any problem with any of these items they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price behringer s full range of products is so extensive that i see little reason to buy any other brand i m sticking with them amazing the besti can t believe this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words i recommend it thanks behringer behringer may be cheap but they do create some good products for this one it s a hit and miss although i ordered three of them behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer it is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting i ve had more expensive pedals over the last years of playing but it s hard to beat the price features and quality of the behringer pedals these pins are amazing one u never have to worry about breaking them they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain very cool i got this because at just around bucks its pretty much seemed like a stealcompared to other pedals i was looking at but a few notes if you buy this definitely have buy a v adapter with a polarity also know that when people said that little blue light was blinding well they weren t kidding i ve put a little paper and tape over mine as well however it isn t sticking it might not have the best effects or effect strength but as my amp has no built in effects its better than nothing if you re cheap like me but want effects this is decent although the chorus effect seems particularly weak
431	i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality thank u guys i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them i use a power snake instead of batteries so i cannot comment on battery life or compartment access the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence i ordered this pedal based on the previous reviews but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust i do a have a few behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one i won t be keeping to me it wasn t even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs i probably got the wrong gauge these things have no give at all due to the thickness but i like the small size they are about half the size of a standard pick so they are very easy to control i wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since i have mostly behringer products and am more than satisfied with my other pedals decided to try the co again i am more than satisfied a chorus isn t something you use all the time so i expect this one to give me years of good behringer reliability and service for someone looking for that extra color in your sound try this pedal i think you ll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can t beat the price a great value for your money
432	i ve been playing for about years most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga my performance guitar is a martin hd and my practice guitar is a blueridge br i wanted a third guitar just for kicks i d been looking a taylors but didn t want to spend that much money enter the seagull s a fellow picker asked if i d ever heard of a seagull i hadn t he said they were nice guitars and i ought to check them out so i did a little research i first read all the nice reviews here for the s and then went on youtube and listened to a few my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s and i really like it i choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft and i understand that the spruce has more volume i got the s today and this evening my wife with her taylor gs mini and i with this s played smokey mountain memories nice real nice guitar i found that the action on this s is pretty good out of the box i m going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time if he can make the action better i ll let him i m also going to put on some elixir light strings i don t know what kind of strings are on it out of the box but the bottom line is that i am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this seagull coastline spruce s acoustic guitar right out of the box i m glad i bought it so stiff nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle if you sing and use effects pedals for an instrument and can t rely on a good boom microphone stand being at every venue get one of these and throw it in with your gear d addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars and now my two mandolins consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand i purchased a set of fender vintage tremelo tension springs in order to beef up the tremelo tension on an inexpensive squier jagmaster guitar that i recently purchased these springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the jagmaster the loop actually goes all the way around which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar and it seems that they are of a higher tension highly recommended as replacement springs or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars i heard great things about the s and so being a novice without any idea of what to buy i bought it based upon reviews i ve played it for a year and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars here are my humble thoughts the seagull is comparatively unattractive its snake head headstock with the tiny not great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar the cedar top is very nice looking and the rosewood fretboard bridge on mine are very nice the laminate sides back seem much thicker than competing guitars and this makes the guitar heavier and to me less alive resonant during playing the satin finished cedar top is very easy to marr the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force but at a heavy strum the top seems to bottom out and lose definition the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok the binding is a sharp degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing something i ve not encountered before i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle nice all in all it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it s made in canada for asian mexican prices that said just because it comes from canada doesn t embody it with mystical vibes in fact for the price range i can get a just as good asian mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back front sitka spruce solid top wood better tuners and a more attractive headstock with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good i don t regret getting it but i feel like i overpaid for what i received and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade s exchange rates i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price seagull to me is over hyped thanks for reading i personally think this seagull is over rated a lot of reviewers are covering the muddy not crisp sound as mellow i don t think so i have over guitars in my collection and around of them are acoustics i have nothing against seagull or canada but bought one of these new off the rave reviews and just recently i have had both thes and fgx for five years pulled the s out for another try just because i could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used yamaha it did side by side i went through the chords on each guitar and had to finally come to the conclusion that the seagull had to go with a price tag of for the s and for it s yamaha equal the fg s unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away i would stay away from this guitar and look elsewhere oh by the way i have an s for sale this is a fun pick i play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought i d give this a try its great i love the tone of this pick striking strings i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings more organic than plastic picks yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard i think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you ll be fine its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument worth a try
433	let me begin with a public service announcement if you want to buy other ezdrummer expansion packs you need to buy this product first important update toontrack is scheduling the public release of ez drummer in may if you buy ez drummer from now until then you will also get the download for bear in mind ezd is a completely new different program from ezd and so i would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock ezd pop rock kit which has some very kit pieces in addition to the ezd default kit which is more reminiscent of the rock expansion kit from what i ve seen ez drummer also gives you the ability to mix mash kit pieces from all expansions and so to me this makes ez drummer a must buy based on the sheer customization available resume normal programming if you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit ezdrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you ll find it s very easy to use very easy to program and overall a well made product you might be tempted to compare ezdrummer to its bigger and better brother superior drummer made by the same company superior drummer is superior to ezdrummer but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close to life sounding virtual instrument there are ways to improve the off the shelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately youtube has plenty of video tutorials on this but what you want to do is open up your digital audio workstation pro tools cubase etc and set ezdrummer for multi track output from there you ll be able to tweak the different outputs ezdrummer has as if you were in a studio and had mics at your disposal most high end professional studios use about mics to capture everything on a drum kit and so virtual mics is nothing to scoff at kick drum snare top and bottom toms cymbals overhead and room once you have each of those outputs running you can perform individual eqs to change the tone dramatically adding a touch of distortion gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound really close to life in reality once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced it only takes a trained ear to tell that it s a virtual kit as far as the expansions go if you are looking to record a particular style of music then i highly recommend buying the ezx kit that goes with that genre the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above but only for rock as for me personally i did my best to eq and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone but in the end i found the rock kit lacking especially since it s a tight kit toms cymbals hi hat snare kick product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies the db pull in each direction for each of the seven bands are filter worthy my only dissatisfaction lies in the amount of noise this unit adds to my chain when engaged when inactive this unit is transparent no tone suckage when this unit is engaged each frequency band carves the sounds nicely however consideration to have this unit modified to reduce its noisy output has begun for me at least i am thankful for the internet and the opportunities it presents for me to mod this pedal
434	it works really well and it s really thin it s thinner than i thought the price it s about right i needed only of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this behringer perfect pedalboardi can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb from costa rica i recommend it thanks behringer i bought this harmonica for our son the music enthusiast he loves it it seems to be manufactured well as it is substantive in weight and seems to be solidly built only time will tell but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks couldn t pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price our son says it s easy to use and has a good sound quality hey if it makes our son happy so be it highly recommend singing and playing menas you dont get to bend down and pick up that pick you just dropped i loved this holder its small enough to fit in your pocket and when you go on stage just throw it on the mic stand loved it but i forgot it at a gig thats the down side of it being so small easy to lose but it is awesome i ve always liked behringer products there prices are pretty reasonable and the quality cant be beat i just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one don t let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you this is an awesome pedal ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound it is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don t abuse it to much it should be fine you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price buy this
435	i bought of these for live recording of my band they adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding i recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage features stable base good extension easy hand grip to lock unlock for adjusting for me it was a good perchase expect less for that price excellent fine manufacturing good finish perfect for my line wt it works well at all heights i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment they are well made reliable and cost effective the xlr connectors are secure and i couldn t purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light i use this to patch in four ports from abbe di channel active direct box direct injection di boxand two from analesis mic tube duo stereo tube microphone preamplifierinto a mixer first the size is perfect in my rack configuration the cables easily reach and the color coding makes it a snap to see at a glance what is connected to what that is a great improvement over tags and labels that require you to get close to read what makes these a bargain is construction the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages however it s the attention to small construction details that i love the xlr ends are quality components but cheap ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly another factor is the strain reliefs at each end those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them overall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent set up and teardown and is built to last if you are shopping for patch cables in this size these are a great value in my opinion because you will probably not have to replace them for years
436	having to send the first snark sn back but the replacement thus far has been flawless i made a slight adjustment to my guitar s truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on a couple tips to tuning a guitar tune it like you play it if you strum play softly then pluck tune each string softly however most people don t play softly so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes they pluck each string and wait like seconds till the ringing fades out so they are generally tuning each string as it begins softly resonating so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat to tune your guitar correctly you really ought to pluck each string hard like every seconds and tune it that way rather than waiting for the sound to fade out if you do it this way you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you re strumming the living daylight out of it also please check your intonation your th frets should be in tune same as your open strings you pluck your open string hard tune as described above then you check intonation by pressing very lightly with just the tip of your finger and don t touch any other part of the neck on the same string but th fret and both should be in tune the exact same if they are off th open then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment please don t pay someone to setup your guitar you can do it yourself so easily go on u toob and search scott grove tuning your guitar wrong and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over guitars he spends almost an hour explaining all the details also watch his video on how to setup adjust intonation truss rod action etc btw if you can t get your snark to tune your guitar hint it s not the tuner s fault the first saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down then your next strings d a e should also look like another staircase going down if not break out your philips head tweak your intonation it s a stand it does what it s supposed too that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only these are by far some of the better made ones i ve found without a contraption to lock in my instrument and give a false sense of security these are made no where near how they used to be years ago in a negative way but the foam medical piping has gotten better as the old stuff used to scuff and deteriorate really quickly i d prefer a better stand however i question it s existence this levy s leathers inch cotton guitar strap is good looking in an understated sort of way very well made adjustable and extremely comfortable and works exactly as expected we bought this for my son as a starter strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future highly recommended cfh this is a good stand i ve had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before and this one is definitely much sturdier it fits every guitar i ve put in it just fine and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck if you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up this stand was very inexpensive and i thought i could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my epi sheraton ii unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand it seems to be built well enough for what it is but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards also for left right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems tippy the construction itself is ok the rubber tips on the feet seem fine but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short the body cradle is nicely padded but isn t firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design it just isn t all that solid you can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece it ships with an unsightly white upc sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage granted the sheraton ii is a large and heavy guitar but the onstage is billed as heavy duty and to me that means solid which this stand just isn t at least with larger guitars or basses when you use a guitar stand you can t afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood bottom line you get what you pay for for smaller lighter guitars strats and such it may be ok but for dots sheratons s and larger gretch s i just wouldn t trust it and that goes for most basses as well i will need to look for something else i have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is great as a matter of fact i ordered more get this one and have no regrets
437	i think it s good but for wiping down after playing or for buffing after wax on my classical guitar bodies i think i prefer the old flannel cloths instead micro fiber seems to be slicker and generally did not feel that it was doing the job mostly removing finger prints etc maybe it needs to wear out a bit or if it had a thicker nap to it pretty seems to work fine purchased a pack for my playing buddy he loves fender only way to go will order another set soon very happy with service i chose this rating because i found this product superior to other similar products i have purchased in the past a big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass seems sturdy enough i side on safety so i use a soft cloth for extra protection but this item does what it was designed to and should last a long time great feel to them and nice sounding they do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what i normally use i think i will try these in the super slinky study strap great feel leather matches my instrument well width worked well for me compared to the version it is just as described i am happy amazon always comes through without a hitch it was delivered as usual before stated time gives a nice little boost on my blues jr however this is not a replacement for an overdrive pedal in my opinion just more of a boost wish it had a grippy bottom made from rubber vs a smooth bottom made from plastic very nice cable i used this with my planet waves v adapter it works very well all my pedals powered off one adapter is very useful the onespot adapter itself would probably be even better as it only takes one place on a power strip etc instead of a chunky old school adapter like the planet waves style really nice product for the price
438	colors help keep track of what is going into where and the build quality is solid i was warned about the shielding but i haven t experienced an issues yet i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help where the stand shines if micing amps some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease have used them for months with no failures decent quality ends and build there s really nothing else to say about them and i m saying it now to reach the minimum length requirement buy some now incredible quality and value these cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than i expected for the price they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end the dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables and the color coding is a big plus as well not only is the product outstanding but i was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure i was happy with the cable set i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life if you are have problems knowing what and where your systems are terminating theses are a must for you i have mastched them with my microphones and it is easy for controlling and identifying
439	using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet it is holding a shure sm microphone the microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic but i m using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads its the exact same thing as my shure mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material thats fine by me they fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should xlr cables are hard to mess up these are great they do the trick why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap this is a solid cable works very well form i can now walk around more with the extension no more limitations quality is excellent i had purchased this cord and a cord for an assignment i was going on i had previously bought a shorter cord that just didn t fit tight enough into the mic this one and the other one i bought were really a great well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should i would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon these cable are perfect i ve bought much more expensive cable that didn t have the quality of these they even had velcro re useable tape to hold them each
440	i think picks are like well you know a personal choice i bought these cause they are simple inexpensive and will compare to others i have been using these lately would buy again these cables have taken a beating the last few months and have served me well with no problems real metal ends not molded on with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors i picked this simple interface up back in and i can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years it s been gigged dropped and even rained on however it still sounds great and functions perfectly i was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free asio all driver i was able to get anywhere between ms and ms latency under windows it was plug and play with the default wdm driver however to really take advantage of capabilities you ll want to install asio all especially if you re using ableton fl studio energyxt etc all and all the uca is pretty limited however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your pc for the functionality alone it s definitely worth asking price
441	one of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the mxr carbon copy delay pedal designed by way huge founder jeorge tripps is a great analog delay for under using bucket brigade circuitry true bypass and a very simple knob interface the carbon copy is a very flexible unit utilizing the modulation switch you can achieve a slight chorusing sound like the flutter from old tape echoes which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot the unit has a small footprint like most mxr pedals so it is very pedal board friendly this is truly a great sounding delay so try one out holy buckets of tone batman let me start by saying i m always on the quest for great amazing tone i think it ends here this pedal is absolutely remarkable built like a tank i m pretty sure it will out live me its full of sonic options the overdrive has a level tone and overdrive almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an eq which is a total plus in my book it also has a mini toggle for comp cut fm and vintage modes the comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end the fm is really transparent and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange bite yes this may be another tube screamer clone but it s a darn great one the added mosfet circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your low end fattening it up if thats your cup of tea while the standard leaves it more transparent you should know this switch does effect the whole signal not just that of the boost side on to my only negative check on this pedal the boost only works when the od is on it is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive just additional circuitry to add more gain to your od signal another great feature this pedal can be run at different volts from v v running at standard v gets you easier breakup whereas v will get you more headroom this pedal won t be leaving my board probably ever if you re even thinking about it just do it you ll never regret it it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable it has good lenght between two plugs you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals will this replace a pro fret job nah that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth end results
442	i paid only and it is small and convenient i was impressed with the sound at first i played it with my line watt amp i didn t like it cause of the squealing but then i read how you use it and all that boy it worked great i use it with a tascam us usb plugin to my computer and i get a good sound for practice i still like my line amp though for more sounds and sustain but this is a bargain and small you can use this with any usb audio interface if you like ac dc you would like this there are different amp sounds you can get cheap and convenient i am not disappointed my opinion is that it sounds best with a usb guitar audio device such as tascams us works just fine except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels not sure what that s about but i m not very picky and know nothing about guitar stands so maybe it s supposed to my guitar just love it this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be it is all i want or need from a stand what can i say about a guitar strap it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset i would not returned because i don t feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn t do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for i bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar the difference is quite noticeable and good the guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a better than a lot more expensive guitars sound i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder the price seemed high for a little chunk of plastic but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied
443	quick and accurate i also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though if you are like me that you love playing music this is a good buy it pretty much does what it s supposed to so you plug it and it s ready to use it s pretty fast and accurate for it s price light weight the only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the th string overall it s good enough to buy it its pretty delayed and doesn t display the notes for very long but i play in drop g and it gets the job done the construction isn t something i wanna step on but in a bag its better than paying bought this in early march this year have it in line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board no problems with it at all it works as advertised i ve found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my fender g dec amp so what does that tell you not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because i love mine for the money you can t get one that touches it so what if it s not that means you have more green stuff to buy other things since buying this one having it work so well i now own a couple of other behringer pedals great little mixing console for home use and practice i use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where i need to connect my guitar a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit this thing has phantom power just in case you didn t read that already overall i can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you d need and even has a british eq to help shape your sound a bit cons not many one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh you have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off apart from that the led is wayyy too bright so bright that you can t look at the device for very long and obviously can t make out the writing and control labels on the device i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led i recommend getting this unit and only gave it stars because of the few cons listed above for musicians in a budget this is the deal it is not the best but it still does the job not very powerful to read the signal of strings in my acoustic guitar as it does the boss tuner but for electric or bass is fine very accurate too just gettit if u are in a budget oh man am i glad i found this deal no more for strings anymore there the exact same as you would get from the store delivered through usps dont have to go anywhere how cool is that out of stars but of course its ernie ball look at this pedal look at what it does and what it costs for a tuner in a pedal form factor and that s if you don t even try to hunt down a lower price by contrast boss s tu is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing and it costs retail yes the housing is made of plastic i don t know about you but i generally won t be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever it should survive and if it doesn t so what it s cheap to replace the other person on here obviously got a faulty model which happens mine s developed a touchy input jack over time it s actually the earlier tu model but i don t know that it s totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap one star off for these kinds of quality control problems just to be fair i own three other behringer pedals as well and they re still going strong a tuner is an essential part of any musician s rig and this does the job just fine use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing update after having used a new tuning pedal for some time i will admit that yes this is a subpar tuner however i still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay this isn t a bad investment for a guitarist just starting out this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound this is not a gigging pedal you do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig so if you re planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the on a korg however if you re an at home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners this is worth the price it sits right on the pedal board the signal flies through it when it s off so there s no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and drop d and it s as accurate as the korg is it s just also slow it takes a good seconds to register a change which is fine when you re just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren t crucial i just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs i have other behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them i use a power snake instead of batteries so i cannot comment on battery life or compartment access the box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence the boss cs is right for me i have been using it with excellent results i have many compressors line mxr behringer digitech and although i alternate their use the boss stands out on many rig configurations it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product i highly recommended it as your main compressor if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it good luck
444	i like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required but you must be careful i tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge not remo s fault but it is something to pay attention to i sent it back probably due to my ignorance has multiple patterns to collect sound was a clear mike but i didn t detect any body to the sound maybe a preamp would have helped i checked out many mikes and ended up with a rode nt a which is probably similar in character my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars suspicious ratings to me now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out but since i found a good solution i don t think it s worth the effort works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro sounds good amazing for the price good buy can d go wrong in my experience these cables were not great the connectors rattle they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise i can t expect miracles at that price point but i certainly expected better i avoid this brand of cables
445	work awesome easy to use and accurate only issue in tuning drop d or b on a string bass it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it it tends to fall off quickly on low notes microphone works well for acoustic guitars all joking aside these heads really are great tune em right and you ll get a nice warm tone from them that s unmatched with other brands i agree with the others here this joyo is just a plain and simple od just like so many others but at a fraction of the price i put my pedals through three tests playing alone playing at rehearsal and gigs this thing stands up nicely on all three using it with am sp tele hiway strat squier epi lp spec w p and fender bj peavey classic sounds amazing in any combo giggin musician for over years for what its worth when i purchased this pedal from a local music store i wasn t even looking for a double pedal set but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my tama stagestar kit during my quest for a pedal that had the feel i wanted i sat behind a pacific drum kit that had these pedals at first i ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi hat i liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when i decided to see what it was like playing double wow it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset most of the adjustments require a hex wrench which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals the left side slave pedal has a full floorplate and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle i have tried there is a slight lag on the left pedal which is normal for any double pedal configuration but you ll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal before i purchased this particular model i tried out tama s iron cobra pearl s powershifter and a gilbralter avenger i did not like the stiffness of the iron cobra but did like the pearl and gibraltar pedals it finally came down to either this or the gibralter which was slightly smoother but significantly more expensive i opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal if you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration i strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look more importantly try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price features and quality it has to feel right in addition you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi hat which means that you will need to compensate for that i recommend the gibraltar hi hat drop clutch asin b f yy which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi hat with ease i have my hi hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position but stepping on the hi hat pedal using the clutch puts it in full play position tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal
446	it is a string winder what more can i say it works as it should and saves time very useful when restringing a guitar love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great i bought the vox amplug ac and loved it so much it probably doubled or tripled the amount of time i play guitar i loved it so much i went out and got the more expensive by joe satriani signature amplug i liked the satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the ac and delay feature is a lot of fun but i had serious questions about the classic rock amplug why did have only a star review on amazon among the lowest for any of the fabulous amplug products would it be only a one trick pony well i have to tell you i was completely blown away by how great the classic rock amplug is and i m now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews i ve tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier and many pedal users are seeking what they call a marshall in a box in other words they want a effects pedal that will single handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of marshalls believe it or not the vox classic rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a marshall sound as i can imagine and it comes in a small plastic headphone amplifier that runs on aaa batteries and costs all of functionally the classic rock amplug is the same as the ac three dials for gain tone and volume an aux in jack for mp players a headphone jack and an on off switch but that s where the similarities end while the excellent ac model simulates the boxy sparkly sound of a tube amplifier the classic rock packs some punch the low end presence on this thing even through a set of entry level sony headphones from target is significantly greater than on the ac more importantly the sound doesn t deteriorate with higher volumes there are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones but most of them become a static filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume amazingly the tiny amplug has plenty of power on tap and the overdrive is controlled through analog circuitry with amazing clarity but the real surprise in the classic rock amplug and the point upon which i disagree with several other reviewers here are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak or claimed that there were no clean tones yet with both my les paul and a strat i was able to set the volume at around and the gain at about level and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume if any dirt was remaining a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem even better playing a strat into the classic rock with the gain set somewhere between to actually created a tubescreamer like blues tone this tone was one of the audio demos offered on vox s website but i didn t believe it for myself until i plugged the classic rock in and dialed in that tone long story short the classic rock is extremely powerful but more verstaile than i thought it can do the high gain marshall tones i expected but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly overdriven tones it might even be more versatile than the ac amplug though i remain pretty loyal to the ac the good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both highly recommend the classic rock stars i bought this unit for a friend and i could compare with others overdrives i already have i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise
447	what more can you ask for in a pedal that runs you twelve clams and ships for free this is not the highest quality pedal in terms of construction or tones but it gets the job done nicely for cheap if you are just starting to experement with stomp boxes or you are addicted to collecting stompboxes like yours truely you can t go wrong with the fab line i find the placement of the knobs just slightly annoying but it s a nitpick at this price point if you are looking for something like the boss ds this will pretty much cover the bases at less than a quarter of the price of the boss pedal if you are looking for more of a light breakup kind of box on the cheap get the dano overdrive instead the silver one i also find that for about ten bucks more behringer makes some great clone pedals for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup great for a quick practice and really sounds nice wide overdrive and tone range the delay feature is basically a simple slap back echo i d much rather have a chorus in there but for price and the sound i m quite pleased i have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but i hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound this pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts this pedal has three preamp settings ts hot and turbo it s great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar one nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings for example if you set on the turbo setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by boss roland boss mt metal zone overdrive distortion pedal if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great i own several tube amp combo and half stack however i wanted a smaller lighter combo that would be easy to transport and wouldn t need any pedals but would also be loud enough to practice with a drummer the line spider iv watt combo was the perfect solution up to this point i haven t been very impressed by solid state technology sure the cleans are glassy and crystal clear and some sound ok with the gain cranked and mids scooped at super low volume but as soon as you turn up the volume a bit or try to dial in a smooth bluesy overdrive the sound turns to crap not so with the spider iv i ve been extremely impressed with all the different amp models all of them the different amp models each have their unique sound and characteristics which means that your tonal options are literally limitless i play mostly metal and hard rock thougn i use less gain and more mids than is typical among players of the genre i d describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge and i was able to get that tone in less than a minute of fiddling the tone in general is surprisingly warm and organic very tube like which is a comparison that i don t make lightly additionally the highs don t have that artificial tinny sound that so often occurs in solid state solos and leads have more of the natural smooth quality that tube amps are valued for the effects are fun to play with though i ve never used many effects in my playing i really like having multiple user pre sets so i can dial in the tones that i use the most and then switch between them at the press of a button the artist pre sets are cool it s interesting to see line s take on the sound of many popular bands and songs some are surprisingly good like cliffs of dover master of puppets and sunshine of your love while others don t really sound like the artist like killswitch engage i m also impressed with the quality of the celestion speaker that comes with the amp it holds up pretty well even at higher volumes the tone has continually improved as i ve broken in the speaker just in conclusion there s basically nothing this amp can t do at least fairly well all the amp models actually sound good can t say the same about my roland cube and when you combine that with all the effects tuner mp connection and user and song artist presets it s a winning combination this will never be my main stage amp but for practice purposes i couldn t be more pleased with the spider iv edited to add a few months later i bought the fbv express pedal board it s a simple affordable way to get more out of the amp by making channel switching easy and adding a volume wah pedal especially if this is your main amp i recommend getting a fbv pedal to go with it i put this pickguard in a mim white blonde stratocaster and guitar looks so great i didn t need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
448	i am a tone freak i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff at the time i had never owned a big muff i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff the difference was huge the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years it really does have a ton of range although it only does one effect at a time so you d have to reach down and change the knobs mid show in order to get the other variations my most commonly used setting was with the overdrive distortion mix knob at about o clock which produces a very professional sounding grunge type effect if you want any of those s sounds excluding the heavier metal sounds this pedal will definitely get you there people complain that these aren t really rolling string trees despite the fact that the description never says or even implies they are in fact rolling string trees honestly they don t need to be at least for most guitars these small round guides are superior to the flat wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings less contact means less friction less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don t have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move i put them on a cheap telecaster copy i have and noticed the results immediately and i did not replace either the tuners or the nut those are still the cheap stock parts if you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot rollers might be a little better but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade anyone can change them all you need is a screwdriver it was a no brainer for my telecaster i don t travel often with my guitars but needed good protection for those times when i do this product meets all my expectations my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment the corners of the case are well reinforced the hardware is mid grade i believe it will hold up well for my use and for someone playing weekend gigs overall it is a bargain for the price the cm is magnificent it produces beautiful overdrive one that doesn t destroy your guitar s tone it has independent high and low tone controls and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes thus allowing for great versatility in tone manipulation it features a switch that allows you to pick between classic overdrive and an extra blast of distortion modified the case is made of metal it comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitech s tl instead it produces a warm old time overdriven tone i love this thing
449	this isn t the best power supply available it doesn t truly isolate each input the description says the outputs are isolated but what this means is that they are independent that is if one input has a short in it that one will cease to function and not the other working inputs so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not this can cause some issues with noise but there are other things that can cause noise too it s not always just the power supply making the noise it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors a power conditioner will sometimes help as well however the joyo provides plenty of power enough for v inputs and each of v and v it is dependable solidly built comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards i have x pedals on my board with of these joyo units and my board is about x there is some noise but i don t attribute that just to the power supply it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down i m not sure it can ever be completely eliminated but the joyo itself seems to produce very little and it s a third to half the price of the truly isolated units and a definite step up from a daisy chain it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off with a twang twing twong nothing wrong gotta love these strings that just wanna sing it s a cool pedal especially considering it s price but don t be fooled all this pedal does is perform volume swells any other sound you are able to create with this pedal you wouldn t just be using this pedal think of it as a supplumentary effect if you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal you need to use it in combination with other effects reverse delay wah distortion etc it s convenient too if you are playing and you want use volume swells but you also want to use other effects like wah whammy something else that requires the attention of your feet if you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells i would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it pure convenience it has it s quirks though if you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain to the point where its non existent but the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly if sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck the rest will just play as if the effect was off other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure power adapters are your friend it s cheap its convenient but i wouldn t recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry oh that reminds me the casing is plastic i bought this effect because i saw a few youtube demos that made it look pretty good i had always wanted an attack delay effect and the behringer slow motion was priced well below all competitors when it arrived i tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope it only works well under these circumstances all notes must be played slowly individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in you can t play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly having said that i found that the effect is nice once you have mastered the technique i tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal which i have not tried i considered returning the unit to amazon for a refund but i don t think that would be fair as it does work to some extent and it didn t cost me a lot of money in the first place however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend it was not what i wanted when a person has a low income we can not afford what we can not use i was looking for what is called shimmer most reverbs do not have shimmer as the rv because digitech called shimmer string swell and volume swell is linked to the violin sound it cost me its called slow motion for a reason because it has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear it is with over drive being played on the high strings it might be good for playing with a bow i have no idea because i can not afford a bow
450	in particular i favor the dual design why if the need arises it s possible to use a regular strap that doesn t have the button locks installed i have two of the black ones on a string ibanez rg and laguna le qbc guitars i have spare straps for both guitars and sometimes i lock those spares with the plastic dunlop discs i have some older bass guitars with similar dunlop locks the standard version two of which had locks installed in the mid s and one from with the gold dd all three of them have held up with no issues i didn t need to re tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago then again i don t tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as metallica buy this it s cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost times as much it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard amazing sounds for the money i have no complaints the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are it doesn t suck tone this pedal isn t the end all be all overdrive but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don t you lose a little low end when it is engaged but that actually works pretty well for leads especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of classic distortion encountered with el s as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right like any overdrive you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations lately i am running this into either the v cool cat transparent overdrive timmy clone very very nice or the behringer bo which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch jet city combo or palomino combo as with any overdrive this thing will not sound very good imho running into a solid state amp that s just not what it was intended to do it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv because i m a cheapskate and because these things are durable like bricks i bought it used for but it is well worth the new asking price there is such a thing as too much you ll find it in this pedal i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss real good variation from full out rat like to not so much saturation the treble and bass control make huge sound differences its plastic so dont jump on it the i dont use the boost but its cool make it that much more versatile you wont be sorry almost bought a big muff or another rat but im glad i spent way less money i m an acoustic player but every once in a while i break out the strat just to have some fun and get a little variety i wanted to get some of the cool s fuzz going just to play around and experiment for me this pedal was a great way to do that with electric guitar i m not a tone freak and i don t need everything to sound authentic for me this pedal gets you of the way there it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls if you re comparing this to boss fuzz pedal this one is probaly a lower build quality e g made from plastic but it s also only i m not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage so i ll gladly take the savings
451	works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain these are the original perfect fit on my american deluxe strat so durable i got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful d good stuff i just got this and i ve noticed that it when i activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone i have a crybaby that doesn t have the range the does but its x s more transparent there may be other factors at play here as it is new but the lesson is try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone these are very well made with the heads well secured the plastic is thick and of a nice material the cables come with a massive year warranty so i m sure they re not going bad anytime soon buy with confidence
452	just used mine for the first time today love it it is every thing behringer said it was does every thing i need it to do for my two piece blue grass show bwarrrrngarooroorooroorooroororooro beoooooooooooghreaeaughneneeeneeeneeeneeeneeneeneneneee meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh du du duh duh hendrix bro this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return the only problems is that i m not sure i can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that i made on my guitar investment i might have to sell one of my lexuses lexi what the hell is the plural of lexus honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right but now it works great the black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing after a few tries i got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played height adjustment was also important if the latch is to high it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up too low and it does not sound right this replaced horrible pulse hi hat hardware that shook loose every few songs so i am completely pleased with it definitely worth i m not a big fan of planet waves because they ruined the dare strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder the gel is pretty dense so it s kind of hard and squishy and very heavy i found that it just added more weight i m not using it i would look elswhere for a different product this is a very stable comfortable seat the legs are easily removable for storage love that it is rated for higher weights so i don t have to worry about it collapsing i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great the texture almost looks fake though i have both black and white ernie ball straps really comfortable easy to adjust holds guitar securely and both colors look great with black guitars to heavy it doesn t stay where you need it slips down becuase of wieght get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar
453	this is the most awesome loop pedal ever does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered great tone and tuning stability was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat really helped with the bigsby tuning stability you can t go wrong with these i ve installed them on every fender i own even if you don t use the trem very often they help maintain proper tuning if you overbend which i m prone to do i haven t had any tuning or slippage issues when i have these on and you shouldn t either easy to install also and for the money give them a go they re just as solid as the pricier ones and they re fender so how can you go wrong the mxr carbon copy analog delay is a relative newcomer on the pedal scene but has become instantly beloved by professional semi professional and amateur guitarists alike i would be in the latter category as a longtime user of the boss dd digital delay it was a bit jarring trying out the carbon copy but after playing with the controls a bit and appreciating the pure quality of the tone it produces it quickly won me over there isn t a great way to explain the difference between digital and analog delay other than to say that the former is more precise and percussive while the latter provides more warmth and ambience the mod button is suppose to add additional modulation to the tone though i don t hear a dramatic difference but no matter what setting you use there is something undeniably more real about the delay effect of the carbon copy versus other delays i have used rather than repeat your notes verbatim it almost sounds like a haunting middle ground between the reverb echo effect of a large hall and digital delay the range of this delay fortunately is quite wide i believe it goes from to milliseconds to give you some perspective on that slapback delays such as rockabilly stray cats echo are very short probably under milliseconds rhythmic u delays are usually around ms then there s even longer delays with a lot of repeats a la pink floyd s david gilmour this pedal is capable of all of those though the u style delay is better achieved with digital one note on that though whereas the dd uses three different knob range settings to cover its delay time everything from ms is covered with one sweep of the carbon copy s knob this makes it very convenient but also a bit touchy to summarize the carbon copy is outstanding alternative to digital delay and at an attractive price point it covers the sounds of delay pedals over twice as large and expensive and belongs on any delay aficionado s pedalboard this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal it s go from light overdrives on channel to heavy drives on boost channel with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound on the other side you can t use boost channel without drive channel
454	while not as soft and supple as suede straps i am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing it is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker all in all it s a good strap for the money which wasn t much works well and it s clean no noise i m starting to find out even if the price is low it does nt mean it s not good i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim i was looking at some nicer ones and decided to give it a go for only it came in the mail today and i was surprised that basic ness of the packaging very little instructions at all actually this does not ship with a volt battery and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew corner screws on the back to do so wish there was a plastic back or thumb screw option this pedal is really quiet and not in a good way don t expect to boost your signal level with it with the makeup gain output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down it was about the same volume as the original signal only a little noisier did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain add any noise when off most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on due to the nature of raising the noise floor it also has a substantial treble boost low cut going on even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end it is quite bright sounding with that being said it works wonders on single string double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the g b and e strings and makes them sound tight and full it does seem quite durable the case isn t made of cheap plastic which is a good thing though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own the switch and inputs seem a little cheap though granted it was a pedal i feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea however for home non daily use i could see it lasting a while the led is really bright almost so bright that when you re looking to adjust the controls it makes it somewhat hard to see what you re doing all in all if you re looking for a cheap compressor to boost your treble strings and give em some extra punch this may be the pedal for you especially if you only have if you re looking for a warm full bodied compressor this is not the choice for you you should really wait and get the mxr dyna comp for just a few bucks more as musicians sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level for me it happened when i found just the right sound feel from my taylor acoustic guitar the right vocal mics the right mixer my bose l model ii etc today i had one of those finds after years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo i ve encountered i discovered the perfect capo for me the g th performance capo i m not kidding it was one of those finds as an acoustic guitar player vocalist obviously i have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance this means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape structure unfortunately some of my songs had weak spots sending them to my b list courtesy of the combination of a weaker chord for me due to physical limitations the reduced sustain tonal quality resulting from using a capo this dissatisfaction has had me on a capo quest which ended today when i found the g th performance capo the first thing i noticed when i used the g th was the improved sustain over every other capo i ve used all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared i quickly dusted off several songs that were on my b list found the improved sustain tonal quality allowed me to move them to my a list i have no problem with the weight of this capo others have pointed out that it is heavier i can t detect any change in balance when handling my guitar i play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance i love the self ratcheting feature of the g th i thought from some reviews videos i watched that i d have to pinch down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold this was not the case i think the g th has just the right width density of foam under the top bar a providing more friction to hold this capo in place b playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings c possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow harder foam or rubber top bar thus having less impact on tuning i did find one slight negative about this capo which i was able to quickly overcome the end of the top metal bar on the open end of capo is slightly more squared off than the end of the bottom piece which in contrast is rounded off it may be just the way i play some chords but my hand was contacting that squared off end of the top bar was getting irritated so i simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me versus facing the floor the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother thus zero irritation this was nothing new to me i have had to do this with other capos others have commented on the cost of this capo for me the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars i ve spent finding just the right guitars pa s mics other equipment accessories i almost can t believe it only cost me to make such a difference in my sound the g th performance capo is priceless overall i highly recommend this capo if you re like me this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level i m a strong believer in having back ups for critical components so i will immediately purchase another g th as a back up maybe i ll order the black or gold use my silver one as the back up i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product i have been playing professionaly for more than years and in that time have gone through many amps guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts the great ones i have kept over the years ibanez ts and ts mxr compressor etc and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesn t take up much stage room the one item that i didn t have in a pedal form was a good reverb i have had great success with other behringer rack products digital reverb echo eq s patch panels and other home studio stuff the dr was my first behringer pedal i think it works great i have had it for about months and have used it almost every weekend since i got it to play jobs with my band often several nights a week it has given me no problem i can t speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a one spot multi ac adapter well over the past years i ve been running through a bunch of these mini micro battery powered small tubed and solid state model budget amplifiers lets see done all the blackheart small amps the vox mini ac tv roland micro cube plus a few other small amps i just sold my fender super champ xd and wasn t going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors i just cannot jam the way i d like to i really liked all the above named amps but they really didn t give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors loved the fender super champ probably the best but there wasn t a headphone jack same with the blackhearts and the vox ac tv and the potential of these amps just couldn t be used by me so i settled on the vox mini watt because it has a headphone jack is also a c or battery powered among a lot of other great features and sounds but i did have to give up tube amp option so as i said i sold my super champ like a week ago and as i was mailing it out using the amazon online mailing appz when i saw a picture and price in the browser on this new fender mustang i and i figured what the hell lets see what its got to offer for under i mean everyone was giving it a star rating so whats a bucks even though i ve never had a good sounding solid state amp well i must say this thing rocks there are like phases of model amps most i didn t like at first but was able to fine tune most of em to sound pretty great i mean its only a amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals but it does stand up pretty nice plus it has the headphone jack and a couple other plugins and effects and this thing will blow your ears out most amplifier headphone jacks tap out and never got loud enough for me but this thing screams and blow out your ears i ve had it now like days and was thinking about sending it back but for there s nothing in the market that can compare or compete with its sound low pricing and options so i m now glad that i sold my fender super champ xd and bought this one and put the other back in my pocket ya this is the best solid state amp i ve ever owned and i still miss the tube option but i m sure something better will appear next year and until then well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this fender amp i was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet i keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget it stays in tune and don t let the laminated top scare you its great got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great price was right i already own two and had no problems quiet no hummmmm buy it if you need a wall wart
455	cost efficient perfect for a guitarist who loses or wears out picks easily like it alot will probably buy more next year these aren t my first set i can t count the amount of monster cables i bought and own none has ever failed me so far highly recommend these i love how they sound and they are built well i ve always been a fan of these fender classic picks they just feel right wear very well and make a nice sound in conjunction with a good set of strings on my telecaster i also think the price is pretty fair this headstand works like a charm it s simple portable and sturdy p s to the people complaining about it falling over i have no idea what you re doing with your guitars but mine is very stable plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and i ve used just about every brand for the price you can t complain i love guitar picks i have tested alot of them and this is by far the best one that i have found yet they are perfect to hold and very tough although i do wear through them quickly but i do that to all picks it s hard to beat the quality of monster cables there is absolutely no discernible loss of tone through this cable i love it between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered these have a weird feeling when you first get them like they have powder on them but within minutes of using it it ll stick with you much better i love these picks i ve tried every gimmicky thing you can imagine and have always gone back to what simply works these dunlop tortex mm picks i ve tried different brands shapes and sizes and they all just get in the way these aren t slick like some of the others they stay in my hand and they wear ok as long as i don t get too wild and if i ever do drop one they show up super easy on the floor due to their bright yellow color i would be lost if they quit making these or changed them any hopefully they don t these are great use it on acoustic and electric always lose them before i ever wear them out i dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker it works perfect with cakewalk music creator and a digitech vocalist best price out there
456	this is my first fatso flex cable i think i ve had spectraflex cables before and they ve been fine but i ve owned lost lent etc so many over the years i can t recall the look and feel of this cable is excellent seems very solid but it s always difficult to tell with cables i like the flexibility much better than my monster cable which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself the fatso is nice and flexible and it looks fantastic it sounds fine no issues i m not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about high end cables being necessary get something decent that isn t noisy and the tone comes from you and your equipment no issues in that regard with the fatso one last thing you ve gotta love amazon i got a red and a violet for each while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more so i wasn t choosey about the colors i got they look great though oh and one thing i m a bit iffy about is spectraflex s lifetime warranty the fine print requires a sales receipt bs imo and says something to the affect of we will decide if we will replace it so way what you will about monster but they ll replace anything with no receipt which is more reasonable i think but i ll worry about that when it s time to worry about it but it s worth considering as the return process might not be exactly hassle free this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home it s a great little unit the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones bought this in early march this year have it in line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board no problems with it at all it works as advertised i ve found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my fender g dec amp so what does that tell you not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because i love mine for the money you can t get one that touches it so what if it s not that means you have more green stuff to buy other things since buying this one having it work so well i now own a couple of other behringer pedals even though i have a tuner in my pedalboard setup and one on my imac via mainstage the snark is indispensable it s perfect for those times when you don t want to drag out a bunch of gear and just want to noodle around even without an amp i use this little guy for electric guitars and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag i thought my fingers were medium according to the sizing guide but no my fat fingers are not medium i purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing s still kickin not planning on replacing it anytime soon once i got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel action was fine for me out of the box most definitely one of the best bang for your buck acoustic guitars a guitar player can never have enough of these things around these picks hold up well that says alot because i am not easy on picks if any kind i really and suprisingly like this little gadget it works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate
457	i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger i will order a smaller size i am trying to learn a few slide riffs this thick glass sounds fantastic on the strings my bad for ordering one too large i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul i have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the hercules the stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs there is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands i can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place i strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there the extra cost is well worth the investment i bought this at my local guitar shop for after looking into it the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while i was there update a few weeks ago i bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers i usually buy locally but the deal here was great the stand is worth the price and more for what it s supposed to do it works very well i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think this is still usable but it is for very big fingers i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there but this still leaves some extra room either way it works well it feels very sturdy and i m not worried about it cracking anytime soon for the price it s a must have this unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a usb audio input i have not used the headphone monitoring section doubt i ever would so i cannot comment on that feature but this unit is so simple to use that i was pleasantly surprised for anyone in a band out there i used this device to take a line out from our pa system into an old laptop running free audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording this even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage this is my first slide i never use slide to play my guitar look good size is right for me i just have to learn how to use it take some time but it was well worth it i ve always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before i thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big it really doesn t affect play at all so it doesn t matter
458	nice accessory hold plenty of sticks and the angle makes it easier to get to them quickly i play string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff each bass i have has different strings for various reasons and i use this on every one my wife uses on her string acoustic and electric guitars we keep a can in every case i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig i am a bass player by trade though i dabble with many other instrument as many of us do i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows when the sound system is adequate via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals and then to the mixer i use the at xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables this cable at least in its form sounds just as good as my mogami silver xlr i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic i have several i don t have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables on short i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike i ve been using sennheiser s for years and while i am very pleased with them i decided to try the ath m ss on a whim i spent a little more than what i ve been paying for the sennies but it was well worth it i get more of a flat response which is exactly what i needed for monitoring my audio mixes and a trivial bonus a straight cord i hate coiled cords this box is small but packs a great punch i don t notice any difference in audio or loss in sound the two dials for mic and mon levels are nice and stiff and feel like they will last this personal monitor station is much smaller than i thought it would be which is definitely not a bad thing the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only if you find you just aren t getting enough mic in your headphones grab this asap i bought these to replace a pair of ath m s i had for years i used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully i play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what i hear inside the headphones listening to music on them is a joy everyone has an opinion about a burn in period mine seemed to open up at about hours i listen to music about hours a day they sound just like i thought they would i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome i would buy these again i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones but the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music i say go for dr dre beats if you want to know what the noise isolation feels like just putting your hands on your ear i debated between picking up this and the zoom h n and went with the tascam i just couldn t justify the extra or so for the zoom the unit is simple to use and the built in microphones do a great job i picked it up because i wanted a portable unit that would let me use inch inch and xlr microphones with my dslr or capture great audio on its own this accomplishes all of that although i need to use an adapter for inch mics for the inch ports there is no inch mic port which seems an odd omission the unit is almost entirely plastic which can feel a bit inexpensive i know that one selling point of the h n is its sturdy construction still it seems well made and i think it s a fantastic recorder for the price these headphones are kind of classics very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites they are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones however when i compare them to my other headphones sennheiser hd s i find that these are very very inferior i had originally intended for them to be used with my digital piano because i wanted some isolation which my hd s do not provide these do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior i think closed style headphones are just not up to the task of reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones i use these at work now they are excellent at blocking out room noise and they provide enough quality for me to listen to music while working unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my sennheisers they are a bit too small for my ears i guess and they get hot overall they are just not as good they were a good price though and they fill a niche that i need if only i could find a set of really high quality closed cans for my piano now i have one of these as well as several other microphones the sm is a good all around mic the reason it s an industry standard go to but the beta a is a better in my opinion vocal specific mic basically giving again in my opinion a higher quality sound the sm by comparison sounds muffled muddy where the beta a is clearer stronger and more articulate if you re used to the sm then the beta a can sound thin and harsh but that is adjustable at the board end result is that it s a tighter sounding mic with more clarity pattern wise it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds i play drums and use this mic for that reason is that it picks up less of my drums than a sm or a sm garbage if you like it then buy it this is not how the world of music sounds too much bass and other garbage are you guys really hearing anything world has gone bass crazy since about more and more we lost analog we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp and now to put morecrap into our ears they give you onefrequency bass only take it or leave it will go find real headphones thanks kb first time i ve spent over bucks for headphones use for both reference with a gnx and guitar and easy listening very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect semi audiophile a bit bass heavy but overall great headphones very comfortable get hot to wear in the summer i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best i doesn t take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time i bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well for only it is a steal the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy i have used it with multiple mics such as the audio technica with the samson sp shock mount a rode k a studio projects c and a neumann tlm i have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic i was not going to write a review for this product but i came across another review that stated i purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a at with a sp shockmount mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what i try this is absolutely false the samson sp shock mount works perfectly with this stand as any shock mount or mic would since the threading is a standard size i just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion also almost every shock mount has an adapter in the mount where the shock mount connects to the mic stand that is slightly smaller than most us mic stands but this comes out all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it from the shock mount after the adapter is out the samson sp will connect to this stand i highly recommend this product i mix and master all my own music on these guys before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen i cant have giant krk monitors blasting in my small apartment but what i can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light these are not beats by dre they will not make all your songs have super bass and they aren t a great fashion statement however they are work horses and will show you how your music really sounds nicer headphones exist true but these are the best in their price range in my opinion i got these recently a local music shop was wanting per stand so couldn t believe the price of these was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised great quality an very robust this soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player right up there with a tuner string winder cutter cleaning cloth pack of extra picks and capo it s designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system which it does nicely it s also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly as in nights like that in a case i ve owned these for several years and found them sufficient for mixing purposes so long as i keep using reference songs for comparison that s because by themselves the ath m don t have a flat frequency response they re flatter than most phones under a hundred but you will find that they re a bit too middy and lacking in lower treble regions compared with a good set of studio monitors fortunately i found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective eq curve load up a parametric eq and do the following db hz q of db hz q of db khz q of db khz q of db khz q of and db khz q of save this as a preset if you listen to reference songs with this you ll find a more pleasing balanced d kind of sound compared to the original i base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the ath m the proof that this worked is that now these headphones sound a lot like my good studio monitors they translate better with the correction curve active the bass on these is solid and seems to go down to hz or so more felt than heard subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound this is where these headphones are better than studio monitors unless you have a well treated room with a good sub i therefore use these headphones to adjust bass in relation to the reference songs i also use them for editing slight sounds pops clicks and getting reverb tails right and with help panning tracks they are very good for this like a magnifying glass the foam pads and black paint on the headband will crack and fall off after years i wrapped black sports tape around the headband works well replacement pads can be bought on amazon so the padding material coating could have been better made that plus the middy frequency response is why i give stars instead of but i still think they re the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised the sound is very authentic as i have a s tube champ in excellent working order for reference as well as a deville this little amp has the classic fender tube sound with a broad punchy tone and the right amount of compression the included digital effects vibraphone delay reverb chorus and tremolo are all convincing and well executed the modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ tweed deluxe clean dirty baseman princeton clean dirty deluxe clean dirty twin and an array of british and metal amps all and all a super practice amp or mic able performance amp great job fender ps i don t review products that don t stand out as excellent these headphones are wonderful to wear they sound great but that s not enough now a days with the head band being connected to the outside of the muff they fit your head so wide the pioneer hdj has the look read my review on those though they are terrible at first glance these things are serious pro grade they are made of very durable components both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head the head band isn t bad it s a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued not really a big concern though they have a long cord and i ll talk more about it later it ends with a spin on in or a standard mm the sound out of these things is pristine it s not muddy and very clear they have a good amount of bass because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don t leak noise like a lot of headphones do pros heavy duty awesome sound comfortable headband over ear design not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag always clear never muddy even at high volumes very clear left and right ear markings spin on plugcons heavy coil cord heavy weight never got annoying though looks
459	i have a watt combo amp i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube it lacks the brutal attack of the sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the nos rca gray plate i tried for over a year but i m really liking this sound for what it is i think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical with nice natural compression and that s what i m getting out of this jj this switch does work but you should look before you leap the switch travel is greater than it is for a standard way switch and if you use the common fender replacement control plate or one that was only intended for a way switch it may not fit you could fairly easily alter the plate but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate what can you say at less than incl shipping it s a steal i was looking for a very inexpensive version of the popular sansamp and this does it for me decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di i go di to the house and the output into my old seymour duncan amp aguilar gs cab great tone i m using a vdc class ii wall wart found it in my spare parts closet vs v batteries with the wall wart no di hum great does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger if broken or lost who would steal it i d buy another in a heart beat i found this tube to sound pleasant be cheaper in cost than the electro harmonix and work unlike the electo harmonix tubes i received jj s are great tubes this at replaced a ax in the preamp of an epi valve jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone it was very nice but i found an old american made au that i like more the jj is still a great tube
460	i ve had this pedal for over a year now and i ve been getting more and more into tube amps and i ve learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together amps guitars and pedals when i first reviewed this pedal i had just gotten a new solid state amp and i was very let down after i jumped to tube amps i grew to appreciate it a little bit more but i was using it wrong i d just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a nd channel gain stage i thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing but i dismissed it as just an ok box flash forward this thing kills it belongs in front of a tube amp period i ve found as all before me that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state amps the d iii works very well as a clean boost max the volume set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone this is my preferred setting as i can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like i would before using it as a second channel but with that natural tube sound any pedal that gives you some more umph without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thing dial the output down some and crank the volume on the amp a bit more the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone i found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer while not tonally identical this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy heavy tones while retaining the sound of the amp s natural distortion in between you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive after playing around with the knobs i found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal i actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as that s been done to death the d iii is conceptually the same but it just sounds different that the ts and it doesn t let go of the low end for the price this is a fantastic buy it delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost and there s enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone you d want save for modern high gain metal it s a good od but i thought it would be higher output and more articulate just personal preference i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason this little guy has help me record with my apogee one voices and amps to prevent air flow shock on diaphragm wanna have excellent recordings get one i was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive i don t hold it against the pedal though i have a marshall class and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive i get from the amp i say this as a compliment in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have i m gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp you should check out the badasss distortion from mxr too
461	if you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar keyboard sounds this think is great people are trying to hate on this but it is fine i was expecting the worst from the reviews but still wanted it so i got it anyway you don t need the adapter they push the behringer brand v best way to work with this is turn all bands all the way down then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your default normal sound to hear the difference it works nicely and for the price it was a steal in the future i may get a more expensive one this seems fine for now if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder i have a less expensive solution for you if you own a usb wall charger like a cell phone charger you can use that to power your device through its usb port that s a lot cheaper than spending twenty something dollars on an additional wall wart i got what i ordered however if i had paid more attention this is nothing but a standard power supply which i could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the tascam name on it update after receiving comments and reading other reviews i ve gotten a comment and have read many comments and i don t know where the fault lies but this power supply is not the power supply for the new replacement tascam dr mkii the power supply for that unit is the ps p uif you are unsure what power supply for which model tascam recorder you have go to tascam s website and research it before buying it the tascam psp ac adapter power supply for mpgt is for and does work with the older tascam dr recorder i have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered pa head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent
462	behringer perfect pedalboardi can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb from costa rica i recommend it thanks behringer i love dunlop straps because i m a tall guy and they re long enough for me not to look like an electric guitar playing mariachi our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses it looks very stylish and functional as well provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine does not leave streaks if used properly this dries quickly every time if you are using electro harmonix red witch voodoo labs or the larger mxr pedals they won t fit in the styrofoam cutouts you can though just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board i also have a morley wah and they have big footprints so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably right now i have the morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals i own and that four of them are a little outsized mxr ten band eq ehx electric mistress seymour duncan tweak fuzz there is some hum but it isn t so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound so for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters except a dod malmsteen preamp overdrive this is a great deal of course the durability is still in question at this point
463	this works better than the qk b model by the same company slim and easy to install though longer than the qk b since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts you might have to rotate a mic boom etc to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand it worked well and i put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag this unit wiggles a little but not as much as the qk b so the little bit of movement is acceptable this looks to be well built and should be reliable the long haul will be the test i bought the mm picks i would consider them medium thickness if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness the mm is right for me i really like them the mm pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing i know people use yogurt containers credit cards bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks but for me the consistency of the dunlop pick can t be beaten and the price is right too after going to various guitar music stores and trying out many guitars yamaha ibanez fender and others i researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make model and saw the many positive reviews it had i was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first so i purchased the best sounding guitar locally costing me after day i realized i was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online the many reviews were absolutely correct this guitar is wonderful and sounds great i replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the light strings i bought even though it is only an guitar i will treasure this one as if it was perfect intonation all the way up to the octave low action and stays in tune for days i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price after trying to use it i promptly returned it i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer i tried recording on the h using it s line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h was very distorted i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean good quality sound the problem with my h was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp recording from the internal mics seems to work fine i have worked with professional sound equipment for over years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem the h has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings look for something else i exchanged this model for an h n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal but not as bad as the h i finally ended up getting the tascam dr which i am very happy with it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder it s yellow its metal its boss if you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get the best od i have ever owned makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half there are so many reviews of this little jewel i won t bother going into details but it s everything i could have hoped for and more the sound quality is amazing and it s very easy to use i m using it for so many things including a music player for my truck i take it everywhere and it has never let me down i had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that are included i have no complaints awesome product works great it even lets you set your level recording options for low or high level or between settings it has lots of cool features listed in the manual are clearly defined how to use in manual short version it s awesome if an initially unfavorable opinion changes i owe it to the maker to say so so i m saying so for me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used it s not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down in many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved as far as the sn is concerned wrong i ve found the sn to in fact be super tight but one has to insure that there isn t even a hint of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar this is what i don t like about the other type of snark display it s not symmetric it requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit if the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat when i m on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish in that regard the image shown here is wrong it shows the super tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with green and even a yellow uhm no the sn is super tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semi tones if that s what floats your boat and as they say on tv all for an incredibly low price i keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case at this price i already have a half dozen super tights with two more on the way i ordered this bench for last christmas i m satisfied so far good value for money the seat is generously padded and is inches thick padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion all steel frame construction feels sturdy contrary to one of the reviews my bench came with height adjustment it is not on the fly kind of thing though each of the legs has holes low middle high a fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs and the bolt becomes the crossing point of x three positions roughly correspond to and inches for changing height all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it don t worry you don t need any tool to do the job thanks to a large plastic knob see the picture and you ll understand how it works mine initially came with middle position i also tried high and low but set it back to middle it seems to be a good compromise for my family as the bench is used daily by me my wife and my kids sure it s nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily however with this price i wouldn t complain at all i doubt you can beat this for the uke is a solid little guy i shimmed the bridge a little because i can play hard but it wasn t bad pretty well in tune up the neck strings are ok but i do have some aquilas to put on will see if it matters much the tuners are geared not friction like in the one picture at least mine are the carrying bag is just that with no padding or other protection but keeps the rain off i m a keyboard player and in the past i had been spending for monster s delegated keyboard cables but suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use causing me to question the monster mystique i began to compare the monster keyboard cables with cheap off brand guitar cables and couldn t hear any difference no question it s a well made trustworthy but not indestructible or infallible cable but i m no longer committed to it at any price however at amazon s current value price for this particular monster cable it s a no brainer moreover i no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn t say piano or keyboard on it one of my monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club as for length feet is ideal if you re playing through your own amp my preference if you re plugging into a board or p a system you ll want anywhere from feet to feet very playable right out of the box and very beautiful i have a epiphone swingster nighthawk and violin bass and they are all great products i decided to give it a good set up after the strings were off i sanded down the bridge mm and adjusted the neck just a little then i want to really recommend martin bronze strings light or extra light green box for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on strings instructional videos can be viewed on youtube before you go for it or you get a guitar tech to do it ps matching epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an amp or line in recording ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely but it s a pain in the axx to move from one selection to the other there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on off switch does nothing you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again
464	do you like to shift your booty around on the seat you can t with this it s too narrow at inches i am going with a wider one other than that is seems decent updated march th i ordered the on stage kt and have had it for several weeks now i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust the first one i ordered was defective and i had to send it back butt now i am good to go i ordered this bench for last christmas i m satisfied so far good value for money the seat is generously padded and is inches thick padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion all steel frame

this to anyone this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods my only complaint is that i wish it had just a little more height adjustment maybe inch overall it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child this is a really good patch cable fits into different brand of pedals well and is really flexible with out feeling like its cheap i was able to weave it in and out of the pedaltrain pro no problem in fact i ve order more sets of these for the rest of my pedals highly recommended i was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate if not be indistinguishable from the audio quality of the heavy duty shure microphones used at wgtd fm hd all the mics that i had previously tried at this price point and lower including blue s snow line sounded overly treblish with pronounced sibilance listen to the comparison contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration by contrast the yeti is rich and resonant and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter short of spending times more i m convinced this is the best option in my particular case at the same time as a musician without a home studio i seriously doubt i ll make much use of the mic for performance or recording as far as performance goes the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation upstaging the performer at least a vocalist with a normal sized head and for traveling purposes i ve found the sansom go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer even though blue s literature shows the yeti alongside a laptop blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of blue s lighter more compact microphones its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility but as other reviewers have mentioned the volume gain and pattern knobs are rather loose allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement the knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment there s the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control s circular movement but it s not at the o clock position so it s difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid point for quick and easy assessment of positioning in sum the yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably priced mics and it should prove a useful not to mention handsome addition to any home studio it s still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior it s main competitor on amazon the audio technica at is pint sized compared to the yeti and i ll confess i m still not sure whether i made the best choice the mics have been alternating in the and slots of best selling mics on amazon for months now i wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the at s relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise however slight to audio quality i experienced initial hesitancy on yeti s part to make an appearance in the input and output panels in system preferences of my imac then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action my hunch is that a good powered port hub would be equally effective
465	the cables are great for the price cant go wrong i have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered more cables don t buy this cables they keep failing cheap material with what i spent on them you could buy a couple decent ones i use it with a small amp for singing it is just the right size for my amp and it get more then enough control with it well made fast shipping and the price it right for the price these can t be beat at this price it doesn t hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency love is a perfect microphone for karaoke and mobile dj live use it to provide live entertainment and i love your reception is perfect and not recommend it not high quality but definitely useable and worth the bucks ends are not too bad and it works for what it is this tuner is great best buy works so well i highly recommend this tuner can t buy a better tuner for less money the cable is good and normal good price and works well the rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and i have to push them in place all too often i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine this pedal is awesome i use it the most of all my pedals because it s pretty much perfect i can get completely different sounds out of it it s also true bypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off it s much smaller than the big muff pi which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal it is a fuzz pedal so don t buy it expecting overdrive also when it s turned on you will hear a hum but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights and muff pedals hum alot none of that makes me dislike the pedal it s one of the hest fuzz pedals ever i use it in front of a wah and that s all i ll ever need to use pedal wise get this pedal one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers well after starting to use it on windows x i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings i went to the behringer website i found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use windows i am using this with a behringer fx mixer it is a good combo the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough i treat my gear with care i figure it ll probably last for years and years and years i am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation this cable is great for xlr microphones or di boxes they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality its a pop filter it works well and does the job however the neck on this thing is a bit long so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way otherwise its a good option at a good price for the price it serves as a good resting place for the guitar when not being played well designed and useful what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently if you have a standard size guitar neck don t bother with that i would have preferred something that was stationary that i could just stick the guitar in as it is i have to jiggle and align it a bit using hands sometimes which will be annoying after awhile if i buy another it would be a standard hanger you can spend a ton more for a studio level multi channel interface but all i wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out x on my bargain basement pc and this fits the bill works perfectly with audacity and windows plug and play it s bucks so i didn t expect a lot from it but it works as advertised not sure how long the connectors will last though as they do look to be lower quality the cable wire is rubber coated and is easy to roll and store the wire is very thin i ve ahd this cable pair for more than years and have had no problems with them at all i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones here are their key points good quality construction secured heads very long cable no signal problems overall great cable buy with confidence every guitar player should own this tool instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool comes in a really nice case works great great price very light can t speak to durability because haven t had them long and haven t used them heavily be careful i have a small recording studio so we put our cables through a lot and these guys just don t last they were fine for the first few months but then they started to die like a murder mystery seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot thankfully it was just these cables not good spend a little extra on another brand these have been my favorite gls audio ft cable cords what can i say it s a mic cable haha it s a great cable for the price it sounds good and seems to be very durable it s not a monster cable but considering its of the price i can t complain i ordered this as a spare and at this time i haven t used it my microphone came with it s own cable and this was for a what if situation i gave it stars on just expectation just as good as any xlr out there considering i spent for it it rules will buy more when needed
466	wow this amp is something else when it arrived i almost didn t realize what it was because it was so big this thing does everything you can set drums record cords over it and then dub in to the already recorded track and solo over it but what s even better is you can attach drums to it a bass to it a mic to it and a guitar to it and have a killer jam session it has more sounds then i had time to comb through at first glance and more features then i know what to do with amazing amplifier simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings i have used on all my guitars it even fits my acoustic string update year later and the string cleaner is going strong wash up in soap and water and let dry i bought a nd one this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used it cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxy greasy feeling that cream polishes leave this is a must for black guitars great product only wish was that is was bigger than oz it s quite expensive for oz but or sprays does the whole guitar including the neck i do like these strings had a few packs of these from christmas opened up one recently and the string or st string was not in there next time i m gonna have to open up the package to make sure they re all in there should measure them too didn t open them to keep them sealed until i was ready to use them no more these are great picks and yes they are slippery the reason is the material and method of manufacturing delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions these are probably the brightest sounding picks i have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them i use the mm for s on my solid body electrics mm for my s on semi and hollow bodies and mm on my bass guitar that s right i use a plectrum on my bass you can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like nylon
467	i bought this amp for my year old son it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp pros smallclean and dirty channelhead phone jackcons speaker is low quality and sounds rough when distorted or loud suggestion step up and get a better setupgood alternatives fender mustang peavey viper line spider iv vox or marshall i purchased two fender instruments a mandolin and an acoustic guitar each of which came with a fender clamp on tuner with similar functionality but i thought to give the snark a try i haven t used the sound versus vibration mode much nor have i done much with the metronome function much i can t speak to them however i am very pleased with the vibration tuning compared to the fender both will get your strings tuned well what i like better about the snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers with the fender i feel i have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again and that adds up when moving from string to string the snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag the trade off is any easy to read display lately it s become my go to tuner this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard but for dollars its well worth the price this is a great product and i highly recomend it i read the reviews on ernie ball strings i have to say that i love the strings they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive i bought this amp as a back up for my year old son and to take to the park this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it i got of these for my electric guitars they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent do be careful when un folding as pinching of skin would be very easy the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well i have had no problem with the foam cushion so far i have modern finishes on my guitars i don t think i can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing my epiphone lp seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the turser strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include all in all these aren t bad not quite perfect but a good value for the money
468	works great for my acoustic dreadnought if i had any complaint it would be that there s nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall it would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger a little cushion that would go between the wall and the guitar no reason i can t make something like that on my own though edit just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won t fit into this hanger nothing worth complaining about but just something to note if you need a hanger for a classical guitar this isn t it i love these picks especially in this gauge they are a bit thinner than the jazz s so if you master em you can in theory play faster they have a good grip and a nice texture the tone it gives isn t bad either this is an excellent gig bag plenty of compartments for all of your accessories well padded and has enough carrying options a good buy
469	i have one gig bag already not like this fender and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar i bought this fender is lots better then my other bag my other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this fender bag the finder s padding is a bit better than my other bag also but of course neither is as good as hard case i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg i need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar because i use crutches and they require my hands the fender s straps are great the left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty wompass and it became difficult for me to carry the straps on this fender stay put love it the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd but it can also my blueridge br or my seagull s coastal spruce either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly like i said its a great gig bag if i ever need another i ll be getting another fender gig bag i had changed my strings with some new martins i got recently they were bloody awful luckily i d also picked up a package of these ernie ball strings first of all they were packaged better than the martins they went on more easily and after i tuned up they sound so much better thank you ernie ball for making far superior strings my guitar thanks you as well grin i was at guitar center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased ibanez ew asent acoustic guitar which is virtually identical to theibanez ew zwent exotic woods series zebrawood acoustic electric cutaway guitar but everything they had in stock was a bit too small i ve been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger this fender bag received some great reviews but i was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren t correct i couldn t find any info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag so i took the leap and i m so glad i did bag is not too snug not too loose and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps great padding yet still lightweight and a great price and it arrived a day early sweet ibanez ew body not neck dimensions w d l thank you amazon fender adds a little sustain and they look sharp but not gaudy put them on my martin d epiphone aj sce and washburn travel series ro tr nice this was very easy to put together top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable love it it fits almost anywhere and looks cool holds all my drumstick and whatnot i would recommend it to anyone that needs a place for there sticks i am not a fussy person about guitar strings they either sound good or they don t to you and you are the one that matters i was very pleased with getting sets at this price delivered to my front door there are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside martin is at the top of the heap these strings sound light and bright very pleased with this purchase
470	these picks are perfect they are just the right feel for medium and look awesome what more can you say about picks other than they are perfect my new electric guitar isn t particularly comfortable to play while sitting so i needed a strap i ve played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable so i hoped to find a padded strap that didn t break the bank this strap fits the bill just fine depending on the angle that your pegs are set however you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling if your pegs are set at an angle like on a strat this strap will last forever if you re on a guitar with a horizontal peg like a lp you ll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well this will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security the padding is ok but not great however it s certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus mid level quality the shoulder strap tends to move while you play gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist i have tons of picks and these are well made and easy for me to hold in my hand without slipping around too much love love love this pick holder this is the second pick holder like this that i have purchased for different family members bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding and to have the padded area longer i like cool gadgets and this is no exception the red color is a metallic color and i totally dig it the display is nice and bright as well super accurate tuning well worth it for the price
471	i have a fender t bucket acoustic guitar and i put heavy guage strings on it as beginner these strings were not good for me i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings good quality glad i bought these pros records excellent audio through built in mics records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile i love the track ability and the effects built in to the device i can record multiple things in less time especially when i m just messing around to get a feel for a song comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box cons battery life is weak built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want it fits nice an tight on mic stand you can get around ten picks in it so it s a good product this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster i had some noise even at moderate volumes after shielding it is absolutely quiet this peel and stick tape has conductive glue so you don t have to solder the overlap joints i overlapped about and had a x piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity the tape is petty easy to use sticks well inside the cavities and is strong i didn t break or tear any pieces i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups first saw on youtube video how genius a pick that stays in hand makes me wonder how ever played without them small price for big help i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa i don t think that many people would do this the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box it works for me i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp
472	this is my th joyo pedal and like the others it does not dissapoint i think these and the dano cool cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days like many have mentioned this pedal is like a ts but without the mid hump this pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture when you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it it breaks up when you play lightly it gets cleaner which is why it is so similar to the sweet honey pedal the controls are also identical but i haven t compared the internals that touch sensitivity is lost imho if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain when you do that it acts more like a traditional od would which is totally cool but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart if i could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more mid gain like the joyo ultimate drive or the dano transparent od but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and don t have that kind of bankroll you should definately check this out edit having owned this pedal for a while i realize i was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox this pedal actually plays well with mid gain types of overdrives like the joyo ultimate drive the ocd or the dano drive when you dig in you can get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isn t dimed this pedal has become an essential always on pedal for me the vt vintage tube monster has quite quickly become my go to overdrive pedal surpassing other od pedals i ve used including the digitech bad monkey the ibanez ts tubescreamer the boss sd super overdrive and remarkably the fulltone fulldrive mosfet the vt has several things going for it tweakable eq high mid low which allows you to run a full spectrum from muddy dirty low od sounds even from a single coil to bright screaming lead tones with high mids or highs noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to squeeze the tone for some interesting effects wide range gain that gets dirty around o clock and full on distortion when crankednow for full disclosure sake i did change out the tube to a jj tesla ax but most people who know tubes will tell you that really tubes are often hit or miss simply on account of them being analog heater based elements that s part of the fun of tube based od i have played a vt that had a great sounding overdrive but mine didn t have that sound until i put in a new tube try it out with the stock tube and go to a different tube if you don t like it at least try a new tube before giving up there are two things that i don t like about the vt and i can tell you both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone this pedal got it right with tone after a tube switch the issues are the housing is huge and if you look inside it seems like a waste of space there s a lot of open space with nothing there and while i can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat it s a bit overboard compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss especially given the large enclosure it would make perfect sense to move the knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side that d take little effort and given the independent power of this pedal would be a piece of cake to achieve heck i could probably do it myself but i don t want to ruin the good sound this produces bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything this takes up at least the space of pedals is it worth it to me it is i run od pedals on my row board and i can honestly say in the last gigs i have never gone to the other od it s been the vintage tube monster every time it sounds good not as a professional tube driver but quite well for the price perfect for begginners and intermediate players that can t afford something else that is a little bit more expensive this thing is amazing like many i cannot afford a tube amp this transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps i played years ago sustain and harmonics are insane preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones the unit is very heavy and rugged the only component i would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though that s my preference but i would use no other tuner on stage i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars i have dozens of guitars
473	i knew it would be small but i wasn t thinking this small it shore is cute good enough for now but not for the long run shore its loud for the size but it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides from vibration if you keep it on lower sound its fine this is only for temporary use for me its an ok tiny mini little amp for it s size its good don t exspect a fender amp thats all it is a guitar stand does what it is built to do good buy for the cost i would purchase again this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar my fretboard hasn t been cleaned oiled in years so it was extremely dry the cleaner removed visible grime the polish cloth shined up the frets but most importantly the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel i am very pleased with the product this guitar just got stolen from me frikkin thieves i loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands it is super light unlike my other gretsch guitar so easy to take anywhere it can handle some rough playing its simply awesome specially for what it costs i am sooooo getting another one d despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box this is a high quality gig bag with plenty of storage space fits either a tele or strat i don t typically keep my guitars in their cases but bags like this one come in handy for gigs short trips moves etc nice styling touches too the bag has removable back straps for carrying ease i have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers including a few of the vox valvetronix series however this is both my first fender amp as well as my first true tube amp first some clarification is needed on tube vs modeling amp the fender super champ x is absolutely a tube amp it has one ax and two v s and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages however the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone which is what allows it to project different voices contrary to what some posters have written channel does also have some front end modeling except that the the model is fixed for blackface tone and controlled by a separate volume know no gain control channel offers different voice presets and of these model a variety of vintage fender amplifiers including the tweed deluxe bassman deluxe princeton and twin settings model a variety of other popular amps including the vox ac and marshall overall i found the available tones to be excellent unlike my valvetronix where i more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times i could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars one thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently you may have to adjust volume gain bass and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp however i found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component also the x does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or hissing you hear with digital modeling amps the tones that come out of the speaker of the super champ x are very rich and touch responsive as you d expect from a tube amp the amp has tons of high end sparkle but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume true of many amps the stock speaker which is fender s own design and has a ceramic magnet i believe is frequently criticized as a weak point however it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps or only intend on playing at bedroom levels you re unlikely to take issue with it the eminence ragin cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end but again the amp is plenty loud and full sounding for its size better intended for home studio use than most gigs but it excels at what it does that brings us to the effects section and the fender fuse software that works with the amp via usb cable frankly i m not a fan of most on board effects with combo amplifiers i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrive distortion the good new is that the on board reverbs which include spring room hall and a few others if you install them from the software are quite good you can also reassign the presets to different effects so if you want a flanger with a reverb you can have a setting for that if you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb you can do that too the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects but as i said while they represent a good value for players that don t want to invest in pedals i m more likely to use my boss dd than the on board delay and so on the build quality of the super champ x is largely excellent the grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of fender s more expensive amps the amp weighs in at pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top one thing i did note however is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting so i will have to be careful about that also there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better but overall the amp looks very well constructed i was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic but everything is mapped to vintage looking knobs and from a few feet back the amp looks just as much at home in the s as it does post overall i think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that i hope to enjoy for years to come i m only really scratching the surface of its potential but it makes great fender tone sound easy the fender fuse software could be a little more intuitive to work with and i wish there were a better way to know what each of the voice and f x settings correspond to without consulting a chart but it s a great little amplifier that s all the power you d need for hobbyists and studio recording and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well
474	i tune my guitars ukuleles cavaquinhos and piano with various tuners like the korg ga or korg ca or korg tm and i pair this korg cm tuner clip and the difference is huge you no longer have to worry about background noisei clip it on the headstock of my guitar uke cava and it tunes them quite well on the piano i can clip it on any part and it picks up on the tuner it works as well as most all of the clip on tuners you see on various guitars and ukuleles nowadays but if you have one of the chromatic tuners that don t directly clip on like the intelli imt series then this will make it work x better okay slightly exaggerated because the ambient noise is not picked up by the tuner s microphone i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good it is amazing what difference the strings can make i have ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings highly recommended the korg cm l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument my instructor who has been playing a violin for about years brought one to my private lesson recently because it did not pick up extraneous room noises it made tuning my violin for the lesson so much faster and easier not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased i used it a few times it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic i wouldn t buy another one
475	these are a little flubby thick and soft for my taste in guitar picks but they mellow out the tinny sound of my mandolin beautifully the textured grip surface is great they have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better and they give u some spares i have purchased three of the fender f neck plates for three different mim strats they all went on easy caused no problem and they look really cool i like this so much i bought and going back for more spring loaded pick holder holds about to picks there is a peel and stick on the back to attach it to a guitar strap or behind the headstock i keep one in each guitar case i am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick i did the swap myself in a couple of minutes this are the ping model ratio and they stay in tune just perfect ok so they are just screws but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one and it is fender licensed this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp seems well built and rugged although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace quality tuners overall i like the look and feel of these the only complaint i have is that after locking the strings the tuners loosen slightly a short while later so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked all in all though very good for the price i put this on my fender jazz bass after i bought a new neck for it this plate work the exact same as the stock plate but it dresses the bass up a bit this is not a mod that people will see like pickup covers but i like the way it looks when i pick it up to play great price for a carbon copy pedal just buy it you wont regret it it beats spend gobs of cash that you could spend on other things this is a very nice looking back plate and for the price its cheep the holes are in the right place for the screws nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat installed easy and the screws and everything were correct i would recommend this first of all don t expect any new tuner to work as a drop in replacement drop in replacements for tuners basically don t exist unless you have the exact type of tuner and in that case you aren t doing an upgrade you ll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer or if there s a guitar center or guitar shop nearby have a tech do the work for you these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look they would look great on a either a strat or tele unfortunately my squier bullet had a slightly smaller headstock which meant that the low e string s tuner was too large the wing for the screw hung over the edge therefore i will not be installing these on my guitar but that is not the fault of the tuner functionally these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate and i ve heard the hold tune just fine check the back of your headstock for fit but if that s a go these are a great option mounted and this looks like a solid product i was working on a new replacement neck and had no mounting holes i just looked at pics on the net and got them close i like them
476	makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller and cutter all in one arrived quick and before scheduled these work perfect for my needs good power supply for the cheaper yamaha keyboards i have never understood why yamaha keyboards don t come with a power supply so i found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine no problems don t buy the one from the store this is cheaper be patient and get this one if you buy the keyboard you re going to need the power adaptor sucks that yamaha runs this scam of not supplying the power cord and making you buy it separate but i suppose the nickle and dimes really add up for them power cord fine yamaha shady i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn t know the clip didn t come with it so i had to order a clip later nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks it is also rubber in construction so it won t crack like the other low quality clips it is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is good i would recommend it this is actually the first capo i have ever owned as i am pretty new to playing the guitar that being said i paid close to with free shipping for this capo and i feel it is a good value it feels well constructed like it won t break if i drop it the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar s neck the spring mechanism is plenty tight but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed even while playing the capo is sleek looking and a bit smaller than i was expecting at x but i have no frame of reference for comparison item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging part number cb made in usa no counterfeit here if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will answer as best i can thanks for reading spo
477	for the money there isn t a better tuner on the market today this is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really this tuner is s pot on every time and super fast you can move from string to string quick this is my rd vox amplug i have purchased through amazon they are all awesome in thier own way the satriani amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb without the effects on it is similar to the lead plug with much lighter distortion still has nice crunch to it though if you are a satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining if you could only buy just one this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play i love metal rock classic rock etc the first song i played through this plug was the star spangled banner ala jimmi hendrix and wow the satch effects just make it sound amazing the top gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well if you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the metal amplug it rocks your face off i love mine the ac amplug is real nice for classic rock and country it is nice and clean but can go into ac dc tones very versatile amplug the satch amplug is a welcome addition to my collection i would tell you to buy it and if i lost mine i would replace it immediately same with the metal amplug if i lost my ac amplug i would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another as versatile as it is i don t play enough classic rock or country as i do metal a little small for my hands but the kids that take lessons from me loved them cute idea would like different holiday designs like this a very nice pick both in feel and texture the design is a bit boring though only complaint is that it s fairly small about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a cent piece but that s okay i got this the same time as i got a set of dava jazz grip red picks and the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks and i think i like the dava picks the best all three are tight grip picks and all the same size they re all good though i d rate this one next best and the jazz iii carbon fiber next after that
478	i ve only been playing ukulele for about years so i m new to using a capo it seems to hold tight one of the strap buttons on a guitar i was given as a gift was missing i was told that it would need some minor repairs so all i had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it this strap button was screwed right in the minute i got it and it worked like a charm i put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn t given me any problems the quality and feel of this tuner is very good tuning the guitar is really easy just put the batteries in it comes with aaa batteries and press the red button to turn it on then pluck the strings this is my first tuner and its great already it s very portable i have been using this since the day it arrived it was very easy to setup although windows reads the device as a speaker so the usb does not work for me that way it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it nothing that spectacular really it did it s job was easy for my husband to use made me able to use a strap on my guitar however i have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching usually i do my bad arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar very easy to install but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument the only thing that would have been nicer and bumped the rating up would be to send a felt pad with the button i used a rubber washer i had and that worked very well it was easy to install it s a simple strap button don t know what else to say i can t imagine a strap button not serving it s purpose i hate minimum word review requirements
479	i ve been swapping back and forth between evans and remo for a while but after really liking the emad kick head i decided to lean more toward evans just for consistency in my setup i consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest compatible drumhead to what i really liked from remo on the evans line and i was led to the g series from remo s emperor series both being plies of mm free floating film honestly i think i m going to stick with evans from now on though i ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the level sizing and i wanted to give them a try my fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that i got was new enough to be l sized i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy i use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process but it went smoothly not sure if it was the placebo effect but i seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well deeper but just as resonant as an kick the coating seems to hold up better on the evans heads as well remo tends to flatten out within a few hours of play where the evans not only lasts longer but has a more finished feel to them these are nice and sturdy picks they sound real clean i m having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics this strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff the only issue i have with it is that the ends are not the same size so i could not install my dunlop straploks for it it may just have been the one i got though this little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar s output while playing outside on the porch the amp produces a much bigger sound with much better quality than expected this does eat up v batteries so we also picked up an ac power adapter for when he uses this in the houses we also like that this has a headphone jack which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in highly recommend cfh not much to say about a guitar strap except i had planned to use it on a simga acoustic without a pin at the neck i ended up using the strap on my strat for the acoustic and this one is on the strat this one doesn t come with a wrap or tie for the nut so it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body if you need to secure one end at the headstock this is not an option it is comfortable though i bought this intending to use it on my seagull acoustic but tonight i put it on my squier fat strat instead after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap which was about the same price just because it had fender embroidered on it was making my neck when i put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap so i decided to sign in and write this review this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need consider taking my advice treat yourself for a strap when guitars cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars is not much besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe the only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegs i use c type snap on strap locks but they will no longer fit maybe i ll see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work you can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on sale update too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also very comfortable strap the cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far this is a perfect strap for my guitar it s not rough on my neck and is very adjustable it s very simple and is perfect for me i m very pleased with this purchase bought this to use on my strat reissue after a year or so of playing the rosewood fretboard become a little dried out and rough of course covered with hours of grime and sweat this kit has everything you need to make your guitar feel look and play like new i put new strings on after using this and man felt just like the day it arrived from the factory can slide and play much smoother with this serious speed improvement i like to walk around while i play it s a hangup of mine this strap works fine for that the only thing i ve noticed that can be annoying is that strap moves easily across my back so it is very easy to get the guitar out of position the neck too high or too low other than that it s a good deal for the price maybe i just need a shirt with more cling in the interest of full disclosure this is the first guitar strap i have ever owned that being said the strap is fairly soft and pliable with that almost broken in feel i was expecting it to be a little stiffer but i m glad it isn t it fit my ibanez acoustic just fine my guitar is nothing fancy so i would presume the strap locks are pretty standard the fit is really tight at first so that should be a good thing i suppose i could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap but i didn t the range of fit seems pretty good to me i am tall and wear my acoustic up a little high kind of folk style i guess if i want to i can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area one end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather logo patch on it while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside i can t see it marring the guitar at all it is comfortable around my neck and shoulder made in canada seems well built and durable once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back and keith gets to keep his head fashionable if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will answer as best i can thanks for reading spo only complaint is that the cameo is not as well done as shown in the picture other than that the strap is of good quality
480	i have always used d addario strings since the early s when i first found out they were manufactured right here on long island i ve never been disappointed by the quality i don t play with a guitar below my waist i am six feet tall while very well made wide comfortable and good looking this sling was far too short and had to be returned my only complaint is that it doesn t fold up smaller but otherwise this is an excellent stand i have to concede i m a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myk m memphis pro guitar stand however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build the extra heft of the hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand the k m tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor despite not folding up quite as small the hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust one action for legs one action for height whereas the k m has three separate legs and two vertical sections clamps i do realize that i bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the k m length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the k m large enough that i won t try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as i do the k m i m also not convinced hercules trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand the back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it s knock the whole stand over no big deal just more parts and weight i think i prefer k m s yoke as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting gates both work perfectly well with my fender and similar bass head stocks i ve had two of the k m s and the second was a bit of a disaster it was defective in more than two areas defects happen but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit and lead me to try the hercules i won t go into all of that here see my review on that product aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke the hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness i m glad i purchased this one and i think i ll get plenty of use from it but i should mention it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the k m mainly its awesome portability despite its slightly more fragile nature in the interest of further comparison i ve got anultimate gs support genesis guitar standon order and will review it against this and the k m as well i opted for the gs without an automatic closing mechanism over the gs which has one for the reasons i stated above i don t believe it is strictly necessary the reviews of the gs are also more favorable and the gs is cheaper which suits my cheapness i used to have a regular guitar strap on my bass but when i got a regular weekly bass gig and was using it more often it started to feel like the strap was digging into my shoulder your mileage may vary on that but i decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bass i read a lot of reviews and decided on this one some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable but this one was usually reviewed well it was the perfect choice this strap needs no wearing in it s supple and soft right out of the box the leather on top is smooth and classy looking and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder the wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort i use dunlop strap locks on my instruments and with a thicker strap like this i had some concerns about getting them on there but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap no problem i would highly recommend this strap for any bass player or even someone with an especially heavy guitar i bought this because someone told me they really liked it but it s just not a good product for me anyways i bought this to help disperse some of the weight of my les paul on my shoulder the problem is the thick part of this strap is made too short so if i bring the neck of the guitar up to my shoulder at all the weight of the guitar is now on the skinny part of the strap the leather feels a bit cheap as well you get what you pay for i guess the strap is ok if you play with the guitar in one position yippeee i ll probably have to break down and pay for a real strap straps don t get any better than this super leather very well put together perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets for the gigging pro i think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight excellent just excellent
481	this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better i can play for hours and my shoulders feel fine i feed the narrow end through of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good well made feels very strong texture is very nice doesnt slip overall a very good product i tried this at the store it looks like it would protect a guitar but the latches are kind of large and clumsy the interior was nothing special either i passed what can i say these are great patch cables solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect and i ve had crappy cables that buzzed when you looked at them cross eyed these don t do that no gold connectors and if you need the best of the best maybe you should be looking elsewhere for the rest of us who are looking for good stuff at a good price these are the ticket highly recommended what a nice strap it s a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnought the whole strap is leather no adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument it took me a little while to get used to this method but now i don t even think of it the main strap has several slots cut into it and there s another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place it s simple and very secure it makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain but how often do you adjust your strap length once you ve gotten it set i almost never do it s an affordable strap that looks elegant is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar has great length adjustment range and rolls up to fit in the case i had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitar i have a pickup system installed and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly i would buy it again i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster this product is great i use it after every session keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board every guitar player should keep this in their case yes i finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock it never needs to be removed it s accurate it s easy to use it s low profile highly recommended i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people the strap is about too short for my seagull s guitar i will say the build quality is great but too short is and remains too short i will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap i just can t understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short i fired off an email to levy and the long and short of all this is you will have to fork over another to buy an extendo for this strap i don t quite understand why they don t make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another to make it work right in the first place here s a link to the extendo optionlevy s leathers mmgxl brn strap extender http www amazon com levys leathers mmgxl brn strap extender dp b bh n e ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords mmgxl the irony here is i managed to buy the last one for the immediate future this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider i got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now i have this cobbled up looking guitar strap it s sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other i will keep this strap but sure feel like i ve been had on this purchase the terms bait and switch come to my mind nice strap very comfortable doesn t cut into your body at any point easy to adjust worth the price would definitely buy another this shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand it just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils pens clip on tuners capos etc it pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page i love how a pen capo or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is trained to stay in place a must have five star item would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice it is a little stiff feeling compared to the others i have purchased but overall it is very nice just a great strap a straight up product well worth the money man it s good to buy something from someone who puts their name labor and product on the line then delivers here it is you want it come get it can t miss dealing like that thank you
482	gorgeous strapped to my son s martin acoustic guitar he loves it it s pretty without distracting from the guitar itself very well made and durable i ve even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time this will last a very long time it really nice made in canada not china wow that alone impressed me like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material yes you can bend it it will probably last life times ends are made of leather one advantage is that once you set it to the appropriate length it will not change easily if your switching to different size guitars this could be a problem cause you can t make an on the fly quick adjustment on stage you will be wrestling with it this strap is really beautiful the native american pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar i made with the images of wolves burned into the top however the leather ends are very thick and stiff making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar i tried to put the snap on strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them i have a nice ralph marlin strap with soft pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort workable with one hand i d give this levy s strap stars if its ends were as flexible levy s leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material especially on the edges it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt yukko the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap just a great strap a straight up product well worth the money man it s good to buy something from someone who puts their name labor and product on the line then delivers here it is you want it come get it can t miss dealing like that thank you put this on my cheap acoustic guitar and it looks so good i might have to upgrade my guitar not much else to say about it it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do
483	i have been using those webbed nylon sometimes cutting straps for years cause they were inexpensive but not cheap don t know why i waited so long quality in this baby comfortable too wow very cool gadget and well executed this review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks i have not tried it with other stringed or non stringed instruments the thing is quick and accurate the display colors are bright and easy to read it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing in fact if you play a chord it will usually guess the root note of the chord it clips on easily and firmly it is very sensitive i find that i have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work but i can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune usually without having to pluck it again before i have it right as an added bonus in my case the color happens to be a great match for an epiphone sg g in cherry red first the goods sturdy leather construction just cant be beat the color is spot on with the pictures shown the bads it s a bit short i have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the shoe lace around the head stock method i had to max this strap out to make the span i m a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldn t have this problem then there s the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadn t considered it drags and pulls your shirt really bad making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang that problem is not specific to this strap but the material its made out of it s high quality but i didn t consider it trying to pull my shirt off if had to do over again i d pass rugged good looking efficient sorta like me have several tuners of different names and quality but this seiko is certainly the quickest the rubber housing is an excellent idea would buy another this capo does exactly what it should it clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used i have kyser capos one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide attaching it is a snap the suede gives it a nice grip to your shoulder so the guitar doesn t slide around
484	nice quality plug i used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals works great and no noise the shielding on these planet waves cables are great i was impressed by the quality of this product it is simple and does its job well easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or les paul or with a thin neck on most metal guitars holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise was a great value study strap great feel leather matches my instrument well width worked well for me compared to the version heavy construction in layered leather there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking i will buy another in a second color for the money this is a tremendous pedal the next step up might be the new mxr bonamassa tube pedal but that is almost double the price by the way bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one maybe the maxon made version i doubt there is that much difference very well made and useable and effective tone controls unlike other pedals that i find only click in at the ends of the adjustments and the middle area is modest it is great and i kinda like the great look you really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit it has gone up more than percent in just a few weeks this jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required a ft cable is too long i would not depend on it for night after night abuse but it just may last longer than i think planet waves does make good products
485	whatever good things you ve heard about the at is probably true well unless if you ve heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky but it sounds great when your recording songs haha i record with fl studio and it s even great so far i recommend you get this this mic is fantastic i ve been singing writing and recording for almost years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive german mics i ve used in larger studios over the years there s a very slight presence peak but nothing like most of the other chinese mics it isn t shrilling or peaky at all male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for eq whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub hz stuff this mic is also an excellent candidate for a michael joly mod he calls it one of the audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under michael mods these mics and you d be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous u with the german name that starts with an n i m using it totally stock and it s been great buy it these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors and they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do which is why i replaced them i suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost
486	i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem but i got literally plug ins and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends soooo it s pretty much useless to me i guess if you get one of those power blocks with v outlets on them i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss i think i payed like for it so whatever i would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end this daisy chain worked very well for me no problems yet i m powering about six pedals currently and i am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound i think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank and it should work with any single spot a c adapter you might already have so no need to buy another hands down the best cable i have ever owned i was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now i spend that money on other stuff i play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for or months well worth the money lifetime guarantee to boot definitely will buy mogami from now on i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a spot brand plug it is not what i received instead i received a generic plug for eight v connections that would definitely fit the purpose but a really cheap version the plugs on this generic version are larger than the spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic the original spot plug has much smaller plugs great for saving space on a pedal board and the wires are soft and rubbery again making it easier to work with on a pedal board specially if you re working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the spot plug to make sure there would be no mistake but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original spot plug wouldn t know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight v connectors i strongly recommend spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original spot plug this cable expands the capability of the one spot or godlyke v adapter the quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards the best thing i ve purchase for my guitars this year i m not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning the and are the best restore the live of my fretboard the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine the only one that i ve just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don t play with it after the cleaning but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase without going to extremes and spending two hundred bucks on an nos tube from i recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hit jj s tubes are well trusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliability btw axt and ecc are the same tube i can t remember the last time i had a jj tube go microphonic beyond control i have played full time for over years i use these hope this helps i have one spots which came with the multi plug cable after reading a little bit on the internet i read that the one spots can handle almost pedals each depends on the pedal power handling etc so i saw they had an plug cable and figured i would try it out with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy peppy perky free i do i do i do
487	i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer pedal board most of the b pedals work quite well i have no quality issues with them some people complain about the plastic cases but they are tough and reliable unless you re in the habit of abusing your pedals by smashing them around or can t control your stomp pressure some are better than others and this one works perfectly i have b pedals one of them is a tuner and each seems to add some noise to the amp output especially when it is in quiescent mode no signal input this pedal placed at the end of the line just before the signal goes into the amp quiets all that noise that the other pedals generate i had to check this because i at first thought my amp was making the noise but when i bypassed all the pedals my amp was quiet which was a relief then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust the send receive function is for quieting the noise you send to an additional effects pedal which seems pointless as the best way to use this is to put it at the end of the chain to quiet all the effects the mute function may help but when i turn on my pedal tuner this also functions as a mute i had to do a little modification of the b pedal board to make this fit in as i already had pedals in place but with the removal of a couple of screws it fit into a slot meant for a longer pedal i don t actually need the on off function on this most of the time so placing it in that sideways out of the way spot was no disadvantage i just leave it on all the time so it always quiets the noise when i m not actually playing however i can still operate it if necessary for example for the mute function if i needed that it s aggravating to have to have a pedal to eliminate noise from other pedals but at least there is an easy solution in a noise gate like this one first let me say im using this for a bass at least for this review and nothing else that said i lovebehringer products that i own this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak as comparedwith other chorus i have such as art zoom peavey line gibson or we could say in a more positive phrase very subtle the stereo effect for me was non existant but realize i bought this item over buying a normalaby switch doing so saved me a bundle but in the long run i will pay for it there is a high cycle hum in the background which almost all chorus units end up having but i can say it did the job as far as splitting a signal into amplifierheads and doesnt seem to have a problem with the signal being delivered note if you plan on using a volt dc adapteryou have laying around in yer gear scrap bucket think again wont work i tried different volt dc adapters to no avail all that said i still gota give the item its due negatives the unit is made out of plastic and you will have to take it easy when engaging on off i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on it was due to the fact it just has a small strip of rubber that is supposed to engage with the buttonswitch on the electronics board you may have to put something behind it or replace it this is the answer to your all your power supply needs if you own more than pedal and we all do you need this it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with plug it comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for pedals it has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain it also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in and it has a foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing you ll save enough money to pay for it in no time not having to buy batteries get it you ll love it i first behringer pedal i have returned almost no effect provided by pedal i have returned the unit not worth it lousy pedal well behringer have to say that the electronics are german mind with all that says go figure it out for yourself other then that plastic so i give stars cuz of the soft plastic case and the trouble of changing batteries but u can use the charger and u will be well off sound is really awesome for the money and it is high standard delay time and sound i don t think u can get the german quality anywhere else for bucks i say buy it it is a great delay pedal and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money can not go wrong i am user that likes behringer products i know is plastic but com on it s just what you should know about this pedal it s like the boss ch but a plastic version a durable one by the way
488	basic delay i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically made my tone thin and tinny i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome exactly what i was looking for and for the price i can not get a better deal totally satisfied i bought a few of these to hook ipods iphones to live stage sound systems most of which are not in stereo anyway so why use stereo to mono adapters or separate channels when it s not needed perfect solution seems durable this is a great strap nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible best part this strap gets long long long yep here it is well behringer have to say that the electronics are german mind with all that says go figure it out for yourself other then that plastic so i give stars cuz of the soft plastic case and the trouble of changing batteries but u can use the charger and u will be well off sound is really awesome for the money and it is high standard delay time and sound i don t think u can get the german quality anywhere else for bucks i say buy it it is a great delay pedal and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money can not go wrong as usual another good piece of equiptmentfrom behringer i not only use it for my guitars but also on my keyboardmakes real good sound very adaptable again will buy more of their products as usual most of my purchases on amazon were quality stuff at good prices very efficient and fast delivery times this amp is small in size but full of sound because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks very responsive very clean sounding this amp is well worth the price i got this and it works well apart from the fact you have to really bang down on the keys im hoping over time they will be easier to press i originally wanted the boss dd but after doing a side by side demo i decided that i m not buckethead and don t need a dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not no they do equal to my boss counterparts especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isn t stock boss i wouldn t take these on the road or anything without or backups but for recording and doing demos behinger is the way to go timed effects wise anyway they are made of plastic after all i use the us for short lead riffs it works great in a sweetening role it is easy to change the key manually in point of fact much easier than i originally thought it s a main stay on my pedal board now
489	pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway good price bought several of these and they worked fine i later moved on to planet waves for my custom pedal board because i could get the lengths perfect this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there it is very well made resistant tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape looks good too i would recommend to get a few roles of power grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcro included especially if you have a combination of both regular size mxr or boss and bigger pedals like a cry baby or a vox satchurator or time machine reverb if thinking of purchasing one of these you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized now if you are on the road for long i would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok i ve owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards first the pt and now the pro i use this to house a line m m a korg pitchblack tuner clyde deluxe wah and a boss channel switch there s plenty of pedal board real estate for all of this and the soft case is incredibly strong and durable you can imagine my board being very heavy and it is but the soft case does a great job the included velcro keeps the incredibly heavy m and m securely in place even when i store the pedal board upright on edge between weekly gigs there s also a lot of places to use zip ties to clean up your rig also comes with a great little bracket that will house the voodoo lab and possibly some other pedal power supplies pedaltrain makes a great pedal board
490	i love this capo let me tell you about my capo journey where i ve used every brand while searching for this one first i always owned the old dunlop toggle action capo which is just old tech you know where it s just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber the kind one used to use before i had to go back to that when my first planet waves black thermoplastic capo broke don t buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca each one i bought broke one broke within a week during the winter rainy days so i loved those capos they were perfect but i was done with the breaking so i figured i d try others instead despite my love for the planet waves design i didn t know about the silver aluminum one yet well i hated each other one i tried kyser if you have had carpal and or are small handed you know what i mean you don t want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don t want to play the guitar i really hate the kysers i know some folks love to squeeze and use them that s fine different strokes right then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me omg that thing is so ridiculous it pops off it wiggles about it is tricky i hate it now i know many folks are schub fans who give me a drive by downrate i m not saying it isn t great for those who love it if you love the schub you love it unconditionally and i respect that all i m saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me there are other models that fail similarly to these they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands like the g i did fall in love with it until maybe the th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on awk ward and painful sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby but if you have carpal you know what i mean you want to go easy on the hands and arms and not brutalize them the other thing i ve always hated about the kysers and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder that s just dumb kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don t mind it or claim it doesn t do that but you know what i m talking about ok so then because of all the broken planet waves thermoplastic capos i turned next to dunlop s turnscrew models i liked them they are very similar to the pw design but the screw location is more awkward to use and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model this is it right here the silver one is excellent and it s made of aluminum not thermoplastic i bought one and it has lasted me almost years now without a single problem by now in contrast i would have run through or thermoplastic ones i want to say that if you are performing in a public venue never use the thermoplastic ones because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room and could easily poke someone s eyes out not kidding don t use those in public situations back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo i love it because it doesn t break not at all and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc the great features are ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos this capo fits so easily simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches unlike the other screwtops or all other capos there s no need for any moving around adjusting the guitar falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar sheesh none of that nonsense you put it on and they ve engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on move it from fret to fret put it where you want and screw it in with great ease wow best ever in this category ease of use is tops ever it will never hurt you it only helps it weighs nothing is easy to carry you can slip it onto the peg area it just is so light i still can t believe how light it feels it does what it s supposed to that other capos don t do no issues with being in tune just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire no wrestling around like some capos do the screw is in the most easy location and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn t hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew it s a breeze no problems with the size it s so small it doesn t get in your way on the fretboard you won t have to do hand yoga in order to play capo d songs it is flat i know what a concept a capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords not pretzeled twister instead of chords now i play capo d songs all the time because of this capo and it is so much fun musically a whole new magical experience the truth i ve found is that good equipment matters in music making i never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until i got my first applause guitar with great action i have a yamaha i love now since the applause necks break but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that s easy to use in the case of guitars great action is imperative in the case of capos ease of use and no pain produced is imperative and it opens up the world of capo use the magic of the mathematics of music theory if you love the other brands don t diss me i know it s perfect for you and i m happy for you that it works perfectly for you because when you have the best one for you you will shine with your music and i will enjoy listening to you play but those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what i m talking about you won t settle for the torture of kysers and schubs gotta be kidding me i bought every capo imaginable need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile but ended up that i was using the old toggle type again instead until i found the aluminum silver planet waves capo planet waves has made the perfect capo now no more issues just easy fun playing capo d songs again only buy the silver model because when if you get silver you are guaranteed to get aluminum not thermoplastic guitar picks make a huge part of your tone especially on acoustic these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion they have a long life and do brighten your tone freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape not the best but not the worse this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar all the surfaces that make contact with your instrument are covered with rubber padding which is important only downside is there s no neck support i used this mainly for putting my guitar down when not playing not for displaying i opened the package for the first time and didn t think much of it but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job obviously cardboard isn t going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths i read the reviews here on amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn t expensive i only needed one and expected the package to come with just one but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise i ve had them for months now and they haven t failed me yet they keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and i had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor the only complaint i have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick and they are an extremely snug fit which makes me kinda nervous however i keep them as tight as i can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints
491	i give the product a star for doing what it is supposed to do i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period generously i ll give it stars something like this really should last at least a year or more cheap parts manufacturing cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature as an amateur musician i m always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such i thought this gadget would do the trick but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn t meet my expectations small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little i wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my sony and korg plug in tuners it clips onto the guitar easily stays put and is not intrusive by weight or size the bars are easy to see and are accurate not much to say about a chrome neckplate it s largely a cosmetic item but my old one with the serial number was corroding pretty bad and i liked the look of the new one a few people have mentioned that it s thinner but assuming you also have the pad underneath which you should that was not a problem for me at all anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws installation took all of minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before looks great
492	this is the equivalent to the shure sm except for a quarter of the price the quality is almost the same and in terms of recording they are pretty much the same as well there allow a more natural sound than the sm i believe and are thus a better product i prefer woven cables for looks they have a nice stage presence hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables i don t move around on stage so the feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer this cable is just a little stiffer than some i have but that s ok for me and i m sure it will wear well if you move around on stage bought this years ago it was a nice long cable that i bought figuring it d be durable but it didn t last maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig if i was better with wiring i m sure it s fixable but all in all it didn t last as long as i d hoped for the price this is a pretty nice strap it s thin but does the job well the simulated leather end pieces are noticeably cheap but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet i really like this cable it is a great quality cord that is very durable and i think it would be a long time before i would need another one the length is long enough for any need and the cable will obviously be around for a while these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too cable crackles when plug in jack is moved gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product this tuner works great easy to attach turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string is as easy as one two three i put this puppy on in minutes or less they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster they work like a charm if you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat this are a no brainier the price is right and they look great on your stratocaster i use this cable to patch my effects pedals together and it does what it needs to do the right angle ends make it easy to connect your pedals and keep them close together i like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere i use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar the right angle is nice because it s low profile and fits perfectly on my board even when i put it in it s travel case everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem it doesn t twist up like my standard black cable does but it will twist a bit over time love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn t just stick right out there if you really want to avoid on stage kinks then you must go wireless it is the only way to avoids twisted cables no matter what type you buy this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion it s worth spending a jackson imo the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package save your money and buy a better cable i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else
493	hands down the best cable i have ever owned i was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now i spend that money on other stuff i play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for or months well worth the money lifetime guarantee to boot definitely will buy mogami from now on this strap seemed a little awkward at first but after a rigorous six month evaluation it s become my go to strap i currently have it locked to a fender strat and experience no problems with the strap ends rubbing against the body of the guitar although the strap ends are light plastic they ve held up well the nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear the nylon isn t that soft so if you are that guy who insists on playing shirtless then this may not be the strap for you it will lock to most standard strap ends if the body of your guitar allows it i wasn t all that happy with this strap connected to a les paul a well built pedal of good quality with enough weight to keep the body stable and a good middle of the travel execution point for sustain with the correct keyboard the pedal will also allow for half pedaling very important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers especially older models this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment for most newer keyboards this doesn t matter as polarity can be edited globally or alternatively polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in some other pedals particularly those from name manufacturers will only work with some keyboards that said i feel this m audio compares favorably to it s most visible competition yamaha s fc offering the yamaha pedal is a bit heavier which i do like and subjectively implies better quality but in reality the yamaha did not last under the same circumstances breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road last the yamaha fc does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch making this m audio pedal a great all around option in my case this pedal has been on the live stage unpacked and packed tossed around a fair bit for years with no problems what is there to say if you re looking at this cable then you must have some knowledge of tone loss simple if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal buy mogami i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables but you will not hear a difference lifetime warranty and you won t be replacing it any time soon works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio all i own are mogami cables check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord goodbye pops and noise
494	i can now say i have used several others coated martins flat wounds smooth wounds exp elixir etc these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks their tone is slightly bright but not as harpsichord as the exp i am done experimenting these are the strings for takamine guitars the string are easy to play and sound great there is a reason they are used by so many professionals i ordered these for a gibson songwriter deluxe ec custom vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro touch longer than the stock pins from gibson the pins measure mm or inches in length i was going to return them but figured i would try them out in my gibson blues king l parlor sized guitar it was about the same result a little too thin smaller heads and slightly longer but i went ahead and tried them glad i did i didn t think that after using the tusq bridge that came stock from gibson it would make any detectable difference but i was wrong i can tell a slight difference i did not remove the strings just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it which were fresh from yesterday a small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable they also provide a graph in the packaging info but i think that it was a test using both the tusq pins and replacement saddle if you haven t changed your saddle do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one i must admit i did order these with about of dressing up the guitar in mind and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected i got both white with paua dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy i was seeking although there is no care taken as to match the dots for consistency they will vary in appearance the tusq pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar the heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher and i do wish that the tusq pins were the same size i will see how well they do on the blues king and most likely will order new pins for the songwriter deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two i don t expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion if in doubt consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the tone you have in mind be it darker brighter softer louder etc strings make a big difference and i find using d addario phosphor bronze strings very bright ringy last long are affordable and seem noticeably louder than ghs or ernie ball steel strings only does not apply to nylon or gut strings once again if you have a plastic saddle and or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference then again they might make all the difference in the world you just have to try them and see they are inexpensive and pretty well worth the risk i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new this pedalboard is very solid durable and easy to pack in their soft case which i love especially because it makes my pedalboard and some extras much easier to carry to and from gigs there is space below the pedalboard for cables to run and the velco and glue they provide to keep the pedals on the board are very reliable the mini is the perfect size for me but overall i ve been very pleased with pedaltrain in general wow wow i can t believe it working wonderful i m using it karaoke online in paltalk i did compairation with somes i have it s perfect vocal i connected it with mixer alesis input i wish it s built with switch on offrecomend to buyer thanks amazon i use this cable to patch my effects pedals together and it does what it needs to do the right angle ends make it easy to connect your pedals and keep them close together
495	wanted a way to plug in my boss me to save on batteries didn t want to drop the money on a boss psa so i got this one instead which does the same job just for less money the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone it now rest at bottom of a box what can i say this is a xlr cable i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables this one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road so buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest cheap works great for playing and foot controllers will not handle bulk dumps so i have to use a different interface for programming and backups this is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a mixer rack or piano scissor stand the square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading the mic end of the mount works pretty good overall the only problems i found is that the up tube could be to taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer
496	this pack rocks they have on off buton the quality feels sturdy and i had it next to shure mics that cost more but sound the same for karaoke vocals i bough two other sets and ft cables nice to keep your mic nice and fresh plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath decent value as i ve heard with the pyle pro amps i received mine today and it was defective only one channel worked and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep the packaging was very good though so i m thinking this looks like a refurb used and they listed it as new already printed the return shipping label and it will head back to the amazon warehouse on monday as the digital realm and the audio realm become one things like these will become increasingly rare you will always find a place that does not keep up with the times though that alone is a good enough reason to keep stuff like this around for now nice amp for the money but couldn t push a single peavey sp sub so i moved this amp to push a pair of dual s still had trouble getting the range that i needed so i have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single ev sub rated at watts it should handle it nicely bridged i will keep you posted
497	guardian well it is padded but i ve only gigged once since having the item with rehearsals held prior and i can say that the case is nicked up pretty good as they say in the south yes it will last because it is a guitar case but there s no way there s enough security to protect an instrument on a plane now that s for flight cases to handle but don t even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the guardian fails to guard against crushing your hardware this item is not one of the better cases out there but it does suffice and it does look good the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great say that now though after using it outside the house times and you d be a lying sob this thing is awesome i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it it has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar and one that restsin the case up by the headstock i ve been playing for about years and have always used a humidifier this works just as good as anything else keeps my case at a nice humidity i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too just to make sure you have the proper humidity level update so being the lazy guy that i am i never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hard well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gel like feeling so i am convinced that they work now i bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful out of tune twang with my previous planet waves capo when i would try to reset the capo on a different fret planet waves capos are awesome don t get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely these are high quality picks medium is my personal choice they did not disappoint me will buy this brand again it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt i don t use it for feedback i use it to protect it from the dust it fits tight but it s fine it barely did anything but i guess thats because im the one playing the guitar if you were in another room im am sure that it would make a difference works as advertised great at eliminating feedback in a live setting also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly i am user that likes behringer products i know is plastic but com on it s just what you should know about this pedal it s like the boss ch but a plastic version a durable one by the way it s good was having a lot of feedback and got tired of taping a make shift sound hole cover recommended it is good only thing i did not get was that it has the wire attaching it to the cardboard going through the feedback buster thing so there are two minuscule holes on there not enough you can see but still bother me a little gets the job done doesn t reduce sound worth a darn i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things muddies it up a bit maybe but not really a reduction in db this soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player right up there with a tuner string winder cutter cleaning cloth pack of extra picks and capo it s designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system which it does nicely it s also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly as in nights like that in a case this is a good product which i ve seen many people use however it s not for all acoustic guitars that little bit of info was missing from the info although i should have known in my case my guitar s sound hole is too small for this unit to be installed even though it s supposedly tapered to fit a lot of different sound hole dimensions didn t look tapered to me and i can t use it but then again it was pretty cheap and i may have a use for it some day check your guitar s sound hole diameter before ordering works well easy to install and take out helps greatly to control acoustic feedback i ve looked at these for a while glad i purchased it this mic is perfect it gets the job done sounds clear has settings on it clamps on your lap top
498	i know most budget guitars don t come with cases most not even a gig bag anymore that s the trade off i guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down even my fender standard telecaster came sans case and i had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gig bag as an incentive but even that was back in the day i had not looked at guitar gear in so long that i didn t think about guitar cases until i got the itch to get a new six string and came across these they look great seem well built i am not a professional touring musician and apparently do the job the exterior is covered in black tolex just like a pricey case and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price the storage compartment is adequately sized and there s a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched there are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case it fits both my mim tele andsquier by fender deluxe stratocaster maple neck pearl white metallicperfectly and i suspect it will do a fine job protecting them i will be picking up a tweed version for the telecaster to match up with the style and my lovely fender amp like i stated there s no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case background i m a gear head with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well before my current set up i played a fender strat run through my effects into a vox ac the vox sounded great but i had two problems the all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig at watts even though it was loud i d often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band and as the tube amp increased so did it s natural gain that would normally be sweet but it would color my effects with a different tone and often times leave me having feedback issues enter the fender frontman r this thing has tons of clean headroom and it seems like it was built for pedals i can crank the amp or keep it quiet and there is no tone changes done to my effects this is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom it makes it easy to dial in your sound every time no matter what volume you play at secondly it s fender reliable with a year warranty no tubes means no tube issues yes it doesn t sound as good as the vox by itself but that s why i have pedals other things worth mentioning it s not as heavy as my vox all tube amp i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another it s got x inch speakers they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too my vox had a better speaker but the inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down my vox may be a better recording amp but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year it sounds like it s behringer very fake cheap sounding phaser but it s all i need i got it mostly for that big airplane woosh and running it in the loop it does that fine the highs are kind of harsh but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame they are a wonderful product the lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar with these you can t go wrong i really dislike the switch on this thing it does not click that may not sound like much but i tend to rest my foot on a pedal when i turn it off this does not turn off when i do that this is unlike any pedal i have played i realize behringer is trying to copy the mxr but the switch substitution makes me wish i picked up a used mxr anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane i really like the other behringer boss type pedals though as the switch is what i like wish the phase came in a different case i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me it filled a hole that was missing since of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph classic side by side with the mxr there wasn t a hole lot of difference and with the behringer s added swirl switch gives you a few more options it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals i ve read a ton of reviews and still haven t heard of one breaking because of the plastic as far as value to money spent this pedal is again at the top of the list oh it also sounds great
499	the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set are the perfect balance between weight and confort it fits very well on my guitars fender evh wolfgang ibanez s the cons is that these do not come with vci so expect some flakes when you open the pack i bought many professional mic stands through the years before this item and i can not tell the difference well built made to last and looks great i highly recommend this item
500	whatever size you are looking for dunlop is the best option it lasts long sounds great and feels very nice it is probably the most favored pick among all companies i recommend the orange one for beginners and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well but it is totally up to what you want either way dunlop is the best and for a great price this is the best invention since the wheel as far as i m concerned it s easy to clamp onto my guitar head and the frequency not readings are quite accurate it s incredibly easy to use and very handy when re stringing a guitar there s nothing complicated about this purchase it s a cable it works it doesn t cost a lot it s a great deal get it i use it every week and it still sounds perfect then again i never mistreat my equipment put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier the tension is just right for soft finger style manouche jazz sleepy d jango i m a beginner and i try to learn to play guitar i was looking for many different capo s but this one was my choice base on other folks review is easy to apply small and sexy these strings aren t anything fancy but they sound great a good old standard that i ve used since i was a kid and this is the best price i ve found this tuner is easy to use i like that it has the input jack for electric guitar as well as acoustic it makes it so much easier this is my first tuner in a long time and i m please with it
501	solidly built works just as a mic stand should couldnt be happier as long as i take care of this ill never need to buy a new one again works well for my needs it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well a good buy i would recommend it for light to moderate use it works great for five of my lower power pedal type items including my line wireless receivers shure wireless receivers and several other pedals like my cry baby etc all at once however the transmitter for my shure wireless in ear monitor which requires less power than any of the other two items combined will not run even by itself when powered by the spot switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own and there is probably some little quirk in the shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn t get along with for most of my stuff it works great and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic arrived as expected very solid great fit it works i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy i would think it would work even better with a mic
502	these speakers worked great for months last week one of them wouldn t power up all the way the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them and it s just a matter of time before it stops working it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake i only use them between and hours per week i contacted m audio s online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops one on the east coast and one on be west coast i ve since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m audio support site m audio doesn t stand behind their products and i ll never purchase anything from them again i ve used these on the reg for a year obviously there are better sounding monitors out there but these are really great for what you pay for imo i d recommend these to someone trying to save some money updatetwo years in with continued regular use they sound just as good as they did a year ago i bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer that solution was successful these speakers put out enough power that i can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp i have a watt amp that powers a celestion speaker these monitors have watts powering a woofer and a tweeter w w respectively slight drop in the power output but they are beefy enough that i don t really notice the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless if you really need some get some more substantial pads the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours not really concerned about that but it s worth mentioning they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon i would really recommend not going to a retailer even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat they don t sound horrible i mean they are not computer speakers or anything the sound is very forward i would say harsh that s not uncommon among studio monitors there is definitely a lot of clarity here not a ton of bass but that s pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size there s a few schools of thought on studio monitors some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music others think they should sound more like a normal speaker these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this any flaws would be quite noticeable i previously used krk rp s so i can compare these to them granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors i liked them better than these they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in see if i could improve the situation but one of the speakers starts to buzz about minutes after it s turned on the buzz increases in volume over time i tried moving them to a different location turning the volume down even disconnecting the audio feed so they were only plugged into the power nothing stopped the buzz if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again the buzz starts up in more like or seconds so i sent them back i wasn t really impressed with the sound and i m definitely not satisfied with the quality control so i m going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead maybe behringer a s or something i think it s worth an extra dollars or so to get a full sized monitor sound nice but very unreliable bx a deluxe i own a pair of yamaha ns s and event s and they are all currently working without problems with over years use years ago i purchased a set of regular bx a s and they lasted about years and then the faulty capacitors leaked i just replaced them with the bx a deluxe model and after only one week one of the internal amps will no longer power up i need a pair of affordable av shielded monitors that i can depend on and these cheap m audio monitors are not it i am back to using my s with slight av noise until i find a decent av shielded monitor m audio was a much better company before avid took them over
503	wish i discovered these years ago comfortable and the grip works wonders nice clear tones with this pick tips thanks the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case the case i got works incredibly well and always keeps the guitar well protected and my back comfortable while carrying it it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too i d recommend it to anyone edit i ve had good years with this bag and it has still yet to rip on me basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion i have big hands which may be part of it simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capo this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use the c is probably the most universal of all the models this fits a les paul traditional gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar heritage cherry sunburst aprs se custom guitar grey black with tremolo bridge andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar vintage sunburstelectrics the primary use is for a laguna acoustic follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension it s key to not get too much tension we ve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo mostly it goes in a pocket once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesn t clamp tight on the headstock not a huge deal but a consideration for about yrs have been playing finger style only usually with alternating bass and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice for the song i was performing chords were bm e f m and g st rd position and i needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro i found a very old and very thin peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so i then ordered the fender abalone thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy fender premium celluloid guitar picks pack abalone thinmy ancient peavey broke in half not long after and i continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new fender picks to arrive because i liked the extra flex seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings but since i never liked using a pick at all the fender thin works best for me and i m enjoying learning to use it on songs like eric clapton s interpretation of bessie smith s nobody knows you i ll try the dava picks again later if i feel the need i play simon and garfunkel s version of scarborough fair which is exclusively finger picking and george harrison s here comes the sun where he uses a pick but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle this is all on an acoustic string steel guitar using d addario ej phosphor bronze light strings bristol by blueridge bd dreadnaught acoustic guitar natural d addario ej phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings lightfor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before the fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it s not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings the grip is better on the dava but they aren t going to flex as much undoubtedly better for more accomplished players most advice i ve seen says try em all and decide for yourself i was just amazed and delighted how much easier the fender thin made it for me to get started these are good picks i ve tried all the other gel pick s and plastic pick s the gel pick s come close but these are great because i have dexterity problem s and the plastic rubber grip is perfect i do still have a little trouble with controlled the pick and droping the pick but they definitely do help i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceased bad dexterity will work on any instrument you don t need the expensive ones this works just fine just wish the batteries lasted longer so far i really like these the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light medium the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out i doubt i will lose them my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand it comes with a cord that has a standard inch end i plugged it into a small guitar amp they use it mainly to sing along with their cds mp s note that this is not really a mic i would use in my studio it is more of a toy to be honest but a quality toy for a young child in that regard i give it five stars in an attempt to see what s new in the pick industry i decided to dive in and give these a go they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can t compete not only were they too flimsy but when i played with any aggression heavy rock based material the picks would fly out of my hands this was a huge disappointment i love the concept and design of these picks save one flaw the rubber gripping goes down too far on the pick i don t know any guitar players that have their thumb on the entire pick and since it goes down so far it s hard to pick clean without hitting the rubber on the strings sometimes i do love how they bend in the middle and the grippy rubber but i think they should scale the rubberization back a little bit good grip but too flexible and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks probably good for strumming but not good for lead i have always had trouble holding onto picks my fingers just couldn t do it for extended play nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body lol i wish i would have thought of these they were just what i needed they work great i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great they don t move around in my hand i have yet to drop one and for the first time i noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar these sound great i ve found a new favorite pick this strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product well made and sturdy it would be hard to beat i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar the rubber makes it easy to hold onto and i feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well i have no complaints except when i try to tune my guitar a half step down there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but i have zero clue how to use them this tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head swiveling head visible from wherever you are excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well this is the second clip on tuner i have bought this is much better than the other brand i have it s easy to use and see the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite the built in tap metronome is a cool idea if you re shopping for a tuner give this a try at less than it s a fantastic buy this metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it it is so durable filled with options very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician
504	and that s a good thing i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a no brainer there s not much i can say that hasn t already been said except true bypass is nonsense if your tone sucks when a device is not on then the problem is somewhere else not in the effect if you want to talk about unity gain on the other hand i m all ears these days on my pedal board i have several mxr micro pedals they have slowly earned their way on the board and eventually pushed some expensive boutique pedals into early retirementthe mxr mirco chorus is a perfect one trick pony it does one thing beautifully and simply and that one thing is create a soft velvety chorus effect with good chime tones when i activate the mxr custom comp pedal in conjunction with the mxr micro chorus i can easily copy the andy summers police sound and a few other notable chorus stylesnote it works great with distortion and with clean compressioni never have to bend over and adjust a bunch of nobs in the dark simply control the one speed nob with my foot on the fly quite simply presently i use these mxr products the mxr custom comp i highly recommend this very subtle very professional compression pedal read any review of this pedal you ll see why the mxr micro flanger easy sounds amazing never have to bend over and fiddle with it does jet airplane to subtle wavesthe mxr micro chours easy soft sounding with good chime never have to bend over and fiddle with it simple foot controland the old standard ive had this since the s the mxr phase simply the best phase pedal ever made and i ve tried them all i can now say i have used several others coated martins flat wounds smooth wounds exp elixir etc these are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks their tone is slightly bright but not as harpsichord as the exp i am done experimenting these are the strings for takamine guitars i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality thank u guys excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning well designed and rugged construction i believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least more one button operation makes it simple to operate i love this tape for multiple reasons one because when it s on it s on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around you can take it off it won t be easy but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off i was able to get everything off my older board and it came off so clean i was actually able to sell it so this is some good stuff be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals as it hooks to itself so you ll go through it pretty quickly the main reason i bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics is because i had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop a that is a must i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree i ve used other tuners when i happened to not bring this one along and thats been my experience also its easy to read which note you re on when you re on a dimly lit stage i have a fender hod rod deluxe and though it s got the formel electronics mod still needed a nice touch this guy filled the need using the effects loop no need of volume or gain the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur i ve never owned one before this i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect i d characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz maintaining enough definition for chord work if you re reading the reviews you ve probably already done your research on the features but i ll cover them anyway three simple controls volume tone sustain with the sustain control being more or less a gain control the enclosure is a smaller pedalboard friendly size the pedal incorporates two of the supposedly most popular big muff mods with switches tone and wicker when tone is switched off the tone control and its tone shaping circuitry are completely disconnected in this mode the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly and it also produces a significant volume boost the tone knob does nothing when wicker is switched on it removes three high frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original big muff circuit to smooth out the sound disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher with a high end frequency boost i use this pedal running into a mild overdrive the catalinbread dirty little secret which conditions the signal i play with the tone off and wicker on and even with the volume and sustain controls set fairly low this combination results in a wonderfully thick massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth if you re looking to get a big muff and you re not a snob about which version the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound not to mention that at this price point it will be much cheaper than some vintage muffs highly recommended this is my third purchase of this tuner all three work perfectly very easy to tune my basses one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass the other are for me one as a backup the reason why i gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post i may have to tape it down to keep it in place the other two tuners don t have this issue still it s the best around buy it these are the original perfect fit on my american deluxe strat so durable i got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful d good stuff once you place the pedals on it it s kinda heavy but it won t hurt your back i arranged pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly no brainer built to last and the carrying case it s outstanding cheers i think these jazz picks are awesome nice and light with a gripped texture so you don t have worry about them flying when you solo i only wish that more came in a single pack yes it costs considerably more than the sm and i m not sure if i could pass a comparison test between the two but i love this mic to me it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the s i have used in the past if you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet get the if you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost go for the beta i would buy this again no other choice on the market imho this is the one to get i have two and would buy again if i needed another one monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price it s flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable it s much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables for the money it s really hard to beat i won t waste money on the more expensive cables again it is simple accurate takes up very little room and has several modes that are nicely backlight to top it all off it s about half the price of any other pedal tuner korg king of the practical tuner world only had it a few days but is working great and i like that it is true bypass price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on the default tuning display is perfect for me as i ve not been real impressed with some of the other top tuners out there imo you can t go wrong with this tuner very pleased i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa i don t think that many people would do this the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box it works for me i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp i like how with this pedal not only does it not have a heavy click when you press down but if you are playing in a dark room the led lights are nice and bright true bypass i m telling you get it i d give this baby six stars if i could my prior practice amp a vox was very nice but finally went south and required replacement i was looking for something with a great tube sound as most of the solid state amps that i ve used mainly fenders and line stuff just don t get there i was actually looking at the fender blues junior and headed to my local gc to check em out and listen side by side the first time i plugged a strat into this guy in the store i was blown away and that was with all of the jimmy page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store i ve gotta say part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a blues junior but the bugera actually sounded better the only one left in the store was the floor model so i grabbed it got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations it s solid and heavy it s still a small fry slightly bigger than most w amps out there but much heavier the construction is great i think i read some reviews that knocked the construction but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it s built to last the sound is even better at home without the gc cacophony adjustments are minimal but enough the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp i ve run my strat tele and taylor t through this i think the hard bodies get the best blues tone but i can get a really nice clean tone from my t the headphones sound great i was really surprised by this i would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones the price is self explanatory but that s really the part that blew me away this amp would sell for double the price tag i ve tried several different strings on electric and ernie ball slinkys are the only ones i really trust on all of my guitars the fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus but they sound great and are far less prone to breakage than other brands i have tried the s are super fast and easy to bend but i ve started using s more often on my strats which creates an even more robust sound they re an industry standard for a reason you don t need dollar strings great polishing cloth not much to say here other than it works and works well removes all the fingerprints and polishes my baby up like new after each practice or gig can t go wrong just picked up the korg pitch black from guitar center yesterday i use a snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise love the thing so far its accurate fast fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price i like the multiple display options and calibrations mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe great buy i am happy with it i got it in red as background i ve recorded many jazz performances and listen normally to electrostatic speakers and have a pair of electrostatic headphones as well as dynamic models these audio technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise that said they are more difficult to design well as the closed ear cups and back create acoustic interaction with the back of the drivers these headphones have a very open sound smooth midrange excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid and perhaps a bit emphasized bass they are extremely comfortable well made and easy to store finally the pricing of these fine headphones are not over inflated as are many high quality products highly recommended it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable it has good lenght between two plugs you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals
505	behringer perfect pedalboardi can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb from costa rica i recommend it thanks behringer this tuner is awesome and accurate very noticeable and what else can i say for the price best deal ever get it ps i use it for my base though satisfied thanks korg i bought this to replace a behringer uca the behringer performs very well for my use guitar in a home studio but recently it s become way too sensitive to interference i was getting noise from the nearby cable modem router network drives this noise was making its way to my recordings too for what ended up being less than twice the price of the behringer i decided to try this unit not only is it interference free it has a much warmer intimate sound it s usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win with no issues i did go to the lexicon website and get their driver though just to be on the safe side reaper had new entries for the device in the audio settings panel asio everything just works great first time i was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero latency monitoring on the device great unit i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail fender a sx s jtxk feet performance series guitar cable ig good stereo cable for guitar or keybord it s long enought i recommend it they said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you re playing up to three octaves but i could never get that feature to work properly from video reviews i ve heard on youtube this harmonizer does not even come close to the boss version but it costs about less since i am not a professional musician and i am just playing around with it it works just fine and you get what you pay for addendum i ve now owned this for a while and discovered that it can turn my six string strat into a bass by turning the balance knob all the way to the right and my pitch on the second from bottom position in fact when i record my dean edge bass onto the boss loop station and then record my strat on top of it using the behringer ultra shifter harmonist i cannot tell any difference in tonality i am thinking of selling my bass it has just become a needless expense needs the neck adjusted twice a year the strings are expensive and it is harder to play then my strat for the multi guitar owners i think this is great all i was looking for something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tone volume changes set up single coil and another line humbucker or p guitar and have the same volumes excellent and space saver sure there s a lot more options but not likely ill use just to make guitar switching easy good deal it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for variable key capability i haven t seen much more expensive ones with these features a great buy for the money the behringer us is well made the high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused it is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass mode i purchased the us specifically for the detune effect this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps the effect is particularly dramatic when outputs a b are fed into two different amps giving a nice room filling stereo effect i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects the pitch shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect about as good as i have heard anywhere when using both outputs it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp this makes the guitar sound huge the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses it won t make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony however it is handy for short solos i tried it in the key of g and got useful results the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals i have seen several speak ill of it but i m not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal there is quite a learning curve on this gadget but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the device one other observation this is more of a studio effect than a road effect there are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor i had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments the only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect detune for example while gigging in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect i m glad i finally decided to get it the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus the other effects are icing on the cake kudos to behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise also the pedal just started oscillating a few times i would have given the behringer us five stars if it kept working it tracked nice and didn t tone suck too bad the seller shipped very fast and i give them plus stars this review is regarding the actual product the behring us is a basic pitch shifter don t expect elaborate effects made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal goes through v batteries quickly so stock up if you use an a c adapter get a hum eliminator curse you cycle also run the us after the distortion for optimum performance other wise you are shifting the clean signal distortion pitch shifter chorus then out this pedal gives you a sweet string chorus sound and that alone is worth the bones the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there don t expect a octave bottom because it doesn t do that you will not sound like a thin lizzy dual guitar lead but you can get that bryan may queensryche meets the allman brothers harmonies in rds for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesn t advertise lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos i originally wanted the boss dd but after doing a side by side demo i decided that i m not buckethead and don t need a dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not no they do equal to my boss counterparts especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isn t stock boss i wouldn t take these on the road or anything without or backups but for recording and doing demos behinger is the way to go timed effects wise anyway they are made of plastic after all this tablet mount allows me to use my large toshiba thrive in live performance situations now it makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand i never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use
506	for the price i m really happy it s my first one i get and it s perfect i m learning how to use it and it s not as easy as you guys think well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours it s exactly what you would expect from behringer it works it s not great but it get s the job done i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but it s still pretty useful for less than i don t regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withdanelectro d fab ms delaywell maybe next time i give it a out of it wasn t this time behringer surprised me so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors guitar sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with use a plugin instead i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed this particular unit is not one of their finest products but i give them credit for the price point and effort someone will appreciate it but not me it sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as it s not defective but just not up to what i want cheap so no big loss if you want to have an interesting echo and repeat this is worth the minimal investment i recommend buying the multi plug power supply as it goes through batteries fairly quickly and you will likely be buying other pedals to compliment this one this puppy sounds fantastic the controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top chorus with deep and intense sound the controls are on the front as are the in out plugs so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs very reasonable pricing uses a v battery or v adaptor it has a retro look and an old school sound perfect love it makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy quiet power supply lots of cables and end caps and adapters for what you d pay for a single power adapter it s nice not having to dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play about the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters but i m sure you can find them somewhere good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply a simple affordable instrument cable i prefer cable ends that are formed not the type which can be unscrewed as there is less risk of breakage and noise cable quality is not high for professional recorded you ll something better but very good in general this does some fairly cool things to the sound but there is a lot more out there this would be great for a new person experimenting with effects this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm i liked what it did to live vocals vs an old mic i have that seemed to give everyone small shocks and probably cost way more in the day i originally bought this to check the hype out and can say that i will likely get more as needed instead of buying sm s i have not recorded with this yet but from what i heard online i think it will do just fine i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me it filled a hole that was missing since of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph classic side by side with the mxr there wasn t a hole lot of difference and with the behringer s added swirl switch gives you a few more options it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals i ve read a ton of reviews and still haven t heard of one breaking because of the plastic as far as value to money spent this pedal is again at the top of the list oh it also sounds great
507	now a days i just search amazon because they have always got what i want at reasonable prices this is no exception i am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my epiphone les paul custom pro to the guitar guy for setup etc this was was better then i expected it is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit in other words great all around i know it sits on a self with many other guitars when i take it in to the guitar guys so i am perfectly confident that it is well protected and it is lockable with key if you are looking for a more then good case for your epi lp just get this one you will not be disappointed also i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day no special shipping maybe it is my locations but that was great too well packed wow for the size this is amazing plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper nothing else to say it s great if you re in the market for one get it fits mxl cube mics perfectly sturdy and easyt to setup ordered two more rare to get items these days that exceed expectation these cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the usa i had one just like this with the neutrik connectors gave away as gift and now have two with the g h show saver connector option this makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price these cables are well balanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass they are well shielded look nice and handle well you could pay more for gold plating for slightly better corrosion resistance or for woven coverings to make the wire look cute if you want to i ve had this pedal for about five years i own a bunch of other overdrive pedals including the boss sd ts a klon clone and a bunch of diy pedals the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons first is the bass and treble controls most overdrive pedals only have one tone control the bad monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows second is the mixer out not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a speaker sim the gain sound is ok but what i do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive this pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state it s built like a tank can t go wrong for the price imo there isn t much i can add to the good reviews already out there that i read before purchasing these for my american tele but i will say i really like these tuners and i m very happy i switched to them high quality and great design the guitar just stays in tune now period attractive too with the fender f on the face of the locking knobs and not a big bulky look like i thought they may be before i tried them very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar if your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you ll like them or if you should go with a different brand go with it and get a set of these if your experience is like mine you ll be very satisfied earnie ball s guitar strap locks are great in my opinion the best there way over other brands like dunlop schaller and many others i have them installed on my les paul axcess and my jackson dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging you can definetely trust them to do their job they also look great highly recommended one of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the mxr carbon copy delay pedal designed by way huge founder jeorge tripps is a great analog delay for under using bucket brigade circuitry true bypass and a very simple knob interface the carbon copy is a very flexible unit utilizing the modulation switch you can achieve a slight chorusing sound like the flutter from old tape echoes which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot the unit has a small footprint like most mxr pedals so it is very pedal board friendly this is truly a great sounding delay so try one out what can i say first it s mxr enough said this company dunlop gets it right with the mxr line i was a boss guy but was never really happy with the delay or chorus from them i don t hate boss and use their super overdrive in my chain i already own a mxr dyna comp phaser pedal so i took the leap and bought this delay wow it s so much warmer than the boss side by side the mxr won hands down well at least for me it goes from slap back to space shot very easily it s a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use i m really happy with this and would replace it god forbid this pedal really hits the spot warm vintage analog slap back delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate which if you are a fan of johnny greenwood you will love i also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound with the modulation on and very short delay time sounds almost like a phaser i couldn t be happier with this pedal i have a les paul marshall class bb preamp ep booster analog chorus and carbon copy i used to get this annoying hum and feedback when i cranked the amp up even when i just plugged the guitar straight to the amp but those days are long gone now everything is nice and quiet i even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job i haven t noticed any difference in tone so far i was scared that the smart gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it s cheaper not to mention it has its own effects loop i don t understand how the noise supressor or the decimator could be better than this one i mean the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no i had sworn off chorus pedals years ago the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same not with the mxr analog chorus very musical and transparent i like the presets recommended in the instruction manual the stereo out is very cool for using two amps and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank and will last forever by the way this is the exact same pedal as the zak wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job not all of us are metal heads i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites this is one of the top delay pedals the pro s use it is super simple to use regen is how many repeats you want delay is how long you want the delay to be and the mix is basically how loud you want delay to be in your mix you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal from ain t talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the s there is also a little mod button which seems to add some depth to the pedal really makes it seem a bit fuller i like that feature alot d addario makes great strings this just where not the gages i was lookin for other than that i like this brand of strings this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range its warm and the modulation sounds great this is not a digital delay the echos will not be exactly what you play but that is why you get an analog delay so you hear the part just a little to the left get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun i don t have any problems with this pedal but for the price i would just go with the way huge aqua puss for an analog delay it s the tube screamer of delay pedals i use mine primarily to thicken up my tone and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board i have used it for situations that call for deep delay and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey i fall back on a ehx memory man chained to an anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the delays in experimentation sequences but when playing blues or thrash i use it as tone beef only low settings not too echo ey more like a bass d out reverb there are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal and it is a testament to it s versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres hey stop reading this and order it now i have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers including a few of the vox valvetronix series however this is both my first fender amp as well as my first true tube amp first some clarification is needed on tube vs modeling amp the fender super champ x is absolutely a tube amp it has one ax and two v s and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages however the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone which is what allows it to project different voices contrary to what some posters have written channel does also have some front end modeling except that the the model is fixed for blackface tone and controlled by a separate volume know no gain control channel offers different voice presets and of these model a variety of vintage fender amplifiers including the tweed deluxe bassman deluxe princeton and twin settings model a variety of other popular amps including the vox ac and marshall overall i found the available tones to be excellent unlike my valvetronix where i more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times i could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars one thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently you may have to adjust volume gain bass and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp however i found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component also the x does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or hissing you hear with digital modeling amps the tones that come out of the speaker of the super champ x are very rich and touch responsive as you d expect from a tube amp the amp has tons of high end sparkle but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume true of many amps the stock speaker which is fender s own design and has a ceramic magnet i believe is frequently criticized as a weak point however it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps or only intend on playing at bedroom levels you re unlikely to take issue with it the eminence ragin cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end but again the amp is plenty loud and full sounding for its size better intended for home studio use than most gigs but it excels at what it does that brings us to the effects section and the fender fuse software that works with the amp via usb cable frankly i m not a fan of most on board effects with combo amplifiers i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrive distortion the good new is that the on board reverbs which include spring room hall and a few others if you install them from the software are quite good you can also reassign the presets to different effects so if you want a flanger with a reverb you can have a setting for that if you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb you can do that too the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects but as i said while they represent a good value for players that don t want to invest in pedals i m more likely to use my boss dd than the on board delay and so on the build quality of the super champ x is largely excellent the grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of fender s more expensive amps the amp weighs in at pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top one thing i did note however is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting so i will have to be careful about that also there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better but overall the amp looks very well constructed i was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic but everything is mapped to vintage looking knobs and from a few feet back the amp looks just as much at home in the s as it does post overall i think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that i hope to enjoy for years to come i m only really scratching the surface of its potential but it makes great fender tone sound easy the fender fuse software could be a little more intuitive to work with and i wish there were a better way to know what each of the voice and f x settings correspond to without consulting a chart but it s a great little amplifier that s all the power you d need for hobbyists and studio recording and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well this is a great pedal very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board i also like the tone a lot bear in mind i like the more vintage tones it s not a crisp crystal clear tone like you d get with a digital delay it s got more warmth there s a great video on yt from proguitarshop com that demos it very well it s got great short and long delay very smooth feel and the mod switch adds just the right amount of modulation to your tone to make it a tad fuller this is not a bright sounding delay it can be a tad dark at times if you re not careful i use this for my long delay sounds and use another delay for short slap back and echo sounds it s a mooer micropedal they work well together too to get a huge fuller ambient type of sound going i put the mooer before the mxr in my chain i use all my pedals right into the front of my amp as there s no effects loop i hope this helps your decision if you like warm old school tones you ll dig this pedal put this on my cheap acoustic guitar and it looks so good i might have to upgrade my guitar not much else to say about it it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do just recently a few months back got my first tube amp wanted a good analog delay pedal to go with it i found that the digital delay pedals left something to be desired at least for my ears after a lot of research and reading reviews i decided to give this pedal a try all i can say is wow it has excellent sound quality very low noise while off it is transparent in your petal chain the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very well made it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable it has good lenght between two plugs you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals
508	i ve had behringer mikes before and currently have a couple of xm s which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm s i saw this three pack of s for in a hard case and couldn t believe it i hooked them up right beside the s and while there is a little difference it s not much the has a little more high end but it s easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass the presence is also boosted a little on the meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback for now i m using the matched s as the main mikes for our vocalists and keeping the older s as backups i bought the of these for less than the price of one sm although the shure and the b is better the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for i can afford to buy another pack for complete backup a wise choice for the budget conscious i ve been using and abusing pedal effects since the s running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years i said all that b c i don t want to come off as condescending i ve learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative you ll fry a boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except digitech which want plugs make sure the voltage matches a v adaptor into a v pedal won t power it checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the behringer pedals i use about six of them on my board see product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor i fried a bbe delay the same way happy effecting behringer sm slow motion effects pedalbehringer dd guitar delay effect pedalbehringer cs compressor sustainer ultimate dynamics effects pedalbehringer adi v tone acousticbehringer pb preamplifier volume boosterbehringer ph classic phase shifterbehringer us ultra shifter harmonist ultimate pitch shifter harmonist effects pedalbbe two timer dual modedigitech dgr grunge analog distortion pedalelectro harmonix micro q tron envelope follower pedaljim dunlop m mxr m distortion digitech rp guitar multi effects processor works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb joyo continues to surprise me this thing is all metal looks very sleek is true bypass and all around works well the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool the only reason i didn t give it stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch you can see the led on nearly every other joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look however it doesn t even show up in the product picture on amazon it wasn t a big deal i just drilled a little ish hold and it fits through behringer usually makes good stuff and this reverb is no different but what it does best is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb nothing else i wanted this for singing and i have the danelectro fab echo which gives a short distance echo but i wanted something without the slap back and this does what i want it for but not quite as much depth as i wanted but with the music i do not think anyone can tell if you want a good reverb that is above average with much depth then get the behringer rv not this the power supply i use is danelectro which is great i also have a godlyke that i use
509	this inexpensive pedal kicks ass provides everything from subtle spring reverb to vast cathedral like reverb the space setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note providing a strange harmony some people pick on behreinger because they re stuff is still cheap i admit that two of their pedals of the that i have bought underwhelmed me this one is a keeper thought i would give this pedal a shot since it was inexpensive and sounded really good in the online videos posted for it pros very good sound quality many options for echo to suit every individual taste bright blue flashing red for tap tempo led s stereo dual out in operation tape analog digital types of delay awesome guitar signal smooths out when engaged and class a bypass cons volume decrease by a hair when you engage the pedal signal becomes a little bass ier but it sounds good with the analog echoes batteries go fast get the adapter all in all it was worth the money comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it a lot of options available with this good sounding pedal i had fairly low expectation for a pedal but many people said it sounded very close if not better than a vintage boss vb considering i didn t want to spend x this pedal i can t compare the but can say it works very well it can do subtle low rate low depth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles the rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control or at least turning it up weakens the effect which i guess is good i might swap around the leads finally a non blue led is used which means it won t blind you when you try to adjust the settings being however the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even behringer s pedal and the hinge is a little less stable it will still hold up with moderate use however it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature which is a momentary mode i ve had this for days and i m so glad i bought it its basically a top end second delay with whistles and bells you wouldn t even think they would be on there i have had alot of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the second loop capabilities this is an amazing pedal delay flanger phaser tremolo pitch shifter all sound really good and completely adjustable only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time for the price this is a steal behringer rocks
510	i like this bag though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured it s a bit too big for my tenor uke it s most probably made for a baritone uke all in all a good value for the money it s kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already but i can t help it i like this guitar quite simply this is a really nice guitar is it nice no but for less than nice doesn t even describe it my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing the outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problem since i d read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly nope no flaws noticeable to me kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without it other reviews had complained about a too low action but mine seems dead on of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule but even so there s really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low some mentioned rusty strings not on mine the strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well and of course the guitar sounds good again maybe not good but at least good and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price so if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar you ve found it stop wasting time just click the buy it button awesome instrument it stays in tune and is fun to play the best that i ve spent in a long time after a week i m already playing songs and i m not a string player don t purchase this without buying a tuner i bought the snark sn uku tuner it s awesome too i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag i know it says tenor now that i look at it but since i put soprano gig bag into the amazon search i figured i would be getting only soprano bags anyway it doesn t seem much more then a normal gig bag yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not not sure how well it holds a tenor since i don t have one mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
511	it cannot be denied that the boss dd is a versatile effective product and it does exactly what it claims to do and does it well but i have a mixed relationship with this pedal on one hand it does so many things with reverse modulate analog settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings it s a versatile tool in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing one thing in a live setting you have to set it and forget it period the four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are un usable cannot be used in a live dark stage environment so when i m at home putzing around on my guitar the boss dd sits on my pedal board and gets used but when i have a gig it get s pulled from the board and the mxr carbon copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category the mxr carbon copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions so it gets used up there when the pressure is onthe boss dd is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment only if you go live with it good luck excelent product great quality and useful in many different ways i specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing since it can record up to seconds and it will not end unless you stop it this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos i also have it connected in a fxs loop with the mustang fender iv and it works just perfect in stereo mode the reverse mode rocks allows you to do great fading delay violing efect this is simply the best pedal i got since it s so versatile i do play metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ love it terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto y con una buen duravilidad hoy lo instalare saludos desde venezuela this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians
512	needed this cable to hook up my dean evo to a practice amp can t complain it s a pretty nice standard instrument cable that makes my guitar sound clean and loud which is what i wanted this thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner the leds are a little cheesy compared to the old one though but maybe that saves on battery life i don t know it gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking i m also glad i bought the one specifically for guitar bass and not the chromatic one this is a cheaply built cable it has basic ends they screw on but seem to come loose and need tightening frequently the only truly redeeming feature of this cable is it s tiny length feet i use it with my honey tone belt portable ampdanelectro n a honey tone mini amp in aqua so the cable has to be short the amp is on my belt i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele let me say three feet is short very short if you want to put the amp down on the floor you d better be a short and b siting right over it because when you find out how limiting three feet cable really is you ll recognize that you can only use this for one thing a portable amp close to or on your body i suppose you could use it to connect a couple of guitar pedals and not have too much cable but them again most connector cables are even shorter glad i have it only for the purpose i intended wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables not much to say it s a pic holder that attaches to a music mic stand and holds pics as advertised it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my music mic stands and it does in fact snuggly and easily hold pics well worth the small cost i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand i had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over this one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over small and sturdy i use it at practice and during our live shows you can t go wrong with this works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room now i sit in my chair
513	i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy a must for guitarists unhappy with it actually i already replaced them the method of attachment is poorly designed it doesn t matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions expensive locks too i got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks i have on different bass the fact that it is wide is nice as others have said you need to slide the padding down but you can t beat these for the money this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price one does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesn t know which in or output is actually making the interference but once you ve established that it s all good baby i ve bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags sturdy stable and reliable not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
514	i had some issues with my watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes issues not only continued but worsened hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes i eventually put back the original el s and that didn t help once i removed the tung sol ax preamp tubes and replaced the hum stopped sound quality of the amp was consistent quiet and back to par my experience with the tung sol tubes was very very negative they caused me to go out and buy another amp i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast i ll never buy this brand again this is what all distortion pedals are judged by adds thick creamy distortion enhances harmonics and maintains great attack and definition sounds awesome true bypass this is my second sm in years what s the difference between the and the the is made in mexico there is a noticeable difference in tone with the with the on off switch i did not buy that one if feedback is an issue in your practice space get the one with the switch otherwise opt out for better clarity i say go for it save wow very cool gadget and well executed this review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks i have not tried it with other stringed or non stringed instruments the thing is quick and accurate the display colors are bright and easy to read it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing in fact if you play a chord it will usually guess the root note of the chord it clips on easily and firmly it is very sensitive i find that i have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work but i can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune usually without having to pluck it again before i have it right as an added bonus in my case the color happens to be a great match for an epiphone sg g in cherry red not sure how to rate this tube replaced a chinese preamp tube in my champion and couldnt tell any difference in tone maybe it is built better but thats yet to be seen i did put a eh v in with the chinese preamp tube and did notice an improvement but the eh v only lasted five minutes and shorted out so i sent it back i ordered a ts v and am still waiting for it maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes time will tell having recently purchased an epiphone el i went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to graph tech s tusq material it is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with the top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the tusq bridge and pins the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional this was one of the best modifications i have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade i can barely wait i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice
515	this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile dj s for the price and quality i would buy two other ones our second week and all is well nice and quiet using speakon cables mono to each speaker to speaker for easy mixing xlr to xlr from mackie mixer to pylepro watt amp great value for the garage band and recording to the computer for publishing on web or using as a small gig amp think i will get another one for the stage monitors might as well go all in these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough mic great for all your needs i highly recommend them it works well hasn t broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned now if only all windscreen s were this sturdy i d be a happy customer these are descent quality cables great price i own many of these just a good basic cable love the price and they shipped quickly bought for home use bought the musicians gear gooseneck to go along with it for playing guitar while singing great mic stand for the price this is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand it holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce however the gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger as well as the tail end of the grip because if you have a certain kind of xlr adapter that is wider than the microphone you won t be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the xlr adapter first this mic stand is a great value this stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed i bought a few years back and it s still working amazing till this day if you re purchasing a mic soon you will need one of these stands just make sure that your mic comes with a shock mount because the stand tends to move a little but other than that it s a great buy there s nothing wrong with this stand but for the life of me i cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design works great and base is out of your way much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around if you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these they are well made and do work i would buy them again this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows smooth midrange and crisp highs for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production the sound is unbelievable especially at this price for under twenty dollars this pyle pro mike can t be beat one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam dr portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device the tascam d is known for this noise issue but usually not when using the xlr input i had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so i had to get another for my acoustic super simple to install and very sturdy once installed really great quality item it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up it s durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days
516	overall this is a pretty good stand it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights a good value if you have lots of stuff you need to hang on it i took one star off because the bottom part is kind of awkward fro holding up the guitar as the guitar strap peg is at the very bottom and is the only thing touching the bottom of the stand which make sit easy to fall and i ve had it fall a number of times i m just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider also the edges of my guitars are always touching as if there is not enough room for them on the stand this is a fine product any guitar player has hands strong enough to use it looks great on the guitar and works really well recomended ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure for me this stand is very well built not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price they don t touch the floor there are safety straps that hold my acoustic guitars fender ibanez and my anybody s guess antique in place without any difficulty so i don t have to worry about knocking them off or over it takes up very little space the biggest plus great harmonica rack for smaller harps very strong in the set when worn a must have for any folk player
517	my band was playing out one night i use an amp stand that was on the stage i really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve it s sound and decided i had to have one i started searching around and found this product the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen the musician s gear stand does everything i needed it to it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble it s light weight portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to lbs i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier lbs or less i have a collection of straps but not a black one this one matches the acoustic electric i bought perfectly the pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have i would buy fromthis company again thank you it s sturdy well made and cheap you couldn t go out and buy the raw material and put something like this together for what you pay for it i ve used it with a couple of amps and it ll handle up to say an ac without an issues i liked it very useful for connecting rack components between great idea in different colors i will buy it again although i never gigged with it i think this would be great for any musician who gigs with a x or a x combo amp i used this with various fender and line amps and it worked great for amplifying the sound would buy again if given the circumstance i needed some fretboard cleaner this is something i had not tried before i used it and i like it great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels very solid way cheaper than i saw in guitar center im very pleased with this stand i bought two i wouldn t consider this a backup mic i would consider this a professional vocal mic period this is a great mic out of the box it has a nice weight to it it sounds slightly hotter than say a shure sm which is why i like it so much i typically like to stand back from a mic when i sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well seriously i don t work for the company or have any ties whatsoever i m just a dude in a band trust me on this one one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs they can be configured as a master slave set up with a single link cable a inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per cm in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient the low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ i have run both aroland rd nx digital pianoandroland v combo vr the grand piano setting on the rd nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the b emulation from the v combo i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand s down bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances i use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you however once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument s volume and eq controls there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand first the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm to the floor not exceed inches i agree this may be relatively small but it s heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high it s easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended needed a stand to lift my pa mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use for this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation but it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting i took the lead from reviewer w jones and removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical and although my amp was more stable i still didn t feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting i am using at the lowest height and it is stable but i highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used i give four stars for great value at will suit my needs very well i d say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection i don t use them all too often because they re a bit too stiff though i m not a big fan of pedals at all i much prefer multi effects but that being say this is a great cheap pedal does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack although i have a pedal board with effect pedals there are additional effects on my amplifier i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button is sturdy and good for price
518	these are good for the average guitar player who doesn t want to much strain or pain on there fingers not the fullest tone but you wouldn t expect that with extra light strings the taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should you will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do i have the fender mustang iv and i would say the fender is a superior modeling amp but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get the bass sounds great and when i played here comes the sun on my acoustic i d swear the tone sounded like the beatles record the modeling sound is ok and they tell me there s a looper here but i d have to pay an extra for a pedal to access it oops there goes a star for the con job peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less i ll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels solid recommend this if you re tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music firstly let me address the adjustable backrest there s nothing adjustable about the backrest the seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesn t move the seat does it also does not adjust up and down as you would think an adjustable backrest should the backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this but the seat does adjust slightly forward and back presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem the footrest however is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest you re again limited to where you can put the seat in height range all this aside i am still giving the stool high marks because it s a fair price it does fold down with some extra dis assembly for transport to venues and i find it works well for me but for how it works for me you should know i wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap i found that no matter how i adjusted the stool that i was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so i use it now exclusively with a strap in this way however it s actually really nice because i can use the footrest or not at will and i can also stand up walk around and then sit back down at will without the strap though my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor at least in my mind s eye if you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool you do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest then you re left with several pieces to schlep not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day overall though i am very happy with the way this stool feels no more couch and kitchen chairs for me this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging if you need a boom simply add anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackand you re good to go in addition to being indestructible this stand takes up far less stage or studio real estate than a tripod type stand like theon stage stands ms tripod boom microphone stand and despite the relatively small size of the base it is far more stable than the tripod stands admittedly this stand is a great deal heavier so if weight is an issue you may not like this type even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable for outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright which is not always the case with the tripod types moreover there are no legs to break i have lost one tripod stand to that problem if you transport your gear often and especially if you play outside or inside on cramped stages this stand is the best choice in my opinion
519	its very useful looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand very durable as well i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices checked out amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price but pleasantly surprised when we received it works great it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later this package of picks is of good colors and good weight they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff i read several reviews before purchasing these strings i ve never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my yamaha acoustic it sounded great they have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar my yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is if you re wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings definitely give these a try the coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board you should find another review from me but suffice it to say i just won t skimp on my cables when i spend s on amps and cabinets for good sound is a good stand relatively small but is a secure the locking top is a good feature as well id recommend this over the larger tubular type i wind long scale bass strings onto my unusual super short scale scale six stringed bass instrument so i m betting i get more use out of this thing than about anybody this device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much much faster the cutter worked great too changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore can t ask for more than that i bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter as she is learning to play my son has also joined in the fun this is a pretty complex amp and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do it can be a little daunting for a newbie i have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what i want it to it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet turn in half way up you get a clean sound crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous i own a piece of the legend and music history not a whole lot to say about it quality materials works well love to keep my taylor on it but had to re case the guitar during our low humidity days serves the purpose i needed a stand at home and this does just fine i liked the price i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy it s nice for my son to be able to stand his five string bass up in his room on display while still having it be kept safe it helps him remember to practice when he sees it sounds great still suck at bending a buddy of mine got one and he s killing it on the bends we both been playing for about months great harp will buy another if it ever wears out it s nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play a lot of songs say capo preferred it helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on i recommend this product last week i ordered a guardian electric guitar stand a shape black price from amazon based on an average star review i read the reviews first and placed the order for a cheap collapsible guitar stand for my electric guitars and bass when i got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my fender jazz bass on it lol no way worthless and it s now holding my son s size classical guitar barely undaunted i ordered this musician s gear stand less expensive than the guardian it holds my gibson cs custom with no problem and i would trust it with any and all of my electric guitars or basses the bottom piece that supports the body of the guitar rotates and that s a little strange hence stars instead of but with a little care you can put a guitar into it and remove it with little or no attention to placement for you can t beat it jm tepper purchased for my epiphone electric guitar perfect has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo nice bag i really like it my guitar just love it this stand is exactly what i hoped it would be it is all i want or need from a stand i have bought three of these i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice they all work and none of them have given any trouble my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around a lot i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great no regrets rock on i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic but with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio you get what you pay for this is a no nonsense cheap guitar stand its adjustable padded and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you a stage groupie or your clumsy drummer trip on it the whole mess falls over this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar this is not a good choice for your prized jimi hendrix strat or eric clapton gibson es you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those great stand well made safe for ur guitar and practical w safety cord on top worth getting it this is one of the better stands out there cuz its well made and great cushined for ur guitar and with a great price my frist guitar strap i like it alot dose not cut in your shoulder or back will get aother one for nd guitar this makes the second one of this straps that i have ordered and i love them they are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself i don t have not one bad thing to say great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap what can i say about a guitar strap it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it upon close inspection the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe wall so don t expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off even if it is welded better than mine was just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs it is literally that thin of metal tubing for i did not expect perfection so to it s credit it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap since it was less that i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it i was able to carefully weld mine back together but this would probably not be an option for most the stand might work fine if you don t fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up but if you need portability and durability i would definitely purchase a better quality stand good product great price as long as you take care of them they seem as though they will last quite a while i actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new with no complaints for such a small combo this amp really packs a punch it is plenty loud and is just fine for smaller club gigs however you could use it in larger venues also since you generally mic up your amp anyway and get most of your sound from monitors anyway the clean channel is what you would expect from any fender amp with good tone and crisp reverb the high gain channel is really fat sounding i still use distortion pedals and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one but without a pedal the high gain channel performs adequately for the price this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion kind of does away with the need for a half stack unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors plus it is far lighter and easier to transport lol i spent a lot of time on amazon reading reviews comparing prices i wanted an amp that would have overdrive and i also wanted some power there are so many choices from the small portable units i was afraid they would sound like toys to the big units they would sound great but i couldn t afford them i am thrilled with the starcaster this amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it if you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image this is the one for you i am so happy with this amp i ve had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing on a couple of occasions i have plugged in my acoustic my mic and my buddies mic and it still handled the load and sounded good i m impressed i even have a digitech pedal that i use with my fender strat and it sounds amazing i highly recommend this amp love the holder and the picks looke great and nice and i don t have to look around for my picks when i m ready to play my guitar seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks a good moderately priced guitar stand i had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result i replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware store a good moderately priced guitar stand i would recommend purchasing it i store my picks in there and i put it by my table it s a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done just finished setting it up works perfect stout stable and even looks good it s holding a gibson les paul so it has to be trustworthy great price wayne just got this it is my first pedal of any sort it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with i just plug in my headphones and i am off in my own world when i play i can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever i want or at least get close to what i want i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didn t this is a good quality strap it is wide and has leather ends it fits my les paul just fine and i am sure it willlast a long time with normal use can t go wrong for the price i got of these for my electric guitars they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent do be careful when un folding as pinching of skin would be very easy the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well i have had no problem with the foam cushion so far i have modern finishes on my guitars i don t think i can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing my epiphone lp seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the turser strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include all in all these aren t bad not quite perfect but a good value for the money good little stand to hold your guitars they function well and are inexpensive the only downsides are that they are a bit light best to place them near a wall just in case you bump them also it seems that every one that i have ordered here and mf have had the foam a bit crushed up simply could be the packaging from the manufacturer though do not use these or any other foam for that matter on nitro finishes good product at a great price does its job just fine simple and kind of cheap looking and its hard to balance if you have it on a rug and not even a thick rug i have a thin rug and it still is unbalanced but hey its not really meant for rugs so i can t complain i use the dunlop mm nylon picks as my current standard but decided to give the lighter mm a try unfortunately the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar especially in an outdoor picnic setting and basically unusable for that purpose however i did find these were just the ticket for personal practice allowing me to hear a metronome or backtrack far easier so although they failed my original performance intention stars for filling a need i didn t even know i had it s cheap light simple and does its job not sure what else you could want out of it i m more than happy with it but just don t know what else to add it simply works bought two of them about a year ago and i m still happy with them i am a beginner and wanted a set that i can learn on but would also allow me to experiment with other percussion instruments besides a rock drum set and would take a small amount of room and allow low volume levels i ve had this set for about a month and a half so far it is working well for me the rubber drum and cymbal surfaces are great for keeping the volume low enough when playing late at night each drum and cymbal seem to have sweet spots where i imaging the triggers are depending on the devise hitting further from this sweet spot might change the sound and or volume produced the impression i get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another so it seems to be whether the problem s are something you can live with or not also you can t play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that i can enjoy it and feel like i m learning the drums it takes up very little space compared to an acoustic set which is great for me since i have little room for it there are a few problems that i m not likely to encounter until i become really accomplished one is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hi hat or tom simultaneously one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about half the time i found this out when playing these combinations rapidly which i m not likely to do maybe ever but it is still an error in functionality i called alesis and they said this was a common characteristic of this model drum set there is a firmware update that has been mentioned in earlier reviews that i but it didn t make any difference in summary for the price and my needs i am very pleased with this drum set more expensive sets with more sounds and better nuance control don t have the rubber surfaces that i want plus according to reviews they all seem to have problems of some type so spending more money doesn t necessarily eliminate problems
520	this is a great item because it is small lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere guitar mic stand etc at the same time because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don t pack it carefully when traveling etc the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong the clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than sheets of paper on the clip board this doesn t happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig day etc for this price it s a good buy in my opinion and with a little care you will get more than your money s worth out of it this doesn t look very robust i expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in ft of it consider it broken the swivle hinge is secure and will hold it s position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weak the backing board mine came with is about the size of a full sheet of paper make what you will of that and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a risk overall a reasonable value and i m glad i bought it it is what it is works works as expected and should last a really really long time glad i bought it havent used this one yet i got it to run to my pedal board for those stages where the backline is not easily accessible seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general i love a lot of danelectro products but not really this one i give it because it works as advertised the features are good true bypass requires a v wall plug and adjustments are good but here s my issue the distortion is not crunchy it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional it has no depth to it thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres but i play a lot of blues rock i ended up switching to a vintage tube overdrive by behringer not for me maybe for you
521	works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking works great easy to use cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way it is very safe for guitar finishes i bought this to tote my pod hd around it fits snugly but well the accessory pocket can fit the power supply and the plastic line expression pedal the shoulder strap makes me feel important it respects my arm s desire for freedom of movement my only qualm is that it s gator brand and gators remind me florida i d rather just pretend that florida didn t exist defiantly a space saver i can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables it s very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits my only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much well i found the lesson very good and worth the money i payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great right product at the right price i have of these dang things layin around cause i never throw them out but never fails i need one i don t have to drive a zoom pedal to save on batteries and here it was nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn t work well that s not the case here this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied i guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration but why go to all that trouble this product lives up to it s calling besides who wants to keep changing batteries in the stobe tuner planet waves when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget i gave it a star rating because the price is fair the product is well made and works and it was shipped well within the promised time by today s standards that s as good as it gets dp i have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road i have not had this long enough to know if it will but so far so good these are exactly what the doctored ordered i have one setup to mic my guitar amp and another setup to mic my voice for doing guitar video exchanges they are excellent quality for the money a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item i bough for my primo and he really loves it from the moment i started using this i noticed a radio signal overlay when used with my mini amp and headphones if you haven t used these picks get some they are the perfect size and shape your really can t beat them i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new i bought this eq pedal to use with a s amp project i replaced the speaker and needed some mids so i bought this pedal to use for a clean channel the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box i have seen the f c be called pure gold in a plastic box on a telecaster forum and read reviews all over the net saying the same thing the eq works wonders for tone and is priced less than it s mxr and boss counterparts i am not going to rehash all the other reviews but i use it with a bass guitar amp and it works surprisingly well with the old amp and a passive bass the boost combined with the low bass eq s works wonders for low end i use a boss ge eq pedal with a different amp and the f c works as well as the boss as long as you don t mind the cheap construction from danelectro i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesn t matter to me i am wondering how long the switch will last though but at this price who can be critical some danelectro pedals can be sorted into the novelty realm but this one is actually very functional and can open up all new sounds i also tried the eq with a telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end i hope this lasts as long as my old all plastic fab distortion that i bought used for i already liked the jazz picks by dunlop these made from the ultex material sound so much better and the surface of the pick is nice even with sweaty fingers they stay put i do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick sweet these are clear yellow picks i would love to see them in red that would be brutal instead of shelling out over for a line a c adapter for my pocket pod i decided to give this one a try out and i m glad i did it s well made works great and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process can t beat this one for sure i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers thus far i am very pleased some of my guitar effects require at least milliamps which this adapter handles with no problems i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either it does its job reliably and well i would definitely recommend it to a friend works well with every pedal i tried so far can t ask much more than that from it it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon go for it if you need one or i buy and sell electric guitars and often i meet with someone at a half way point where access to electricity is unavailable i was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small there is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter i bought a planet waves v power adapter to go with the honey tone it might work in a busker situation been using this brand of strings since i ve always been pleased i like the super slinks as well love um this bag is made well enough if you are careful it offers good protection you can t rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly can t stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc if your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag otherwise it s a good bag especially at this price
522	this works well a few cons it is not variable speed on off in either direction with full torque not so bad but variable speed would have been nice it is a little loud other than that does what it should as expected i m so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool i ve been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill the reason i never did was that i was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose this is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners i love it this mike is an awesome value you could pay twice or three times more and the frequency response is excellent service was super fast i would ve no problem buying from these folks again in the future
523	stars because i ve only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode stamina mode is supposed to run for hours perhaps it does but if so it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode no one records hours straight so i m guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner if not for that i d have rated stars in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent the auto rec level is very smooth and doesn t sound as if has been severely limited and squashed at rehearsals before the whole band kicks in the levels are quite loud but it comes down quickly and smoothly in terms of the other features i cannot comment this is a very useful and quite educational musician s piece i especially like the way it is presented and how easy it is to use it easily helps remember all possible scales and shows many tricks for your musical compositions highly recommended cheers i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive this works great for mic ing guitar amps the stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp indeed this little blue lighted wonder will make you famous not unlike the three wolf moon shirt this little pedal will get you the ladies or if you re a lady it will likely get you the guys either way it gets you what you want on top of that it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of oomph in particular i find it helpful when i m running a lower output guitar through a long cable did i mention it has a blue light the only downside is that you have to open up the back with a screwdriver so put that on your shopping list if you don t have one to adjust the little switches that chance the tone really cool looking and are nice picks for the the eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick great deal from amazon thanks i will definitely buy more of these in the future
524	i got this duet instead of the single light version as most kindle users do so far i really like it cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read even better than day light the only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflection the ac adapter is a great money saver as i usually read hours at night and burning up aaa batteries each night is not really a solution if you have a kindle dx i would strongly recommend this duet instead of the single light version cuz there s almost twice as much screen to cover of course i also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the kindle it s a versatile light source and i really like it a lot have not used the light as much as i thought i might but it works okay each light has multiple independent settings the beams are narrow but you get two of them the major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag something in the bag will trigger the switch and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it there is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transport also you cannot really tell from the product picture but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects it does not work well or at all with object more than inch thick this cable is perfect great sound quality and durability i will not buy any other cable except planet waves best bang for the buck for any working musician hands down yes there are cheaper cables but they don t sound as good or last as long planet waves is the way to go i love the dual bulb design the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand overall i like the design and flexibility accidental turn on in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem i m sure i ll need to find a way to protect the product from breaking since it seems like it would not stand a chance on its own in my gig bag nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls gave some to my guitar teacher and thought they were the hoot a pick is pick there s no doubt about that but a little art work sort gives it a personality these strings fit the bill perfectly for my desired sound from a yamaha lj acoustic guitar which has been doctored with bone saddle pins and nut when i decided to put the money into the guitar it was my belief that the elixir strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that i like so much in the lj and after all the work was completed that proved to be true to form i did move to the medium for a little improvement from the bass side and it s a most outstanding sound from a medium price hand crafted guitar elixir has the best most comfortable feel to me of all the strings that i ve tested and these provide the best for my liking sound on this guitar try them if it s quality sound that you re looking for these are great this capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no fuss with positive micro action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose removal is simple also just press the release tab and it s ready to remove no muss no fuss it really does work that well highly recommend this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely the light from the leds has a blue tint to it i d prefer something more white each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting i gave starts because it doesn t get quite as bright as i d like but it does the job it seems well made and will operate off battery power as well as an ac adapter which is included i already own amighty bright led book light with one lighting head but i bought this light as a semi permanent fixture on mydocument book holder which is mounted on anarticulating arm took a little diy ing this music light has one drawback it doesn t have a master switch to turn on both lights you would have to independently turn on the switch atop each light head two switch presses to turn off both lights you would have to independently double click each light head four switch presses the first press brings the light to a lower level and the second press turns it off each light head has two light levels bright and medium bright for a total illumination combinations i use this light for music sheets documents and books the mighty bright label is no misnomer to be sure these lights are mighty bright they provide more than enough illumination to make even smaller texts readable in low ambient light conditions each light head provides very even illumination for a letter size sheet the light starts to get dimmer just beyond the fringes of the sheet so two light heads will provide sufficient illumination for a good sized area it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books the flexible goose necks of the music light allows you to easily position the lights to reduce glare which is inevitable on glossy or semi glossy pages this music light is a mighty sweet deal because it comes with anac adapter which doesn t come with the book light with a single lighting head and has to be purchased separately the adapter works on both this music light and the book light with a single lighting head contrary to the product description this music light does come with aaa batteries at least mine did important note if you switch from using batteries to using the ac adapter the aaa batteries will first have to be removed from the battery housing or the light s won t power on i picked this music light over themighty bright orchestra lightbecause i ve had my single head book light for many years and i trust this book light to offer the same durability both lights are indistinguishable save for the single dual light heads two goose necks offer more lighting flexibility this music light is about half the price of the orchestra light the bottom line the lack of a master switch on this music light makes turning on off the lights somewhat of a hassle an unfortunate but tolerable drawback all the same this music light is very functional and as far as durability is concerned i m quite confident that it will last me for many years to come it has the same build quality as my mighty bright single head book light which i ve had for many years recommended i love this light it runs on electric so no need for batteries the goosenecks are metal and well made and the led lights have switches that can turn on single or double leds on each side it will clip on anything you want to hold it it s simple well made and works great
525	i expected this to be a good mic but it s amazing how much different the quality is over your standard desk mic i decided i wanted to hang my guitars on my walls instead of having them take up space via floor stands just find a stud and drill in the screws they ll hold just fine i m really bad when it comes to stuff like this so i had my brother help me just make sure you know what you re doing because i thought i did when i really didn t at all the wall hangers look really nice in person and they keep the guitars held in place very nicely safely the only thing you should have to do extra after purchasing and installing these is creating a makeshift wallpad for behind where the guitar is hung if something happens that makes it hit the wall it won t damage the guitar or the wall this is as legit as it gets if done right though i ve had my guitars hung via string swing for months and i ve had no problems or concerns i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands it saves room and makes the room look cooler i don t know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case this one surpassed my expectations months into using the gig bag and not a single problem the pockets are packed with books tools and strings the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze this guitar tuner is simply amazing i feel like i should have paid at least bucks for this thing but is practically a freaking steal the display is so nice the quality is amazon and this thing is beyond accurate never using another tuner again in my life snark forever this microphone s quality is amazing i just hooked it up to my pc windows and it worked no hassle whatsoever nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great i recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises the stand that comes with it is very stable but it is low to the ground or in this case desk table so it may pick up some unwanted background noise computer fans mouse clicks movement etc especially for the price this is a great buy the strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when i would slide up and down the fretboard and i was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too the only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren t shining like they use to i just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure i wiped it in off as thoroughly as possible which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as i went from fret to fret not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing the ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever take minutes and do you and your guitar a favor i don t think i can say enough good things about the samson sp shockmount long story short i was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago i did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording a shockmount is an absolute must especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface the build quality is fantastic i just recently purchased my third shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast what i ve grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone i can get my hands on if you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount nearly all do but some companies like blue snowball snowflake etc are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts i have used the mxl usb with this shockmount as well as the at usb and xlr version the mxl fit like a glove perfect the at once threaded in seemed just a bit loose so i added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer it made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement in short i haven t found a better shockmount for condenser mics the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand fantastic buy two of these thanks samson now just make better mics works great small and easy to place to the side and out of the way simple setup plug it in change the preference settings and it works i bought this microphone for youtube podcasting and it does a really perfect job the quality is great for me it was what i had expected it to be i also bought a desktop mic stand with it as well as a shockmount and popfilter highly recommended
526	in life you mostly get what you pay for this stand really isn t an exception getting what you pay for though doesn t mean that it won t do what you need it to do this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it the great thing is it doesn t need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do it s a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case for a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play you now have no excuse for your expensive or cheap guitar to get beat up from laying around these wires definatly change the sound of the snare drasticly improving sound as well as looks very satisfied with my purchase they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so we ve been using remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from classic rock to speed metal great quality very durable you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed it s a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it don t fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friends well constructed awesome price
527	first i have to say the only reason i bought this is that we have two pot belly pigs that live in our house so this was a no brainer to purchase just to have as a fan of pigs and i play the guitar too now for the review this little collector amp turns out to be something i will actually use rather than put on a shelf to look at with all of our other pig stuff i was very surprised how well built it is it s solid as a rock with chrome handles edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control it looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review the ac adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally it also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic okay i keep getting off topic here the sound is clear and crisp for it s size sure it s not my fender mustang iv but i didn t pay bucks for it either but then my fender doesn t have a pig s snout there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob but most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway i would compare the sound coming from it as above average but it s the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction for me anyway as for it s size i would say it s just about the size of your average small jewelry box but it s much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that it doesn t have that cheap feel about it like i said i will use this occasionally especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van i look forward to the comments the amp will get i m sure way more than my guitar playing skills as i still have a lot to learn but learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun in summary i would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone who s looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an ac adapter a word to best describe it cool it is a string winder what more can i say it works as it should and saves time very useful when restringing a guitar this portable volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone it s way louder than a volt fender mini twin which actually does incorporate two speakers however when you dial in the gain all the way you get a crunch rather than full on distortion it comes included with a volt and is compatible with most negative tip power adapters make sure its ma like the planetwaves adapter for at this amp is a deal i was going to get the plate with the big f on it but i read complaints that it was very thin so i kept looking i took a chance and got this one and it was a good call this one is very thick and solid like it s supposed to be great product great price these strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned i bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand the owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup i like the lighter sounds out of them and using a capo makes them sound great also these seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of ernie ball strings and i am planning on trying them out on another guitar soon they seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well i use them on an electric acoustic and i am happy with the sound when i play through an amp
528	very beatiful and good quality nothing bad to say it s a fender strap with the hard rock leather look highly recommended i have not tested other micro amps this does for what i bought it for to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport it s very portable to take with you i really like the overdrive sound the tuner works really well i dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel but overall its a great product so if you need a good tone and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try it s great normally i prefer a harder pick but i switch to these after pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors these super light flexible nylon picks are great if you re trying to play quietly if you prefer a flexible softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick this orange micro crush amp lives up to it s name it s little bitty about a third the size of the roland micro cube but it s plenty loud surprisingly loud really it s amazing that much sound comes out of that thing of course it doesn t have all the bells and whistles of the micro cube it s basically got a clean channel an overdrive channel and a tuner then a volume knob a tone knob and that s it the over drive gives a good sound but i like to run pedals through it anyway it s missing reverb which i would like to have but it s far from a deal breaker i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock of course it s size and trademark orange color make it look like a toy it s definitely a capable little amp definitely a keeper
529	i don t play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as hardwire ht polytune or korg pitchblack i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner i narrowed it down to korg aw snark sn intelli imt all have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under i visited each manufacturers website for more information and found out about the snark sn snark claims that it s their best tuner yet if their sn can go toe to toe with the others then i would assume that their best will do even better i took the plunge and ordered one i have only requirements for a tuner it should be accurate it should be fast the snark sn delivered on both counts and more it came with other extras like tap tempo metronome super tight tuning pitch calibration transpose features etc i may not have any use for all of them right now but it s nice to have them at your fingertips you can use it for other instruments as well but i only use it for my guitars the sn is small unobtrusive the display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case i don t like it hanging in my guitar of course it doesn t stay long because it tunes fast for under these little tuner is all you need fast and accurate try it you won t be disappointed this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing that s why it s so inexpensive what you see in the picture is what you get but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge it was incredibly easy to install and the sustain is improved one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge the springs in the back keep it back the string tension keeps it balanced in the front what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal right at the upper lip works well for me the bass cut and presence boost are convenient use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids flat s where it s at flat sounds most natural being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might though it takes eq well and you can eq that in if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix so what does it sound like the sound is very natural and true to my voice it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic this thing is heavy and rugged the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one but since my room isn t perfect this will do the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser it really does of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well seriously a db shelf in the highs another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest the cm is magnificent it produces beautiful overdrive one that doesn t destroy your guitar s tone it has independent high and low tone controls and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes thus allowing for great versatility in tone manipulation it features a switch that allows you to pick between classic overdrive and an extra blast of distortion modified the case is made of metal it comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal this pedal will not give you metal distortion for that consider digitech s tl instead it produces a warm old time overdriven tone i love this thing
530	this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price i used this on my wall mount u rack to hold my modem and router near my switch as an added bonus it has vent holes on the bottom which not only allow for heat dissipation but also make really convenient ziptie tie down locations i ll definitely be buying more of these my musician friends notice and wish they had one as a flute player i whet my whistle so to speak a few times during a performance and this keeps my water bottle near by the cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups i imagine it would hold beer too works great sounds great it s a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate tascam rocks this is the american dj micro galaxian red green laser it is the smaller version of the galaxian laser with the same laser power output but a smaller beam spread it is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool the small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord it comes with a remote that works great but has an antenna to pull up if needed which seems like old technology the remote has buttons which allows you to select auto sound mode blackout color and direction of rotation when going through the color modes you can select red green red green together or red green changing and flashing you can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music there is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely move very fast or slow the darker the room the better but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on i am very pleased with it i havent tried it with fog but i know it would look great since it has beams it will work great for any dj to use on the dancefloor wall or ceiling this is a great buy under pros it is small bright well built and works great it has a remote to control it cons transformer on cord and antenna on remote i put it on the boom of my mic stand tight on some not on others i need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place
531	bought this in early march this year have it in line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board no problems with it at all it works as advertised i ve found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my fender g dec amp so what does that tell you not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because i love mine for the money you can t get one that touches it so what if it s not that means you have more green stuff to buy other things since buying this one having it work so well i now own a couple of other behringer pedals i seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i ve been playing guitar for like years these picks are the bomb they don t break on you when you strum too hard fast d i would rate this product stars if i could i m completely satisfied with these picks tip these picks are great for high action high gain guitar solo s this is a very good pickholder by dunlop and looks much nicer than the regular dunlop or it does what it should and looks more esthetical than the dunlop or versions it does not hold more picks than its predecessors and it actually holds a couple of picks less it holds some or maybe picks while the holds around if you use gauge picks or lower i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks since i use the planet waves chrome dome stainless steel picks joe satriani i only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one i am playing with so for me it does the job perfectly i have a nice paul reed smith custom with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top so i needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it the adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitar s top if placed as instructed place it gently no need to press it too hard alean the surface very well before placing but do not use carnauba or any polishing material or gel before installing just regular guitar top cleaner i use the prs cleaner for example cheers i love this little device i m an amateur musician so i m on and off on playing i play enough i need to know theory but not so often i don t forget the specifics this gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tab i don t believe this is a tool to teach people music theory but it is a wonderful reference once you know what you re looking for for example i m playing with the harmonica now simple little instrument right well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major minor major pentatonic minor pentatonic and blues scales in different keys one section of this wheel lists all of these different scales rotate the dial to the key you re interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key you ve selected appears nice although i play guitar i find the other side of the wheel less helpful yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords mmmmmmd but they are barre chords based upon the e chord if you understand the formation of an e barre chord and its family e em e esus esus etc this may not be so helpful i really don t use e barre chords much beyond the fret as i usually switch to the a type barre chord based off of the th string so my hand has much less distance to travel i ve not found anything to support these a type barre chords nor the others d g c i find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance tons of useful information on this wheel my only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written seems like reasonably durable construction compact enough to stow it in a guitar case hi i thought these pots would come without the proper caps it s not on the description of the product and they did so i m pleased by it have not installed them yet they are cts brand it s hard to read what uf are the caps i think they are uf the standard for fender guitars i bought to use for my squire strat it also fit my tele to a real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig this is a fantastic product that is well made the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition the tool is extremely useful i have just started playing with a band and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from i also know what notes are in each chord in addition it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys for example say you re playing the i iv and v chords in the key of c but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb find out the new i iv and v chords and start playing the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair this is a very useful product at a fair price no i am not affiliated with the company at all i m just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool in my opinion this is a five star product these are not the greatest but they re cheap and they get to you fast when you need them i ve only had one fail and i ve bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio amazon is the first place i go when i need cables for audio video computers or concert lighting good music to all they sound great and i d purchase them again with ten packs it will likely be a while before i do so i thought it would be resin or plastic not so it was made heavier and nicer the metal must have will be in the family a while i can tell
532	it is sturdy well made feels hefty in your hands with an extremely smooth action everything the shubb winder is not well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa but what is the point if it is so much inferior i think it proves that it is not about where it is made but how it is designed and manufactured update the very latest vic firth phones have a much improved headband and less bulky earcups while i now prefer the latest direct sound ex s a vast improvement over my original ds cans mentioned below the firth s are still very good and as a bonus cost half as much i still use both brands please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones without background noise for reference one can easily play them too loudly which in turn can lead to hearing loss over time update i now own three pairs of vic firth isolation headphones and i m happy to report the original pair is still going strong meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units carefully adjusted to add little no volume to the signal path unity gain as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a behringer u control uca dac and a small behringer eurorack ub mixer to provide silky smooth state of the art amplification for the vic firth isolation headphones the resulting sound is absolutely top drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price about total i paid for the entire system affordable technology in the service of great art update these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones the newest pair live in my gym bag both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble e g getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat bonus tip because these are full sized headphones with large ear cups i frequently use them in conjunction with the new hearos high fidelity full audio spectrum ear plugs lt the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does i play my mp player or other signal source decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate decibels leaving me with the same music and way less background noise this stuff may not fit your head ears as well as it fits mine but you might try it if you re so inclined original review how does an adhd adult maintain focus in a busy high tech work environment soothing music is part of the fix active noise canceling headphones i ve tried and replaced several but they either sound badly are prone to electrical mechanical problems or both what to do vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers isolation headphones i own and use them both the direct sound phones block a bit more noise the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing both have excellent sound quality enjoy i never use slide to play my guitar this is the first i ever have look like good quality i just have to learn how to play rugged good looking efficient sorta like me have several tuners of different names and quality but this seiko is certainly the quickest the rubber housing is an excellent idea would buy another
533	it s a pop filter in case one wasn t good enough they double it up works great no complaints whatsoever no need for a fancy pansy metal mesh screen this works just as good this pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter it is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile i figured i d buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one one of the cheapest prices on amazon and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has i was also hoping that it played well well i ve been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good and i ve had no technical issues what so ever i would recommend to anyone keep up the good work i own a fender reverb reissue and i had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very very difficult to find however i bought this jj electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until i had enough money to afford a higher end tube and this blew me away i was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it in fact i think i will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it s almost dead before i purchase another tube this mini telescoping boom is the bomb it is built very well with long lasting parts it looks very professional and works without any problems it fit perfect on my new hercules mic stand and was ready to go it holds your condenser mic very solid for a worry free session especially if you have an expensive heavy mic you want to protect without any question of durability i d say it it worth every penny if you prefer quality equipment in your studio this one is definitely a hit
534	i purchased of these of the four was no good on arrival another failed after short time uses i will not buy more the first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these for the should be more dependable i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables this are a great value for your buck the only thing i didn t like about these the cable ties suck haha if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you i own the older color bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though it has a nice color throw too it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but this new led version is built with less quality when you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one about every second they do not stop flashing when it s plugged in since it don t have an on off switch if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldn t be a problem i d prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it don t when you try to adjust the audio flashing it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by plastic pegs sticking through the back they will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around within hour of getting it i had to take it apart push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place i love the light but it s not as useful to me since it s always flashing it s possible i have a defective one not sure the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light update i played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better when you turn it all the down the lights stopped flashing until the music started again the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops i guess i got a bad one
535	i have many planet waves cables they all work well are well constructed and are a good value i would highly recommend any plant waves cables by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic b unfortunately it was the wong switch but it has true fender quality well built heavy duty construction the switches are rock solid this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action rubber no skid bottom is a plus i kept the switch because of the quality i know it will come in handy sooner or later i ve been using d addario xl strings since the s i love em the pack price is amazing you need this to get the most out of your super champ xd amp the only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic no telling how long the switches will last fender tends to make good products price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo i really like the foot switch seems well made for the price and works as advertised i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery better than going to the always overpriced guitar center
536	i ve been playing guitar for over years and decided to take up ukulele as an extra little hobby this one is pretty decent especially at the price point not exactly the pinnacle of quality but good enough to learn on and it comes with a case and a booklet with some basic songs and a chord chart it doesn t seem to drop tuning enough to be too bad of a nuisance but if i haven t picked it up for a few days it does need some tweaking these are by far the best value for effects pedal cables i find the local music stores won t stock them forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about each these cables so far have done the job at a fraction of the price we will see how well they stand up over the long term as they are a cheaper cable but for the price they are great at per pack you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead if that even happens this was an impulse buy after playing the guitar for many years i thought a ukulele would be a fun addition and i was right this one proved that you don t have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument it has a great sound appears to be good quality and well made all for a very reasonable price at first it didn t seem to stay in tune for more than a day i decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months if your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot this is a nice instrument extremely easy to use tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly have used it several times and first battery still has juice i put a set of elixir nanoweb custom light strings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a couple of months ago although i don t play gigs on it i play the guitar just about every day or maybe every other day the custom lights are wonderful great durability nice tone and projection easy on the fingers i bought a set of the elixir extra lights for a laguna size travel guitar i have the reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings thereby putting less stress on the body compared with the light d addario strings that came with the guitar these have a more muffled low e string the a string too doesn t project as much as the standard strings although i ve not tried the extra lights on my full sized acoustic i suspect that there too the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands even with the custom light set where the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light set the bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality the thing that most players of elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability they are smoother feeling than non coated strings and certainly don t degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings the other thing that s important to know though is that the elixirs are excellent at holding a tune once they re stretched and broken in that being said i m not sure that i would put the extra lights on the laguna again because of the bass projection issue a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings don t help as you might have guessed though i m thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the full sized acoustic great ukulele very light which is nice intonation is spot on looks beautiful too a perfect soprano ukulele for a beginner or an experienced player looking for a nicelooking affordable ukulele the latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device i ve yet found the blue microphones yeti usb microphone long known for their line of high end condenser microphones blue is increasingly known for their computer ready usb microphones like the snowflake and the snowball and the yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer ready microphone yet advertised as the first fully thx compliant a standard devised by lucasfilms microphone the yeti is a large tall on its removable stand hefty multi pattern microphone suitable for recording podcasting or any other computer related audio activity it features four switchable patterns omni carodid figure eight and stereo a built in headphone amplifier gain control headpohone volume and a mute button for even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard microphone stand or boom and it sounds great too even better than their well regarded snowball series i ve been using it for recording music practice building tracks with audacity on my windows and linux boxes and with apple s garageband and making calls with skype the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus up to now i ve been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an a d converters a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home the yeti has it all in one package it may not sound quite as good as a multi thousand dollar condenser microphone and vacuum tube preamp but for the money it simply can t be beat this is a vey simple fix to a constant problem with guitar straps and where to connect the strap to your guitar it goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily it is a great idea and worth the cost i hate having to drill a hole in my guitars i m on the fence with this product it does its job so no real complaints there however once applied i feel it may be damaging my frets i havent seen wear or visible damage but as you run it up the neck of the guitar you hear it hit all the frets if you apply pressure to keep it from hitting it then pulls the top cleaning pad off away from the strings causing it not to clean the top much more convenient then using a string cleaning cloth though so i m sticking with this
537	bought these for my squire strat i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips these nobs fit great and look great i would difenantly recomend them i love it it works great no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested it s as easy as you plug it in and or flip a switch for the desired effect and voila it works so duh why do i need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject just buy the product and get on with happy music making thank you on stage first keys are not my best instrument to play just a beginner i m a professional guitarist that said i purchased this for my home recording studio the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys i love the fact that this controller has full size keys works great with my mac book pro and logic pro x i know it s not the best controller but it s good if your on a limited budget this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment i tried purchasing a soft case that had the seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar it didn t it was way too short for my seagull s coastline this is a sturdy case that looks good too
538	this saved med at least instead of getting a traditional pre amp best invention ever also portable downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but i keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff it was cheap it s not put together well so don t plan on taking this thing on the road also on mine the boom arm is very difficult to extend but as it will staying in one location for most of it s service life it ll do i use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over its worked great very happy with it its not a quality mic but it its a good mic for the money some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter first i would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under second as a professional piano player i have never found a use for a traveling bench or stool think about it you ve got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand electric light and music perhaps even a storage case for the cables adapters extra fuses batteries tuners sometimes an extra keyboard or two or a couple of tone generators with midi cables or if you still pack a rhodes spare tines and a pair of wire cutters and you re going to add a bench to your weekly moving equipment caravan in of the locations that i ve worked i m able to locate a plain chair without arms usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players especially are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half remembered melodies to register the physical neurological effects until after the job i ve always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy not to mention prostate in fact if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded rising and lowering black steinway cushions try to replace it with a plain chair without arms especially if you re doing hour gigs sometimes two in the same day you ll notice the difference short and long term bottom line your back needs more pampering than your bottom which is why you need a seat with a back only concert artists like horowitz and rubenstein could get away with those cushy steinway stools minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement some of us aren t that lucky or gifted or smart this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop simply plug it in and find the right drivers my only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic it does seem like it can break easily thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk all in all it works and i am pleased
539	i play guitar i bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago they re very interesting these are soft rubber with a little bit of give so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies similar to using your thumb but not exactly i still pull one of these out every once in awhile in certain applications getting a particular sound for a song say these could be exactly what you re looking for overall these are well made and the ones i bought will probably last me forever but these would never work for me as a main pick i m glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them it is lined and has a pouch for song books great price and great product if you are looking for a soft case this is a great option a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar good material good zippers good design there are much more well padded soft and hard cases available but they take up a lot more room around the house when not in use i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome for travel you would need better but for most uses this is a good choice i ve been using dunlop nylons for almost as long as i ve been playing guitar twenty one years now i find the s are just a bit too thin but for more chord strumming style playing such as playing rhythm the s are perfect they are flexible but not flimsy the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks i estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you ll get with a pristine tip however they re definitely still usable after that one other advantage these picks have is that they never break so i dont see how you can go wrong it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks you can t fit a full sheet of paper or an x paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment i would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarcross straps work well for carrying zipper system works well it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price it fits my jasmine es c dreadnought acoustic electric guitar just fine you really can t beat it for the price for the most part this is a well built durable gig bag i only rated it at stars for the lack of padding if you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you if you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case remember you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that
540	i bought this for my takamine egsf sc acoustic electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well i am very happy with the low price i got and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case it has exceeded my expectations it is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play great case didn t really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about holds my seagal s very well great guitar by the way for the price but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy the padding is done very well this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case the only problem i have is it smells terrible but that s fine i just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable other than that this was a great investment
541	these strings are the bomb i have used d addario s since my earliest playing days over the years i have experimented with several different brands and eventually found myself at home with elixir polyweb lights after having the frets on my guitar a fender grand concert redressed i noticed it had been restrung with exp s which i used eight years ago and loved since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try i am glad i did the tone is great they speak with a natural bright and lively voice that is sweet to the ears exp s make my guitar sound like it should individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth they blend together beautifully when paying chords they have more punch to them than elixir s do and the coating doesn t fray after a year like elixirs either d addario exp s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking i was able to get eight months out of them before i noticed deterioration in tone i think i have found my strings and i don t see myself using anything else for a while this capo isn t quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar if i position it just so it will work as long as i don t bump it or a string will pop out of one side this is quality construction it s definitely a must i m a taller guy and it s important to have proper posture for longer playing periods i m glad i bought this i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for it is made from a very good material and i have been using this for years there are some others capo that are less expensive but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension i like this and i highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level good luck
542	this tremelo pedal works nicely and it s great when you re playing through an amp without tremelo problem solved the price was also very good used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any ernie ball products great very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces i have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use my hartke vx cabinet was designed by an idiot million pounds and no casters not even holes for them who invented this thing he man anyways i bought these casters got out the drill and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp pounded these in and now it rolls sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when i push it like a car missing a wheel but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing of course we practice at the drummer s house and in his basement so i still have to carry it down and up his stairs but that s life great quality casters for the money just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps you can t go wrong with these
543	usually picks are picks but these are a blast i play by holding the horns between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes i had to order extra bags of these because people keep begging for one i use to use a cloth to clean my strings this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool easy to open clamp on the strings run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets i understand that it s only plastic but i wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time i don t know if i see an issue i may update this a year or so down the line until then excellent solution i love my hd got it a while back but have just started to explore it s capabilities sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things the possibilities are endless wonderful i love it am sure you will too enjoy very nice clip on tuner for the price i actually got this as a gift for a friend and they seem to really like it the so called lower priced brother to the enormous line fbv shortboard mkii pedal while cut down still has a lot of the same features same quality build self powered when attached to my line modeling amp a real nice feature one less power supply to hook up foot switches are easy to use built in tuner works great the volume wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp sounds and have them instantly available when you play either at home or on stage i had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things needless to say the strings were at least years old and i was about to replace them with new ones but thought i would give this a try i am amazed at how good the strings feel now they really are like a new set of strings saved me bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves my only reason for knocking off star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be they could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done just use a cloth or paper towel there seems to be a trend in using a ukulele in modern music these days a guitar player for years now i decided to give it a try this was a low risk cost way for me to get my feet wet without committing it takes a little getting used to with such a small instrument little neck and only strings but it sure is a blast to play i wont be making an upgrade any time soon but the sound and build quality is reasonable for the price and for the few songs i use if for it will serve me fine highly recommend nifty little item that does what it s designed to do realistically it s not worth yes save your money i regret this purchase for what i paid for it i m in a situation where i have to sit to play due to hip problems and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat for me a stool is too high and a folding chair too low plus i need something that folds in with my other equipment on it s tallest setting this gives me the exact height i need i m so it might not be high enough for a very tall person it is also sturdy i m very animated when i play and the support feels solid after several gigs of to hours the cushioning is nice and thick as well so these are heavy strings that work well i did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough it sorta cleans strings but not fully i dont even really use it anymore i feel like i wasted my money on this item
544	after returning the pedaltrain jr too small i received the pedaltrain with soft case and it fits the bill perfectly i am using a voodoo lab pedal power plus unit and had some minor issues getting the plug ins to line up with the cutouts on the board itself as the other user here mentions the cutouts on the board are slightly too close together you can center the voodoo in such a way to make sure both plugs are useable but the overall install is not in line i did not run into any connector issues mentioned by the other user review here using the voodoo lab pedal power plus system all connectors that came with the voodoo lab pedal power plus fit perfectly and there are no clearance issues one quick pro tip leave the connector brackets slightly loose when installing your voodoo lab pedal power plus as this will let you make fine adjustments once the voodoo lab pedal power plus is dropped into the back of the pedaltrain once this are lined up to your liking or as close as possible based on the narrow cutouts then you can tighten your brackets screws all the way down and then use a punch to mark your indented drill holes there is a pretty decent video on youtube by pedaltrain which will help with the process my only small complaint is that they don t use a center punch you should always use something to create a starter divot especially when working with soft metals overall this is a great pedalboard i am running boss tr boss od mxr dyna comp mxr phase dunlop crybaby eh cathedral reverb and eh stereo memory man w harzai and there is plenty of breathing room nothing is cramped and there is plenty of space for patch and power cable routing the board i received came supplied with plenty of soft sided velcro there is another review here where the user states they didn t receive enough velcro i cut strips for each of the cross bars and still had about of soft sided velcro left over what can i say that you haven t already read about this amazing pedal if you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal if your looking to play out with it know that it s cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds have a backup take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal that alone can cause problems as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal it has out muscled my other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard i use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and i never turn it off once we start playing i leave it plugged in on the board all the time i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off i carry a backup pedal i love this pedal just don t ever drop it if you are familiar with the pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is if you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with voodoo so those bricks are will always fit keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilled the duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable if you have a power strip it won t fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug that said i have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables this pedal board replaced a bcb boss case because i have a lot of non boss pedals and wanted to start using them for gigs the pt footprint is large enough to accommodate a lot of pedals but not too big for a smaller gig except some of the smallest stages room corners that do require a smaller rig without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case i wrote the company described the problem lizzie wrote back and said she d take care of it you just don t get better service than this company provides combine that with the great product design and i m a happy customer the larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath this is one of its best features truly plug and play yes i spent more than i ever have on a pedal board before portability reliability flexibility if i was ever going to use my best pedals for gigs this was it i have tried skb and furman and they have some nice features if you like a lot of plastic i still like the pt much better for me this is the best guitar tuner it does the job correctly and doesnt go crazy when you re tunnin so geat little to say about this incredible little stomp box no color on your sound build like a tank large display perfect for those smelly and dark bars and joints where all musicians play and it has korg brand printed and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner cheers my issue with the pedaltrain is the accommodation of a power supply i have a voodoo lab pedal power plus the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply however if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested you re in for an unpleasant surprise first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board the fitment to the power supply is there sort of there s no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain are slightly too close together i wasn t worried about this since i doubt i ll ever chain them and only have access to outlet the second issue is the allegedly self tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter once you ve got them in or attempted to do so they re never coming out you ll probably have to break them it s a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board it can only go one place you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don t fit the mounting location on this board you can t plug them in because there s not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own but given that it doesn t fit like it s supposed to i wish i could return this board except i can t because it now has holes drilled in it you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it basically i paid for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro needless to say i m not very pleased comes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple tried several of pedaltrain in the past pt too bulky and pt jr a little to small this one holds my pedals perfectly simple light i love it these are the only straplocks i use and i have them for all of my guitars they are the only ones i trust they are solid secure and they look great and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security love em
545	this pedal does add reverb and it is adjustable to different effects but the range of effects is not great and the difference in them is often not very pronounced it s kind of an empty sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects the reverb machine rv also from behringer and for only more is a far superior machine with more effects and better tone though it has a couple of other minor drawbacks see my review of that item for clarification from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit by and large i ve had great experiences with behringer pedals but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in years of playing no stronger than the reverb in a w first act amplifier i was looking for a portable fold up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around found the guardian at amazon and thought for how could i go wrong oops wrong the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely but i found it next to impossible to get my fender jazz bass to stand up in it the lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn t blow this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don t care too much about but for for an electric guitar or bass no way i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support live and learn what more can you ask for at roughly this is a very useful guitar compressor it is a simple compressor that s it easy to understand with responsive controls i use compressors quite a lot in my pa rack i have a yamaha rack compressor and an alesis rack compressor in my home studio there are compressors in my track daw and in my computer i have the t racks deluxe mastering software with several vst classic analog compressors like the pultec as well as vst optical compressors i only mention these as a way of saying that i am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them i have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratios attack and release points and i have learned to use them sparringly and with care the behringer cs does a good job as a straight guitar compressor it is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp in recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working it s not being used correctly the behringer cs is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc i discuss below yes it is plastic but it s fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years if you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long time if money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around and up keeley mxr digitech etc unless you go over i don t think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle if your signal path aready has hum and static this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because that s what compressors do lower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound if you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch this little behringer cs will do it behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use i bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain you can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference i don t use the dc when i play live but i like it on my guitar when i record using my vox vt amp i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt i ordered this pedal based on the previous reviews but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust i do a have a few behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one i won t be keeping to me it wasn t even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs behringer usually makes good stuff and this reverb is no different but what it does best is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb nothing else i wanted this for singing and i have the danelectro fab echo which gives a short distance echo but i wanted something without the slap back and this does what i want it for but not quite as much depth as i wanted but with the music i do not think anyone can tell if you want a good reverb that is above average with much depth then get the behringer rv not this the power supply i use is danelectro which is great i also have a godlyke that i use yes it s cheap plastic yes the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours yes the battery is difficult to replace however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet i solved the battery problem by using a spot outlet pedal power supply it doesn t sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here and it all sounds great it even has a modulated reverb which is a reverb with a slight flange chorus affecting the reverb signal only not the dry signal which is their version of the holy grail s flerb setting this is about the cost of the holy grail and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use unless of course you are an elephant for all the complaining i hear about this and other pedals with cheap plastic cases i have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit this would be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you want a lot of reverb what the hell was behringer thinking
546	so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me its not a tighten washer and nut situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks these have pegs that insert its so hard for me to trust these i always have hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp i clench my guitar so scared that the little metal balls things will just slip peg fall out and ruin a guitar i havnet had a single problem with this system yet and i never hope that i do but if it happens there will be an update to this good product so far just wouldn t recommend it there is too much crap in the world to be worried about strap locks shouldnt be one of those things wow does this stick or what i installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this power grip mounting tape on the top and bottom of the pedal hof reverb and one afternoon i stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn t budge had i known this before i would have installed all my pedals with this power grip wonder need sticking power this tape will definitely fill the requirement i ve played the guitar for a number of years some of them professionally and during that time i ve owned guitars by fender gibson ovation b c rich yamaha and applause that said admittedly this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap expendable guitar that was reasonably playable that i could take with me when i go camping while my expectations weren t all that high due to guitar s price upon reading other reviews and having experienced takamine s quality i decided to gave this jasmine a try i m glad i did what a nice guitar it turned out to be out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive the neck action was nicely set up the intonation is spot on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely note that i changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos the jasmine s c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price works very well i have to of them each does a little different thing they are great for traveling or late night need to play stuff when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better the sound effects etc are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication this thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top i had a lpb that sucked tone and sounded like crap but i really need a line boost and didn t want to spend a lot for one this little baby at about o clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs i was a bit disappointed in this gadget it just doesn t have the quality sound that i expected from the material written about it i ve had much better luck with a simple interface between my guitar and iphone or ipad that arrangement isn t as compact as this vox product but the sound is much more pleasing
547	works great great little tuner i would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed this unit is well constructed switches and knobs feel sturdy the user guide is informative it has a wide tone range i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear it is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set it doesn t have presets you can loop an effects processor thru it simple to use works well on the squier strat i m not much of a guitarist so this is my first capo and i don t have anything to compare with but the quality is way up there i pick a lot when i play the bass fast rock stuff and these are perfect they bend just the right amount so i don t make any loud plucking sounds while playing they really grip too short of using superglue on your fingers these definitely do what say they do sounds just like an amp in your headphones gain tone and fx switch make for a broad range of sound since you won t be able to use any pedals this is a great little piece of kit if you have some fun money to spend on it star off because while nothing fell out the plugs on both the bass and headphone side are very loose feeling
548	love this thing it sounds awesome and is built like a tank it sound as good as to monitors and the music stand mounting is clever does everything i want in a personal stage monitor probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the lifetime warranty i have owned planet waves cables in the past and twice i have sent them back for replacement no problems whatsoever for the price you are paying about dollar per foot you get good quality cable good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends not the best but not the worst good enough for live stage gigging and probably won t notice much difference if you are recording i haven t noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about with these cables they also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where cable owner etc affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a feel good purchase i would recommend these cables and will buy again i use this often to record my band s gigs now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks works well pretty straight forward a little over priced for what it is but sure beats having to purchase another complete stand just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of pa equipment on a cart aside from the two speaker stands i can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand very simple sturdy canvas construction thick zipper two sturdy handles i don t expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart so i m assuming the stitching is more than sufficient at this bag looks like a great value this is the best usb microphone out for under bucks it s a shame that its been out for a few years now and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording the sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as i have this fairly close to my computer in my office and i can t hear the computer in my recordings i haven t used this microphone with instruments as i am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video and it sounds great the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows i did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone but it worked perfectly after that i just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock mount yeti combo pack as i have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven t used the base that much since arriving at that setup if you are in the market for an excellent usb microphone look no further you can t get anything better than this for under bucks just make sure you get a pop filter for it and yes the blue pop filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn t just check out my review video for the blue pop blue microphones the pop universal pop filter
549	i usually use fender picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while i was playing and it was very irratating so i picked these up i no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand the star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it hands down the best pick i ve used i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one i am using this on my martin string the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand i used to use the tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these i ended up using that pick for something like years playing times wk once i started playing hrs wk at my church i decided that this pick had proven its self so i order a small box i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one fyi i generally don t play hard and i always play acoustic nanoweb custom lights first saw on youtube video how genius a pick that stays in hand makes me wonder how ever played without them small price for big help i say this one is more between a fender medium and heavy but it has the star for grip and that is super hard not to like get some
550	i play string bass both electric and acoustic and love this stuff each bass i have has different strings for various reasons and i use this on every one my wife uses on her string acoustic and electric guitars we keep a can in every case very good and very useful device very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do very very well definitely holds the guitar well a little pricey but probably worth it i m a fan of dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one i restrung my martin ny with these strings and found them to be excellent as a new guitarist the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable i was surprised at how cool both the tin and the picks were they are a real talking point and a must have for muso s who like individual items in their collection thanks again cheers these just happen to be my favorite i always keep mm mm and mm sizes on hand mostly use the s i ve been using them for years and so will probably never change i like the grippiness of them i hate smooth picks picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like
551	if all you want is amp like vibrato and chorus here ya go and it s cheap and cool looking bigger footprint than a boss pedal the hue control gently affects the tone i own over a dozen overdrive pedals i know that is just insane this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads it does a great job tons of tonal options if i were to buy one od pedal it would be this or a barber look this pedal doesnt cost a arm and leg but as far as other vibes and chorus pedals this pedal falls short but i wasnt looking at sending alot so it gets the job done comparisons i have compared side by side the following pedals fulltone mini deja vibe dunlop univibe discontinued stainless steel model dunlop roto vibe voodoo labs micro vibe bbe soul bender as well as comparing to some different beasts in the modulation family an mxr phase mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato and behringer time machine summary just the factsa great pedal and my favorite uni vibe of all doesn t take a lot of space up standard power supply good visibility on control knob settings does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise this is the only pedal in the univibe group i can say that about and it s why it s almost certainly going to be the one i keep might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others still need to play with it a little more overall i love this pedal at under bucks only downsides i see are the led does not flash the speed rate and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to toe tweak with my right foot quality seems ok but time will tell on durability pros smallish form factor although slightly larger than a boss pedal doesn t take much more room than a standard pedal standard power supply v center negative and jack on top back for easy access not in the way for patch cables on sides switchable between chorus univibe and vibrato controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking easy to see best pro is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass mids or lows it just applies the uni vibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone this is the only pedal i tested that i can say that about and most of the others cost times what this one cost led is red visible and not a weird bright laser to my retina the price at about bucks is a great deal quality of construction metal case decent knobs pots and switches no complaints so far cons led does not flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right for toe tweaking i have just had this a day so can t tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound not sure about that and i will update this review as i get time to test further but it sounds great to me overall highly recommended if you want a univibe and don t want to do a lot of comparison shopping i have done it for you some users report quality issues here i guess time will tell on that mine works fine so far and for you could buy and still save money over most other options available notes on other pedals i compared fulltone mini deja vibe highest quality construction as expected at the large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking very useful on a vibe pedal my complaint is that this vibe colors my tone it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass this probably helps the sound stand out in a mix however i d rather that my vibe not provide eq because when i switch it on or off i don t want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back my sound i was able to match exactly an authentic original uni vibe sound with some adjusting it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also i have a love hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it some days i hate it but i like the build quality and the speed control i originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn t strip the treble off my tone until i realized the mids were boosted the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag and at shouldn t be mxr dunlop m new in at about the new m uni vibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like it is second place on my list on pure sound i might even like it slightly better than the jimi and that s saying something it s the perfect form factor shape size with no significant coloration of the tone other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode the m gives the jimi a good run and if you are extremely tight on board space it might be a better choice for you they sound very similar the m has a wider range of adjustment on speed depth than the jimi but i m not sure the extra range is useful mxr jim dunlop mxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty i really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface it is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other mxr s use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as i d have to leave it with the mini switch engaged and the red led burning all the time looking like it is on when i was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch it was also a tight fit this pedal has a level knob which i m usually a fan of but i don t see the need for it on this effect i didn t care for the white main led much and of course the power supply location the led on this does pulse the speed but was annoying due to the white led that s a subjective thing i suppose all said this is a great sounding option with that perfect mxr size so a good choice but still x the cost of the jimi i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value dunlop uni vibe uv cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard to see settings placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best non standard v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick sound was very good but did also color my eq sound by boosting the bass and muffling the mids and highs slightly on the one hand this sound matched a lot of recorded uni vibe sounds i ve heard on the other hand once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix the seller had a day return policy days so i returned it and they lost the sale othewise i would still be thinking about this one i was on the fence about whether it was my winner i was able to match a true uni vibe sample but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me at i d have to love it to keep it voodoo labs micro vibe liked the form factor the simple controls high visibility knobs ability to toe tweak controls standard v power supply and placement of all jacks can get a very lush even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted and mids highs are cut the eq effect just kills the pedal for me its going back not my pick at bbe soul bender my least favorite vibe it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass in a band mix i m pretty sure it would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led it was the first vibe i bought and i only compared to fulltone and dunlop before returning it had some useable sounds but with the intensity above had an annoying womp womp womp of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion with intensity below it was usable kind of but a tone muffler i returned this one early dunlop roto vibe a good choice perhaps the only choice if you must have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment didn t color the tone much and that was a problem on most other uni vibes tested limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me intensity range seemed less than other pedals too large footprint if mounted on board but also offers the ability to take no space on the board by not mounting it i didn t like that when you switch the effect on you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in std power supply a plus led indicators good and flash the speed durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots overpriced to x in my opinion other general modulation effects univibes are effectively a phase effect without the swooshy space age edge on the sound you can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too space age sounding vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni vibe and i d recommend the behringer vibrato at if you like vibrato sounds uni vibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting didn t care for the behringer time machine my gear used for testing fender american deluxe stratocaster mesa mini rectifier amplifier mesa rectifier x cabinet with celestion v s pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies a note on vendor selectioni had a very bad experience with the vendor i bought my mxr dunlop m from and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product i provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page i recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal or anything else you be careful to avoid the amazon marketplace vendor called mixdspnet in san jose ca in addition to charging a restocking fee if you want to return the pedal in original condition with all materials and packaging getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with amazon to get any meaningful response once they did communicate they were very unprofessional further when the product was shipped back signature required as recommended by amazon they were not available or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product it remains unrefunded despite their confirmation that i could return the item for an refund i expect i ll need to work further with amazon in the end to get this resolved a google earth view of their addressed explained it all mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex most amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not at least when it comes to returns also while they sell a few dunlop mxr guitar pedals looking at their site reveals it s not their primary business they seem to sell a bunch of other non musical widgets my recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for to days as most large musical instrument retailers do should you need it they have a few hundred positive transactions so maybe can be ok but i can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction i ve ever had shopping on amazon i put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far no dead cables yet i ve been using them for months or so i ve gotten a number of these joyo and artec pedals now most from earth city sound tx mostly on ebay these days though i recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don t happen to know much about them otherwise i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay i ve had the digitech x series multi delay for many years the fun thing this joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy ufo sci fi ish sounds all one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs guitarists who are fans of yo la tengo and similar groups spacey stuff will dig this box solid hardware side mount ac power goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now they ve updated it s look
552	i compared this side by side with two other reverbs the boss fender reverb the electro harmonix holy grail i found the eh holy grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only knob and one switch the tc pedal did sound nice but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the holy grail i thought the boss pedal sounded pretty bad pros of the pedal several settings and with all the knobs highly adjustable mono or stero inputs outputs standard volt power supply jack used by most pedals i liked the spring reverb and the mod reverb which was lush cons sounded a little sterile compared to eh holy grail but close and still good i thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot to my ears the rest were less distinctive priced at seemed a little high although i know there are other pedals that cost more overall a nice pedal i can t really ding it for the cons above so i still gave it stars i had to compare a couple times to the eh holy grail to make my decision in the end the grail was cheaper simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion decent holds stands and maybe a few extra poles the bag s shape from side view is a rectangle compare to other stand bags that s more of a square zipper seems to be very good quality the bag is not padded at all and the material used is very thin there is however a water resistant coating on the interior of the bag i think i should have spend extra and got the on stage padded stand bag but if you are going for local shows and doesn t need the extra padding for air travel this is the bag to go i use this when myon stage microphone inch gooseneck blackare too long for what i want to do sometimes on rare occasions i have used this to extend the length of the model the mic i mainly use this with is anady dm drum and instrument microphone which is small relatively light and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals when i am using that mic for alto and tenor sax i use anon stage my microphone extension attachment barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand and attach the gooseneck and dm without using a separate mic stand because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile i keep a few of each size around plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars in some situations they can be a savior during set up i will empahsize though that anything larger than the dm or dm which is slightly larger and heavier and this may not hold your mic in place really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality a very nice addition to my collection i highly recommend these bags are large i didn t realize they would hold large tripod stands my other bags were a lot smaller and sometimes the tripods would stick out the top it would have been nice if there was two pockets so two tripods wouldn t touch each other but this still works great for the price this inch canvas bag is great bag for toting around a couple of folded foot light stands and miscellaneousbooms etc i own other gator products and have been very pleased with the quality and performance note that this bag does not have padding and does not have a divider but for the price paid i still think it s an excellent bargain
553	i use it to clean smudges off of my guitars and to keep the fretboards clean after use it works well without scratching the delicate surfaces it is extremely well made and i have thrown it in the washer dryer and it comes out clean and new looking i keep it in my guitar case and use it often the d addario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price these are excellent strings the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar they are inexpensive and sound great for somebody that is a casual home musician coated strings might be a better choice the difference somebody that plays a two or three hours every day will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money it seems like yes they are the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better there isn t a huge difference the direct comparison string is d addario exl d addario exl nickel wound electric guitar strings regular light at roughly a set these are good solid strings at a bargain price the exl bt strings are about a set if i were going through a set of strings every few days the exl s would probably be a better idea but if a set is going to last a week or two the savings overall is pretty small i would use the exl bt s my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot the new d addario coated strings are fine but they end up being about the same price as elixir i ll stick with what i know well my lucille did love these strings they worked out just fine on the packaging i don t like what d addario has done all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes they loop two strings together and i hate that when i m stringing my guitar i like to work with one string at a time and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing but seriously that little paper wouldn t kill anybody i also don t care for the color coded rings on the strings lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors it is a small thing but i don t like it i prefer that the rings all be brass one color yeah i m the only one that sees that problem if i work one string at a time from an individual envelope the color coding is not necessary these are fine strings they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend if you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp drop one of these in the v position the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier easy to do and you ll notice an immediate increase in distortion placed one in a fender blues junior before when the master was down and the pre amp volume was all the way up i could barely get some overdrive afterwards it had plenty night and day difference good sound too not harsh adds harmonics very lush sounding tung sol knows how to do it there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today sure some are said to be the best at this or that but for me the rat is the one that does it all and at a great price to boot this pedal is not new to me i ve had a few of them in the past but the rat is just a great as the older vintage models goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer to a near fuzztone with some warm smooth creamy tones in between remarkable no other distortion pedal can do it as well i ve been playing for decades and have had more than my share of them but the rat delivers no joke it just does it all and well the filter tone is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise that might thow a few folks off but it s a little thing really the filter is the core of it s tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little that s great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit the volume won t go through the roof silent switching no hum no buzz and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit flawless comes to mind here easy to set up strong as a tiger tank and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of or knobs for you to mess with and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past kinda cool if you ask me if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues get yourself a rat if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a boo teek pedal that sits in the rat s shadow buy that high dollar unit and you can at least look good while you play but your tone will still stink its up to you me its a no brainer i go with the rat i got this for dollars when it was on sale i don t like inch speakers for gigging but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a pa the inch speaker is okay for practice and it has a jack for an external cabinet be careful with the load you put on your amp though i have tried a few types of strings on my p epiphone les paul and i find these ernie ball power slinky s to have a lot of power and punch to them as advertised and give me the nice tone i was looking for the power and thick sound is due to these strings being a heavier gauge than the strings that usually come with a guitar it will take a little more finger strength to play these but it is worth getting used to these strings work well with the many different types of rock i play and will work even fine with drop c tuning they have also been as durable as strings get and do not lose their tone for quite some time i prefer these power slinkys over d addario xl s over regular slinky s which i used to like until i tried these and even prefer them over the more expensive full nickel rock n roll slinky s which surprisingly sounded boring when compared to the energy the power slinkys give you i would say the power slinkys give off a sufficiently bright sound but not excessively bright and i would recommend them to anyone thinking about giving them a try
554	i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard folds up easy so i can tuck it away it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys as you lower it the support spreads out wide good quality adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard like my title says this gets the job done and is well built don t waste your money spending on premium brands like monster cable and get this instead i challenge anyone to a blind test who can say they can tell a difference awesome cord hope they make more and the world will be a better place peace and love to you all the plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of very thin plastic and cracked in two within a week of light use i guess i can redo it with electrical tape to make it work but i have many whirlwind cables that have lasted me years i expected more from this manufacturer but i guess the quality is not the same as it used to be i bought this to daisy chain two small kustom powered pa cabinets virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application this cable filled the bill perfectly this fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along it sounds great and i like the headphone and mp player hookups good value
555	i bought this guitar nearly a year ago it was my first guitar i never cared much for the sound it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul yes it s x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat but it sounds x better if you buy a squier i think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar you ll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc or just buy a better guitar to begin with at this price point you probably won t find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar had it for about two weeks and i m about to return it now things that i like d it s a classic fender and i was looking for something of good quality with great price sounds clear and crystal good unplugged this can be subjective but i think this bulletstrat is more comfortable than a les paul simply because it s wider and thinner all the previous four ratings here on amazon and even higher ratings on musician s friend things i don t like much th fret of lower e string is dead and like always i take quality control into my rating account i don t want to bother go to a local shop for a fix never mention that s in addition i couldn t figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound like not a bit i m new to electric but my les paul does change tunes in a much much more obvious way talking about plugged sound it s no where close to unplugged notes are pretty mixed up and not separated clear very loud though i don t know if it s universal i ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches what s worse is they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove i not even sure if i can call it a protective cover because it s pretty weak and thin this is overall an ok guitar consider its price it can be made at least slightly better for beginners on budget with less than i would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price for example me i got a sx deimos les paul which i m in love with now simply everything about it is better and i finally get the feelings of an electric i m glad i don t need to stuck with this anymore according to amazon stars it s ok stars i like it stars i love it stars checked it really is just an okay guitar to me thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars this really cleans your strings it s fast with a couple of swipes and a lint free towel strings are clean it comes with a little towel inside the cap but not very efficient ok if you need it quick somewhere else not worth knocking it down for a little towel so i m sticking with the star update the very latest vic firth phones have a much improved headband and less bulky earcups while i now prefer the latest direct sound ex s a vast improvement over my original ds cans mentioned below the firth s are still very good and as a bonus cost half as much i still use both brands please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones without background noise for reference one can easily play them too loudly which in turn can lead to hearing loss over time update i now own three pairs of vic firth isolation headphones and i m happy to report the original pair is still going strong meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units carefully adjusted to add little no volume to the signal path unity gain as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a behringer u control uca dac and a small behringer eurorack ub mixer to provide silky smooth state of the art amplification for the vic firth isolation headphones the resulting sound is absolutely top drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price about total i paid for the entire system affordable technology in the service of great art update these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones the newest pair live in my gym bag both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble e g getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat bonus tip because these are full sized headphones with large ear cups i frequently use them in conjunction with the new hearos high fidelity full audio spectrum ear plugs lt the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does i play my mp player or other signal source decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate decibels leaving me with the same music and way less background noise this stuff may not fit your head ears as well as it fits mine but you might try it if you re so inclined original review how does an adhd adult maintain focus in a busy high tech work environment soothing music is part of the fix active noise canceling headphones i ve tried and replaced several but they either sound badly are prone to electrical mechanical problems or both what to do vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers isolation headphones i own and use them both the direct sound phones block a bit more noise the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing both have excellent sound quality enjoy this has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar going to also last for a long time cause just a small amount goes a long ways i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar metallic silver sizeand what a difference in sound these strings seriously rock i also use d addario strings on my ukulele and i ve had great luck with those they withstand a lot of play and i don t have to replace them often the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder definitely recommended great for a beginner electric needed new strings but everything else was smooth pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well it feels great looks great and sounds great what more can i say if you re just starting out this guitar is perfect for you once you get better at playing it you can customize it a bit more to your level of skill highly recommended this guitar just got stolen from me frikkin thieves i loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands it is super light unlike my other gretsch guitar so easy to take anywhere it can handle some rough playing its simply awesome specially for what it costs i am sooooo getting another one d ok for the price tuners old style not sealed pup plate mal adjusted and off quite a bit i d suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions on the positive action and intonation good better than expected much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level however i ve purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less that said you ll probably do ok epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier this same chord was almost bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you won t trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today as good as advertized rugged and sturdy live up to expectations and is comfortable i would definitely buy a few more of these
556	at sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic would need a heavier base for use with a boom ordered this and two cables this came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit i recommend i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano i have a pro model with xlr outs to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces works every time balanced signal is so much better no more issues with ground loops or other problems just clear as a bell they were cheap and the build quality is fine yes these strings are amazing i discovered these on my new taylor and now i ve put them on all my gits they really are the better string i was a fan of ernie ball on my electrifieds and d addario on my acoustics but no more i m only using these they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings but it s worth it after buying this product i have concluded that is a lot of money for foam does the job but i think the velcro job would be preferable to this one i paid dollars for this it must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it s not cheap at all folds up for transport works great on hardwood floors padded where it needs to be and has a strap so it doesn t fall forward either angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet look for something where the legs enter the carpet more straight down it s working ok not for hard usei just use it on my pc table for karaoke online with phantom mic it s well done i originally bought several of these cables to use between our dmx light fixtures the day they arrived i happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so i tried one of these the cable is soft and flexible and i could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable i had been using that s a good thing my other cable was very expensive the connectors are not gold plated but it s an inexpensive cable it s not pretending to be anything other than a decent low cost xlr two conductor shielded cable it s working for me i ll be buying more for our studio good quality well made its a simple cable what can be said it was a good deal did the job i used to use elixir nano string and a good as they sound they do not last these do great sounding strings often we get what we pay for after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks i chose solid items for reasonable prices i should ve known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle the quality of the cable this item simply didn t ever work it arrived with a bent pen on one end and even when we attempted to straighten it it didn t connect well onto the mixer board the microphone end was a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic don t buy this item spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand got this because i thought the length would be enough it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length had no problems with this cable though works great
557	i am average build and play a strat i shouldn t have to feel like this thing just barely fits me i wish it had at least one more inch
558	acquired a strat without a trem and ordered this one it fits perfect and even though i m not a huge whammy user it s nice to have for that occasional vibrato bwarrrrngarooroorooroorooroororooro beoooooooooooghreaeaughneneeeneeeneeeneeeneeneeneneneee meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh du du duh duh hendrix bro this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return the only problems is that i m not sure i can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that i made on my guitar investment i might have to sell one of my lexuses lexi what the hell is the plural of lexus absolutely no complaints about these cables we use them to power two fender squier strats and were very happy with the sound quality for our use the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides covers and provide good strain relief for the price there s no worry about solder quality since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable we also use the more expensive metal cover hosa cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp specs mono tip this arm is a direct replacement for the original it is a bit to long for my liking and i may shorten it down in the near future gives a nice little boost on my blues jr however this is not a replacement for an overdrive pedal in my opinion just more of a boost wish it had a grippy bottom made from rubber vs a smooth bottom made from plastic finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem also used these for the tremolo back cover very handy and no digging the the parts bin for screws
559	background i m a gear head with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well before my current set up i played a fender strat run through my effects into a vox ac the vox sounded great but i had two problems the all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig at watts even though it was loud i d often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band and as the tube amp increased so did it s natural gain that would normally be sweet but it would color my effects with a different tone and often times leave me having feedback issues enter the fender frontman r this thing has tons of clean headroom and it seems like it was built for pedals i can crank the amp or keep it quiet and there is no tone changes done to my effects this is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom it makes it easy to dial in your sound every time no matter what volume you play at secondly it s fender reliable with a year warranty no tubes means no tube issues yes it doesn t sound as good as the vox by itself but that s why i have pedals other things worth mentioning it s not as heavy as my vox all tube amp i can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another it s got x inch speakers they push some serious sound and they have some low punch too my vox had a better speaker but the inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes this amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down my vox may be a better recording amp but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year first the reasons why i awarded this five stars the construction is uniformly excellent both ends have strain reliefs the connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which i insert it and the xlr end is a quality component i purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in mypowerwerks watt personal p a systeminto something more useable this greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable pa by allowing me to plug in another mic since i have three of those units daisychained i was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter another reason why i love this is it s noise free in some environments in which i play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit i have not had that problem with this one so it s another plus overall i am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case i damage or lose my primary one it s a bit pricier than others i considered but i feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium i started two years ago with a watt spider iii then along with other amps bought a spider jam i thought they were all great now they come out with spider iv and the difference in the sound is dramatic they are getting very very close to tube sound so much so that for the lousy compared to say for watts of tube this is a real steal loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone the pitch shifter and available manual settings just add to the fun and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard says so right in the manual the only difference i see is with the generation ii pedal you get a usb port does it sound as creamy and smooth as my peavey delta blues or crate palomino tube units no there is still a little digital overlay around in there but most people who are looking for a great home based amp or maybe a church or small gig amp this is a winner and the price is just nuts forget the peavy vyper this is hands down much better and you don t have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the vyper do not expect this to sound like a fender frontman with x speakers but for practicing in your bedroom or similar it s perfect plenty of sound effects to mess around with are they as good as dedicated per stomp box effects probably not but so what just found out the best part of this amp you can connect it via the usb port to your pc not only for using the rather cheesy fender software but it lets you pipe your guitar s sounds into software like garage band you can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an m audio m track or similar ps it is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the mic or line in in of your computer even with the right adapter plugs as the impedances will not be right on top of that i have connected the mac s headphone audio out to the amp s aux in sounds much better than listening to the pc s normal puny speakers update while the built in usb interface does work a dedicated device with good pre amps like the focusrite i is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer update to the update while i am keeping this amp for convenience i have quickly learned that nothing can match a real tube amp you can simulate all you want and i am talking much more expensive sw solutions its like imitation chocolate vs real chocolate got the marshall dsl watt combo amazing sound i have been playing for years have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state currently own and use marshall jcm dsl w b cabmarshall mg half stackfender super champ x w carvin cabfender frontman rline spider iii watt x kustom watt combo x out of my solid state amps this one sounds the best in fact this amp sounds great gets plenty loud is affordable and is not some junk brand you have never heard of has a great clean tone with a lot of low end reverb sounds great as well a little overdrive sounds good too unless you use too much gets quite noisy and loses its clarity remember this amp is not for metal if high gain is what your after then stay away if you are into any other kind of music then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price also unless your playing with a drumset this amp is overkill as far as volume goes watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist if you are into any other kind of music then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price all in all this amp was a good buy and i recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range but this wouldn t be a very good review without having some cons so here are mine these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying power switch is on the back i find it annoying to have to reach around the back of the amp and feel for the power switch every time i turn it on it is especially annoying if you are like me and have limited space and stack your amps on top of each other with another amp sitting on top of my frontman r the power switch is even harder to get to effects loop is on the front the last thing i want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere when using the effects loop one has to deal with looking at two more wires hanging down over the front of your amp when they could be hidden in the back not the end of the world but i just don t understand why why fender why foot switch jack is on the front this one is not so bad but just adds more messy wires to the picture reverb is not foot switchable foot switch includes channel and boost buttons a third button for reverb would have been amazing cab is made of super cheap particle board not that i expected anything different in this price range but the wood used is so soft that you cannot pick it up by the back i could easily break a piece off with my bare hand if i wanted to no exaggeration i know because when i first got this amp i went to pick it up and i immediately stopped myself because i could feel it about to break bottom line buy if this is the best amp you can afford this matches the sound your after you need the watts to be loud enough for a drumset you want the fender name and sound without the huge price tag dont buy if you play metal hard rock this is your first amp you only plan on playing at bedroom levels you can afford a tube amp
560	i use these on my hofner and gibson es they sound amazing and feel fantastic these will be the only strings to go on my jazz guitars from now on i put these on my dlx players strat but it wasn t a piece of cake first problem no instructions came with the package found a method done by another searching online served as a guide second after removing the old fender tuners i noticed the new tuners didn t fit into the slots this meant drilling out the holes by another of an inch blue tape both sides as to prevent marring third the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock there are also with two dimples i used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement then carefully drilled two holes per tuner take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock these rest was simple install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze if you are not mechanically inclined then i strongly suggest you go to a luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions these are a direct drop in replacement on fender standard mim stratocasters fender american standard fender american deluxe i have replaced my tuners of this style with fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish but you can get them ultimately i ordered a set of these non locking ones the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender s schaller s gold hardware not all gold hardware is the same color gold the quality is good and they look and function well however i returned them because they are not locking i ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar i was building if you just want gold tuners don t care about the string locking feature and are playing a fender strat or tele you can t beat these by comparison to a lot of the gold tuners the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too i picked up another one of these for a new guitar and i m very impressed they ve upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one i purchased a few years ago excellent stand
561	i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes the stock tuners have one peg these have two despite this installing them was quite easy they have a high build quality and work great i was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first but now i m glad i did i will start with saying this is not a class tube amp meaning all tube in the pre ampand the amplifier sections i will also say that if you can find one used buy it it is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp ipurchased this amp about years ago and love it the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp it uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid watts of sound the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube i am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web this amp has two channels one clean classic blackface tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in effects and different amplifier voices you can purchase a foot switch for about that enable you switch between channelone and channel two the amp also has a speaker out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker there is also a line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop the amplifier use three tubes x ax and x v s it s speaker is a inch ohm special design fender if you want to get louder fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a eminence rajin cajun you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think some players are comfortable with the stock speaker with regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods this is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that i will say that the clean channel is very nice whether i play through my gibsons or myfender tele i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp it will breakupwhen you dial up to about or on the master the digital voicing processor dsp from what i read from more experienced players arepretty darn close to the original voices like tweed british think vox jangle fenderhot rod metal an acoustic super clean tone optimized for finger picking there is alsoa clean jazz tone that has the character of the fender jazz king amplifier again i amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices with regard to the effects vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic it is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want authentic if you want or need a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp it weighs only pounds kg so it s portability is very good this ampwas a wonderful deal at when i originally bought it in it is still a good dealtoday if you can find one used there are something special about these strings they ring so bright and beautiful i absolutely love them for my fenders i honestly don t use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele they re gorgeous sounding especially when new constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp it is not nearly as heavy as i would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together controlsthe iii comes with a button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly you can expand to add an optional button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets the controls are intuitive and easy to use it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs comparing to other amps the fender gdec does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line vox and peavy have offered in the past all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects but how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them line offers tons of sounds most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what i find with line is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little inch champ tons of character and tone you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model think the jimi blues cd the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing fender bassman wow you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end with some singing highs deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps they are all bold and in your face just play one acdc riff into the s amp and you ll recognize the sound as far as the vintage tones go i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good i was wrong the s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model this is certainly your metallica amp the metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones you can have one guy who sets all presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash it is limitless i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar they all sound very cool on this amp the classic vibe s strat really impresses me through this amp so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound i am really loving it this amp can play really really loud with it s watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes i have kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse the system is super easy to use and store on your amp as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well but you will find some gems too i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later the final wordi am a father of who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones i hate overprocessed guitar tones this amp is perfect for me perfect the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased i have a strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it there is no better modeling amp for my needs i do own a few behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range and this pedal will stay in my collection i ve spent for a few of my pedals but i order and try many other pedals within the same effects range because some i believe are just to costly for what you get and the sound quality usually are not that far apart i would put this pedal in that category this is my st compressor pedal and while i dint think i really needed this type of pedal for the price i thought i would give it a try wow the behringer dc dynamics compressor pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal board plus i get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set so i can go quiet on an apartment at late hours with a watt amp that s nice so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal
562	i am extremely pleased with this amp i purchased it because i was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill the numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud the other reviews detail the exact specs much better than i could so i will defer to them for that however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone i highly recommend it these are great tuners and they look great i ve never had a lot of interest in locking tuners except on my floyd rose guitars finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem also used these for the tremolo back cover very handy and no digging the the parts bin for screws the screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn t have to carry so many parts nope doesn t fit a squire affinity just fyi
563	does what its suppose to only giving it stars because they should have a multiple preset switch available rather then only letting you do one this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill but this is the switch for that amp this little fellow is great the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro everything else plugs right in no hassle with the right jacks and stuff my headphone jack was a different size but i went from to with a reducer i had on hand i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program i ve been recording using garage band works great anytime i can get a product that works as it s suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff it s a star in my book oh there are two ports for speakers on the back side i haven t used yet just trying to decide what speakers to purchase i ve noticed that the two button tremelo vibrato pedals for the fender deluxe reverb re issue and twin reverb re issue break down pretty quick this replacement so far is hanging in there this pedal is amazing it is a very good sounding distortion pedal seems to be very sturdy and the price is absolutely unbeatable for there is no reason not to try it you won t be disappointed if you do mr miyagi couldn t have said it any better robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble plenty of lead so i can position it where i need it and thank heavens for duct tape switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm would have received a star rating had it been in a metal enclosure it is plastic but it suits my needs my only complaint is that it doesn t seem as accurate as some traditional tuners but that s probably by design so you aren t fiddling over fractions of a semitone when you re trying to tune your guitar between songs sets the fender button footswitch is made specifically for the fender mustangs it works exactly how i expected it to switches quickly and on point from effects though its only good for effects duh the right angled plug is annoying after awhile because its right next too where you plug your guitar in and oftens get tangled with my guitar cord making it look messy other then that it gets the job done for when i practice jam out with friends this is the last capo you will ever need to buy unless you have the need for both curved and straight capos for various fretboards in which case you ll still want to stay with the g th capos for both needs no need to worry about damaging your guitar neck from over tightening or nonpadded contact no spring clamp to wear out lose gripping strength which produces a buzz over time low profile design is the easiest for playability as you don t have to learn to play around it like you do on a keyser the unique adjustable tension also allows you to control to sound to your liking great for advanced tricks like capoing just a few strings can t say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple unobtrusive design love it and have one in every case as stated i use the d addario s and s on all my electric guitars except for thegibson lp s and i use brite wires on those i like the d addario s over the brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier i do not produce a lot of body acid so strings last a very long time with me no matterwho the manufacturer is and i play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse the exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp this runs from my guitar to the pedal works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal this is actually my best cable and i think i will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp it s got a great tone much better than the black one i had yrs ago i just downsized from a watt blues deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side i can say they sound very very similar as they have the same speaker but the bj is much lighter that being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo i was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone didn t do that on my last one this pedal works great for that too it feels very solid and it doesn t make any audible clicking noises that i can hear when engaging it
564	if you re a metalhead stay away i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g blows it out of the water this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion it s great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch but if you demand metal get far away should have paid the extra and bought the mustang oh well the amp has light sound and not much control good for my small space though this device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone sounds like a s video game beep but i am just being picky i bought this for my son and he loves it for the money this thing sounds just fine i got it for my son to toy around with he barely ever uses it but the times it s been plugged in it puts out pretty good sound for the price for the price this works really well i see no faults it can unscrew pretty easily but this is hardly a problem right now this cup holder clamps on easily and really holds your drink so you dont have to worry about it the insert part is made out of thick material so it will smash down when you pack it up you dont really notice the name on both sides at gigs just a cold beer in front of you thats always in the same place i love it
565	this is a very nice cable for the price i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic haven t noticed any hum or crackles for sure a good buy great price but unfortunately this product didn t work for me fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i m happy with the results this works in some applications but doesn t work in many others even when detected by the software it will not work with line equipment too bad because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks also with my win x machine i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware sending and receiving midi pc and midi cc as well as transmitting midi clock in and out i simply couldn t get this to work most of the time active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely in contrast i purchased the mu s xmidi x tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it i should have totally returned this product instead it s in a landfill i bought one of these a couple of years ago i used it to connect my behringer bcr in midi mode naturally to my computer for mixing duties in reaper it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints a few weeks ago it stopped working i had bent the usb connector and so i thought that was the culprit so i bought another the replacement arrived and installed with no issues but i m still having trouble getting it to send midi data into the computer midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine i m not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky windows update that s happened lately but it s certainly not ideal in my haste having seen it install ok but without trying to actually use it i discarded the packaging unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit so now it looks like i m stuck with two possibly broken usb midi interfaces i have reinstalled windows tried both with another computer uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers all kinds of good stuff and i still can t get either of them to send midi data into the computer i was v e r y close to throwing my behringer unit away as i thought it was broken too thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok this means i just need to get and buy some midi cables and i ll be back in business so i d say buy one of these and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away when they work they re absolutely great and they re so cheap if you receive a lemon return it and order another it s worth it if you re not in a hurry if you are in a hurry then order a few of them or just get something else i d also like to advise people that reports of midi latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer i strongly suspect that the speed of transferring midi data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think and the actual latency you re experiencing is that of converting your midi data into audio this happens inside your computer and has nothing to do with this device s performance it s purely down to your hardware and software configurations all this talk of asio is only really going to help you on the audio side of things if you re using this device to record midi data then you should have no issues at all as long as you get one that works cheers the cable came in the time it was promised it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows computer my music program had no problem detecting it and using it i was able to connect it to my pc there was a horrible delay between the keyboard and the pc but once i installed better midi software coolsoft virtualmidisynth and turned down the delay it s nearly realtime i had problems getting it to work on my imac it recognized the device s presence but it didn t produce any sound on the computer i don t know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off the respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it it was just a freaking hassle i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook which doesn t have a midi input but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface these picks are great the best part is the pack i always have spares this is a thicker pick i would recomend you actualy try one before you by of them the only complaint comes from my wife since they tend to pop up all over the house not the same as a mxr so don t get your hopes up on that it is however a great compressor for the money and useful for many applications i find myself using it for bass more than guitar but its great for either my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another yep always the gamble have used them for months with no failures decent quality ends and build there s really nothing else to say about them and i m saying it now to reach the minimum length requirement buy some now i purchased a budget passive soundhole pickup for a guitar i bring to a local open mic to get any volume from it the sound guy had to boost the channel very high and the sound was still a bit thin i found the behringer pb and after reviewing various posts about it as well as checking out the youtube demos of the device i purchased it i used it for the past four weeks at the open mic and have been impressed with how it boosts the sound without effort i can add a bit of bass which makes the guitar finally sound as it should too this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now
566	i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well inexpensive light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar folds up and can easily be stored highly recommend this for the guitar player i play a cordoba classical and these strings are the best i ve found for it the bass strings really resound all strings stretch and hold within three days and they last longer than i ve expected for classical strings i ve not yet had a broken string with them i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price i previously had thelucero lc classical guitar black black which i was completely happy with as a beginner when it got damaged beyond repair i looked into thecordoba dolce size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i didn t really like the size so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar while it isn t it the prettiest guitar out there it s by no means ugly even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar the smell of this guitar is also amazing it doesn t have the cheap wood glue smell of other low end guitars but a nice rich smell of wood even after a few months kept in a humicase the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars especially those at a lower price range not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of being a cedar guitar the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package it is a high quality gig bag with lots of padding inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books when i ordered this guitar from amazon the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely overall i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years highly recommended
567	the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand while not as pictured these are good enough for us as we my daughert son and me learn to play guitars the mix of different thicknesses was fairly even so we were able to select the one that felt right for each of us the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks cfh this was a terrific deal my son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic so i decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great i ve been using these picks for eight months and they last forever i lose them before they wear out i ll be buying and recommending these for a long time these picks come in a large range of sizes but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with there is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers but it goes away after a bit they seem to be decent quality the thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly these are ok to have around the house to play with but i would not recommend them for live performance this was a great purchase a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them great price and purchase
568	i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights i also think these strings last a decent amount of time particularly if you wipe your strings after playing which i need to get better at doing bottom line i highly recommend these they are the strings that i use and have been using for several years now very smart handy design that my acoustic guitar doesn t have to be drilled a hole for it s very easy to buckle the guitar strap on the neck its botton button of the guitar that is i may have misunderstood the product description but i prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this my issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when i play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you don t get me wrong there was nothing wrong with the product itself it just wasn t what i thought nothing special here if you don t like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you don t want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise there are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you don t want the logo on the front of the guitar neck headstock you could even flip it inside out and have the soft leather side exposed i subtracted a star because i think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic purchased it to use on a slotted headstock martin and it just didn t fit well for me also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove a string style worked a lot better was a lot easier to attach and remove and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed put a set of these on my rogue grand concert now the guitar stays in tune beautifully worth every penny after years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths i love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time may be due to vibration when packing setting up or maybe it s just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface no matter i won t be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again one advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size especially when connecting stereo devices much narrower than the degree metal shells with screws a couple of concerns i had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length as it turns out they don t contribute to higher noise levels and they are just the right length for all my pedal connections everything is connected using this single length patch love the color coding too especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and b channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light and what to do if one does fail toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature i ll always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board it s a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff love these patch cables the price was most definately the main draw i am very glad that i placed the order these people are pleasant to work with this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings we tried both over the strings it would slide below the nut which isn t good under the strings and it muffled a few so we kind of wove it above some and under others other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems and it puts the name martin on the lowliest box guitar in hindsight i d have probably just got a strap button and mounted it to the base of the neck but if you don t want to do that and hate the lace approach this will do the trick it may even fit better on different guitars ours is a year old norma that actually sound amazing considering its origins guess old wood just sounds better and the price is very right to be able to claim you own a martin lol what can i really say tunes my entire arsenal from cigar box guitar string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna string getting ready to make few uke s and it will tune them also need a all n one tuner buy this or an i phone the korg is the perfecttuner i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent i have a seagull s dreadnought and it fits in this bag like a glove the zippers are also very high quality and this bag will last a long time another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor i had to travel in some very cold weather to a friends home and i fully expected to have to retune my guitar not so it was still in tune and the cold had no effect during transport due to the insulation of this bag i bought this for an accousic guitar then i had to have one for a mandolin and now i also have one for a square neck dobro some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don t leave much room for a leather strap some case manufacturers have the same problem this item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap the dobro had the issue with the strap didn t have a great connector these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch the soundis full and fills the room i m obviously not a techie i couldn t understand how my delightful and so neat little toy wouldn t work until i found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane a ha to be fair i must explain that the battery was already installed in the tiny little amp when it arrived so i didn t look too closely at it but of course when i couldn t get it to work for me i soon discovered the problem this product is the neatest sweetest little delight for the eyes and will astound you with it s capacity to roar out your music when turned up fully and respond immediately to your slightest touch on it s sweet little knobs to sound out your music from there and down to a whisper whenever you require it to the sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell no static at all truly an amazing little gadget attractive so portable and does the job of one twice or more of it s size
569	this is a great deal for two microphone stands they are well constructed and are very flexible can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand several adjustment areas allow the perfect height positioning these should last a long time as long as they re not abused i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence its working great but it does not work in stereo it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive i ve been buying cheap stands and i m never really getting what i want i finally bought this nice and solid i have two behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations small yet clean and versatile great for gigging remote events a great value for the money good picks but not a replacement for jazz that i still prefer over this one nice backup in case you run out i ve bought quite a few guitar stands off of amazon in the past few years and i ve paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones and this is the best one i ve found yet very sturdy well made and fully height adjustable with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up it states that cellulose finishes can be damaged so at least it lets you know that ahead of time most cheap stands don t so that s a good thing as well don t waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand grab this one i m a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices i play guitar mandolin and ukelele and this inexpensive tuner is the best one i ve ever used by a long way i ve paid a lot more for a lot less it has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner i ve ever used it doesn t require a loud volume to hear the tone finally it doesn t seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone if i detune by about th of a turn on my tuning machine an difference i can t hear with my own ear this device detects it immediately all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
570	their are two issues with these strap locks that i have come across the first issue is with thick straps i purchased a nice leather levi s strap which i love but their didn t seem to be enough threads on the lock to fit the strap on i managed to get it to work by thinning the leather of the strap with a vise overall it wasn t a huge issue just a bit annoying the second issue is actually a very concerning to me both of my guitars have begun to randomly unclip themselves from the straps and fallen to the ground not good i think it has something to do with the metal on the locks getting either bent or worn down whatever it is i don t like having my guitars fall to the floor i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy it s the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument they re pretty easy to put on the strap and guitar and they do securely hold the instrument in place mostly i ve had them on one of my guitars for over ten years and on the other for over five i probably won t change to a different set of locks for fear of stripping the holes on my guitars but my next guitar will be getting some dunlop straplocks http www amazon com dunlop design straplok system nickel dp b czvxm ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords straplock which seem a lot better and more sturdy this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as i m concerned it s true bypass brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage accurate small footprint durable powers all your other pedals and is under especially if bought used its virtues are many and varied if you ve been using a cheap crappy tuner like i was you ll notice the difference all the more if you want a hyper accurate tuner for some kind of technical work the pitchblack s tolerances might not be quite what you re looking for but as far as stage tuners go it s got a tighter tolerance than the boss stompbox if you want a buffer in your chain this pedal won t supply it as it is true bypass if you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune this is not the pedal for you the output is muted while the tuner is engaged i prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune so for me this is a non issue plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch these are the only circumstances i can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a pitchblack right this instant edit after some time with this pedal i ve noticed that when used to power other pedals some of them don t like being daisy chained from this pedal s power output most notably tremolos but when the daisy chain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the pitchblack is powered like any other pedal the problem vanishes kind of strange and i figured worth noting here but i don t consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less first things first this is a fuzz pedal and on the heavy side which mean it provides thick ground shaking distortion and sustain this is very different from normal distortion so noise is to be expected whether you are playing or not second a true bypass switch like in the big muff is a mechanical switch as opposed to boss type pedals that have buffers which color your sound even when they are off mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing this pedal has a tone of versatility because not only do you have a lot of options on the pedal itself but it reacts dynamically to the knobs on your guitar since i play a les paul with classics i will often turn the volume down to when using this otherwise the bass can be overwhelming but awesome strat and tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils in addition the wicker and tone features all for more sounds that just the original big muff or you can just turn them off to get the original sound great for black keys they use a big muff weezer think my name is jonas certain greenday songs and basically anything where you need thick and deep fuzz with the option to tone it down if need be
571	the mat is only a few neoprene kind of mat the neck holder thing is inserted in the tube that contain the mat take it out very very carefully i was only careful and the base of the neck holder broke a bit in my opinion this thing if priced or less will be what it really worth on the market p s the wise man say do yourself a favor use a long pillow over your desk to tune up intonate your strat or tele and use this to buy good strings d this simple tool helps protect my guitar from scratches when i m changing strings or just cleaning it up it s a foam cushion with a neck supporter it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage well worth it i think tortex delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color the only way i can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean these are solid stands for holding your guitars i use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great they are an excellent value the reason they are so important to have is that by having your guitars out and available to play you will get more practice they help me pick up my guitars much more often instead of dragging out the case and getting a single minute session i might get or minute sessions a night more on the weekends stands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store i highly recommend these for around the house use delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a fender product well this work well with my uke and there is a review that pretty much sum it up put it on the headstock long wait for overpriced item arrived on time but there was a week wait overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
572	yup it s o k nothing special i don t know if it s the best one out there but it does the job purchased this for my son to use on his guitars he absolutely loves it has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars prompt shipping great price great product after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric lbs and liking them i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric lbs noproblem just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars it s a nice convenience if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions you ve got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly what i don t care for but feel okay with because they work so well is how big they seem to be theydon t get in the way when being used but look almost out of place that is why i chose black for mysecond set helps keep the product s profile down a bit other than that the product works asadvertised note as of june i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture these cables are just what i hoped they would be they work well on my electric and my acoustic happy guy here thanks nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well i polished my gibson les paul with this recently and i d forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was does a great job grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones normally i used the old fender medium or heavy picks but i gotta say these are great stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great
573	i love this company d addario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time ever since i switched to this brand of strings they seem to last longer and make a grab tone i don t know if it s my guitar taylor ce or the strings but i can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed does not need and installation and setup this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house great replacement string for your ukulele great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku these picks have proven their worth when i thrash them on my strings in an epic guitar solo or extreme metal i find myself playing all too often great picks would buy em again bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding
574	they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex this capo is one of the best made i ve seen it fits the neck of my electric guitar perfectly and stays securely at any position very well constructed easy to attach detach a couple of bucks more than dunlop which i have not tried i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case but it works fine and is well made arrived on time enjoy i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money it securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it very stable base the bottom which holds the guitar can be switched over for different size bases of guitars a good price a good buy glad i invested in it by the way i read several reviews which said this had a smell to it mine does not i just wonder what other people have encountered i m not one to use picks much so when i do i prefer a light pick i will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because will last a very long time it is fun to share for those needing a light pick go for these recommended i ve used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments they re fairly inexpensive and i ve never had a problem with them never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear abuse and i ve never had a guitar bass hit the floor a couple of warnings here which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole some people put a matchstick toothpick piece of paper or something inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole s too big or has been stripped out i use a touch of elmer s glue screw in the straplock and let it sit for a day you have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn t work itself off the end use a socket to get the nut really tight new straps seem to be easier to secure i recently bought these for my home studio so far so good keyboards to mixer they are a little flimsy but so far no problems have extras if necessary high end cables also break down they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus for the price and selection and results works for me i ve always used planet waves nails but i wanted to try the dunlop buying me this little package a very good experience durable comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily like all of dunlop products this worked great it s real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance i m a dunlop fan highly recommend to everyone this is a good quality cable and never have any issues whatsoever highly recommend to everyone i purchased this pickholder for my son who has a nasty habit of leaving things in places they don t belong the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find best purchase i have made bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter the guitar fits in this case perfectly and is very well protected nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar very easy not an expert at string picking by any means but they do what i need them to do just fine i reshape my own pics on my grinder and use nothing but heavy picks there are just guitar picks they are what you order i fix mine up by adding stair tread floor stuff so they don t slip out of my hand good basic strap it s not fancy but it doesn t need to be by being just plain black it tends not to detract from the good looks of the five string bass it s used on guitar pics what more can i say nice feel and look never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft they do what they are meant to do no complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them i like the jim dunlop mm pitch black guitar picks best if you want your electric guitar to sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound then get a boss gt guitar multi effects processor and install boss gt patches by james limborg search google for boss gt patches by james limborg small yet sturdy enough to hold a full size guitar nothing to put together just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms a very good price for an excellent product this music stand is og great quality and of a great price i have been very pleased with it i have bought on stage stands in the past before so i was sure that i wouldn t be disaapointed and i was right very sturdy well built good price strings are not just strings guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar and all martin products are second to none it is all preference i prefer the cactus picks these slide around in my finger to much right now to each his own works as advertised eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned a little tight it needs some force to put it into place not sure if there s no standard among guitar makers on the size of the sound hole and planet waves just did their best guess on a universal fit product but on my washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there i have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these planet wave picks are much nicer than the others they are clean cut smooth finish nice texture and looking i reach for these first would and will buy again and recommend they are good quality guitar picks and i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for some guitar picks lots of juice easy settings very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need i haven t jacked it up all the way i don t think the cat would appreciate that i get a little feedback every so often occasionally it s a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar but not enough to submarine this power packed amp how do you get that much noise out of an speaker this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does holding my ipad i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice great product highly recommend these picks were a good deal they are pretty cool looking and i will be able to use them for a long time they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks very nice guitar picks for the very fair price i like them very much of course i am just a beginner this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack it is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but that s an easy adaption if using a copy strat it works perfectly great price from the seller as well if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets this was another filler item for a much larger order i am always losing my guitar picks and this helps me keep track simple idea but a good one thanks this works fine on a standard guitar no issues whatever i see other reviewers having issues not sure if that s from rough handling but for casual use this one is completely fine same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory classic sound i have switched to d addarios to capture that frusciante sound what do you say about a little chip of celluloid well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks these do it for me i like the look and more important i like the feel in my fingers and on the strings they also seem to make a good clean sound i use an ibanez electric and a gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars maybe it s all in my head but these feel good to me using any of my guitars i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday these are the best strings i ve ever had i love them and may bands use them too i bought these guitar picks for my son he really likes them a lot i would definitely buy them again i wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features though it s not perfect it s like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps pros amp models cabinet models effects thousands of available presets tones galore good software for managing tones and creating new ones can be used in front of an amp in case you want to know how a modeled mesa boogie would sound coming out of a real vox lots of connectivity compact enough that i keep the unit the cable and the power supply in my case no tech problems at all built in noise gate and tuner easy to use tap feature cons there s a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models manual is a pdf file hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit though you can rename and re arrange them with the software presets based on famous songs don t always sound right minor background hum uses aaa s in a few hours and the manual says don t use rechargables though it doesn t say why for legal reasons the unit uses generic amp names check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they re based on with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy doesn t sound as nice as a good pedal and a marshall half stack no kidding right and i still don t sound like alvin lee as an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp this thing is cool you won t get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it master some of the amp cab models and how to tweak them for gain reverb delay etc before you dive into the presets and once you ve got the presets you like best use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily the line pocket pod pack includes a patch cord power supply usb cable cd cheap ear buds and mp player cable the pack is new so if you re going to buy the power supply then just get the pack if you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it s like new again this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice so please buy it if you want i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it a day doesn t go by where the stand is not in use i bought these for my music class the teens really liked the colors to choose from and i like the price i have not used mine yet but my brother in law says it looks like i got the same strings on my guitar already i trust him he knows more about guiatars than i do well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning am i impressed u bet cha this thing is simply beautiful it arrived well padded in a double box initially i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws none not a finger print on it anywhere this guitar is extremely well made and put together right it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter the neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities i put a quarter under the th fret and it s right on the money it s considerably heaver than than i thought i would imagine it weighs about lbs i have a strap ordered and on the way the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had your hand floats over the frets i don t think you could get a better piece for the price point not much to say here i have a bad habit of putting picks in my mouth and chewing on them effectively destroying them but with these i don t know what they ve done and put on the surface of these things but it is gross haha it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks looks good great quality for such a low price fits the instrument and old mexican acoustic and feels comfortable they arrived before the promised delivery date these feel very good but they wear off quite quickly so not pick taping and easy with the struming also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical received in just a few days to a beginner like me they like like good strings but what do i know i always have problem finding pick when i need them and this product helps me solve the issue it is easy to use
575	it is all preference i prefer the cactus picks these slide around in my finger to much right now to each his own i m new to the guitar and i m just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best for me with different guitars and different effects i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught the pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the d addario strings they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand the mediums suit me maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying amazon pricing is great the picks feel great and i m having a good time
576	well behringer have to say that the electronics are german mind with all that says go figure it out for yourself other then that plastic so i give stars cuz of the soft plastic case and the trouble of changing batteries but u can use the charger and u will be well off sound is really awesome for the money and it is high standard delay time and sound i don t think u can get the german quality anywhere else for bucks i say buy it it is a great delay pedal and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money can not go wrong good picks but not a replacement for jazz that i still prefer over this one nice backup in case you run out i m really happy with the black ice heavy picks mm which i bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of dunlop jazz iiis i would call the black ice picks medium sized they are roughly the same size and shape as fender picks but a little bigger than the jazz iiis they are stiffer than the s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the iiis and thinner than the iiis too one thing that may account for the nice way the black ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the s which i still like and from the jazz iiis in terms of playability they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness but the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you the tone i love the tone i get with these picks and the best i can do for you is to say that i was looking for a pick that would generate a solid mellow jazz tone with an archtop a tone that reminds me of say barney kessel but without barney s chops of coursse this is what the black ice delivers this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to i like the size smaller than your regular picks and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar
577	if you are prone to losing your guitar picks this is a good set of picks to have around all in your choice of a single color per pack the quality is a bit better than the cheap fishbowl picks at the music store but not as good as my favorite picks dunlop big stubby picks mm they are comfortable to use the planet wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick and i like heavy picks so the heavy option fits my preference i ve got a gig tomorrow night so we ll see how they work then the g th performance capo is by far the nicest capo i have had in years of playing the main obstacle in using in using a capo is it throwing your guitar all out of tune every single time well the g th performance capo is definitely the worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune it is easy to use and holds all strings down completely and easily the g th performance capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose these are great picks and yes they are slippery the reason is the material and method of manufacturing delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions these are probably the brightest sounding picks i have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them i use the mm for s on my solid body electrics mm for my s on semi and hollow bodies and mm on my bass guitar that s right i use a plectrum on my bass you can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like nylon
578	i was an ernie ball guy for a long time but i was getting pissed because the ernies kept corroding so quickly so i tried these and they seem to hold up better there are coated strings that will last longer but i don t like spending so much on strings and of course they sound excellent too stock up like many say they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables how much can you say about a patch cable this is a good one at a good price i recommend it so ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that i noticed consistently so beware of this one channel does v with ma sounds great right i plug in my even tide timefactor and works great by itself once i added other pedals there became a horrible hum like noticable and just horrible then i used my stock timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing ma from output and there was no hum this phenomena also occured when i plugged in my holy grail pedal the classic one that draws ma as well kind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot as i mentioned in my review about guitar polish already forgot what kind i m not really a guitar polish connoisseur but this makes my fingerboards feel real good it got rid of that scratchy feeling when i bent strings dissolved the crud and makes the fretboard look just lovely it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say again because i m rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing this bottle will also last me years is this guraunteed for life or something it should be for the price it is very basic tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up i would not buy another one at the prices they charge but then i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to the carry bag is very nice the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between if you look at the picture there appears to room for pedals but is all you will get i have a boss rx double pedal looper and other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables works as described on the ipad for the price id expect a more durable product its all plastic but no moving parts to concern yourself with so it should hold up fairly well bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc works just fine in fact bought a nd one that stays on my workbench for powering various items being tested or worked on has all the adapters i needed well made sturdy and adequate for use on a pedal board or just to connect various pedals via the traditional way they do the job and are made well i guess the high dollar cables are better but it s hard to tell the difference if you re not using a pedal board these are just what you need good price good quality i use them for the times that a short patch cord is better then tripping over longer cables i use them to patch in additional effects outside of my pedal board and they re perfect for patching my amp head to a slave head but if you re building a pedal board amazon sells solid double male connecters digitech pc hardwire accessory premium gold plated male coupler that work great and really clean up your pedal board ernie balls strings at a great price nothing more to say the cable is great material the s with boots are just right and have a lot of strength for durability price is right for sure the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life this is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural life i e that brightness that new strings have the drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings so are these any good yes they feel great not overly slippery or coated and sound great though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings i m excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player i change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer about gauge these light strings go from to as compared to my old martin s which went from to in summary d addario makes good strings and these are no exception if you re looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted as opposed to aggresive tone with lighter low e then you should check these out this was recommended by a guitar repair shop and i have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand it will polish and lube things like floyd roses do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil wipe them down with a little dr duck s ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case the secret is always use the least you can get away with too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever i ve been using mxr micro chorus for over years they just don t get any better than mxr might be a little old fashioned but you get what you pay for and the sound wellllllllllll just give it a try you ll love it best doc i have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a cable these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others and they work great no loss of tone through these cables if anything i had to do some eq adjusting because after using these i had a far greater signal volume and frequency response when i replaced my other patch cables with these i love them this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts i have one one these from the s back home and when i was looking for a new peddle i found this was still the best around i remember searching for the right peddle back in the s and going through dozens of them before settling on the rat and it s exactly the same simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain i run it through all manner of amps including marshalls vox and even crate both tube and transistor and with a few quick easy adjustments i get exactly what i m looking for no matter the box i m an old school player meaning i want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby trustable quiet good materials durable etc maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalb bcuz of their large plug heads but they do a perfect job with my guitar signal and honestly for me that s what i need good stuff to have i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim it s definitely the best verb it s price range you can dial in some pretty lush tones it has a way toggle that changes it from hall spring and room verbs there d is also an a b switch that is almost a tone mode a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb also has a blend knob which controls wet and dry signal mix and time knob that controls you guessed it reverb time and amount very versatile this pedal is built with great construction though the first one i received was faulty all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on the nd one works flawlessly seems very durable switch and jacks are quality i highly recommend getting a spot or v adapter b c this thing drains batter power fast though all modulation pedals do this pedal does not suck tone and is true bypass though i wish this wasn t as i wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned off for lt shipped i certainly can t complain if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it it does the job as described it though i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me with how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky even for a right angle but they still sound good i bought this tuner over the tc electronic poly tune and i am very happy with my purchase very simple to use great visibility and it does not color the signal when not engaged it also has the ability to daisy chain from it into other pedals but currently i have no such need i highly recommend nice to get these for ur effects they are great product and does exactly what they supposed to connect ur pedals great cable short and useful also quiet i was using a joyo power supply and when i bought my fuzz i ran out of plugs so i bought this it does the job i plan on getting a couple of the juniors next since i only have v pedal and the rest are s i thought it was my jack for a while then i noticed it wouldn t stay in any pedal there is no click assuring that the cable is in place and there s a reason for that it isn t slips right out of every pedal i have not reliable this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after for the price and product quality you can t go wrong with this one and the functionality is great use it as a fuzz distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic jimi hendrix like tones and harmonics worked perfectly for my needs i don t have a ton of pedals and just needed a few patch cables to connect them all when it comes to quality of cables i m really not to picky about it i know there s a bunch of gear snobs that turn their noses at anything they consider inferior in quality which usually from my observation has to do with cheap affordable prices equaling bad quality and higher end merchandise is always super expensive if you need some patch cables for your rig these will do just fine this is a very good strap lock system i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap recommended this is a great pedal i picked up used they can be had cheaply on the used market i actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit the eq pots on the front panel make it very versatile enough to use with a cigar box guitar also the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eq d for saturated distortion the other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular i also other boss distortion pedals like most people i own a ds and an md which are both cheap and effective i own a hm heavy metal which caters more to the traditional metal sound and i actually think this pedal is more versatile imo with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone i also own an older s hm heavy metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that i could never part with overall i like this pedal but it cannot top the older legendary boss pedals its quality for a small price good if you are looking for a budget wires overall it is good to buy although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked the attack knob the control for how much compression you want to apply did absolutely nothing i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one but none the less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board we ve been using remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from classic rock to speed metal great quality very durable you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon this thing is awesome it s so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it oh and it turns itself off after seconds of no sound it does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark but the more i use it the better feel i get for it if you don t have one get one this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe i have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and i love them all if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it built solid feels like it could withstand a good beating which is good since my teen is using it not complaints just works and is reasonably priced i will just say that in my opinion if you are looking for something to take your taylor to a gig in you are better served with an skb in a sense the case should mirror the guitar it will hold however all that being said this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars it is well crafted and cheap i use it for my ibanez exotic acoustic electric a nice guitar but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two anyway i also store some extra picks my strap and a couple cords in the bag along with a fretboard cloth a set of strings a tuner and an allen wrench for the truss rod all in all great value for a good item needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer it is limited in what it can do but it does the job i m rapidly becoming a behringer fan the three points mentioned in another rating inputs should be out the back needs rubber feet and the led are spot on i d also like to see another set of outputs on it as well it could also use being a tad bigger they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together the led for the power on this thing is so bright it s obnoxious it almost blinds you other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise i m a pro cheapo and i hated this thing they re noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummy like drop few more bucks and get something else this is my nd hercules stand great stand for managing multiple guitars does not fair well when stored in non cooled area the handle gets real sticky and causes problems i have a friend who also experienced the same problem so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand these lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them my other review was for the heavier gauge cobalts but these sound just as good regardless of p strat single coil or humbucker great tone sustain and flexibility i am sold on any cobalt gauge head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and i have tried them all needed patch cables for my pedal board they did what i expected them to do not to bulky and the right angle plugs save space great picks buy it this pick rocks for me im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing the issue isn t whether it sounds exactly like a tube screamer the issue for me at least is does it sound good is it musical does it sound like an overdriven amp i say it does it sounds great for blues and rock i ve only had it for a couple weeks and i hope that it continues to work well for a long time i ve heard that these can be fragile but i m pretty gentle with my gear if it breaks i ll post about it
579	nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar very easy this little tuner is very precise it s fast and easy to use i got two of them it works better than the ones with a built in mic that capture other sounds and make it difficult to tune your instrument works for guitar bass violin or any string instrument great for beginners and experts the sound is great and is easy on the fingers i got them recommended by a friend i like purchasing the pack because i have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings you can t beat the price i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way i am not a fussy person about guitar strings they either sound good or they don t to you and you are the one that matters i was very pleased with getting sets at this price delivered to my front door there are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside martin is at the top of the heap these strings sound light and bright very pleased with this purchase this pedal solved my problem with my amp after years of messing about with my mesa boogie realizing the the california sound is not what i truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a marshall or vox this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a marshall or vox one can say all kinds of things about quality but for it made me even more versatile it needs to be in front of a tube amp nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer play practice periods and less finger fatigue i would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic especially good for beginners
580	good grippy picks for some types of playing i go back and forth between these and the jazz iiis when i m in a jazz pick kind of mood i e when i m not using ginormous gypsy jazz picks or fender heavies i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming nice tone as well have tried pretty much every dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing one thing about davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip and i ll pick the string with the rubber hand angle can also play a part in this probably just me i have always hated tuners i would rather use tuning fork on the a string and go from there most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power pedals in addition i couldn t use those on my acoustics snark solves all of these problems the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock there is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo i can easily move it from electric to acoutic and amazon s pricing is so low i am considering getting one for each of my guitars this is one of the few star ratings i ve given any product on amazon and i rate a lot ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo i really like how it is designed where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos i have used it boasts minimal string bending across the frets where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true i capo ed from the st fret up to the th where i would actually never use it and tuning stayed pretty much accurate there is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in just in case you drop the one in your hand overall this is a great product and i give it a high recommendation and five stars have been a user of jazz iii picks lately max grip version dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks pack but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strumming was recommended to these picks by other users so i gave them a shot a few of my notes this pick is very slightly bigger than the jazz iiis i linked above i like this a lot the tip is almost exactly the same size but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger still these picks are significantly smaller than your average size pick the rubber grip area is a joy to hold very comfortable very stable lots of grip if you didn t know dava picks dont come in varying thickness they are instead control picks meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid look at the picture see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick those are reference markers choke up on the pick lowest line near the tip for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming this will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory however even choking up on the pick it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work i was wishing i was still holding the jazz iii these dava jazz come in three colors red delrin material yellow nylon material orange gel different materials produce different sounds feels also in my opinion the gel is a little harder than the other two hope this review helped been using these for longer than a decade and met many people who prefer minimal picks and jazz iii among them this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get
581	i purchased the h n after being unhappy with the h s performance most significant where i couldn t record a good sounding signal that wasn t distorted with the line in jack only to find that the h n has the same problem but not as bad if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h n s inch jacks it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp adjusting the gain doesn t correct it i contacted zoom s tech support about the h and was told that i likely had a defective unit i returned the h and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h n after seeing many positive reviews i really like the h n s design the menus and controls are nicely organized it feels more sturdy than the h the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent most other recorders in this price range don t have xlr inputs since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board if the line in jacks don t work properly and can t accept a normal line level signal without clipping i can t use this for what i bought it for i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past years and have never had any problems i ve worked with pro sound equipment for over years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem if you are using this to record with mics it works great but if you need to record from line level sources the zoom recorders may not be a good choice i exchanged this for the tascam dr and while the tascam doesn t have as many bells and whistles it is a nice recorder and i m very happy with it stars because i ve only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode stamina mode is supposed to run for hours perhaps it does but if so it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode no one records hours straight so i m guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner if not for that i d have rated stars in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent the auto rec level is very smooth and doesn t sound as if has been severely limited and squashed at rehearsals before the whole band kicks in the levels are quite loud but it comes down quickly and smoothly in terms of the other features i cannot comment this thing has so many uses its ridiculous i mostly use it to record live band rehearsals and it s pretty amazing at that i ve also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a usb interface for my daw when my other interface went kaput if you are using this for film music field recording you will be very happy easy to use interface and very well constructed i read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than i do and since most people seemed to like it i figured i d give it a try i was not disappointed at all it gives you great sound for solos i ve tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that it s quite versatile i still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound i want but i think that s just learning about the effects this box provides once you place the pedals on it it s kinda heavy but it won t hurt your back i arranged pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly no brainer built to last and the carrying case it s outstanding cheers overall as with most zoom products this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by it s competition in it s price category except for perhaps the olympus ls which is cheaper but the zoom has a ton more features build quality is good features are good the only unit in it s price range to have combi xlr trs inputs and it records to a high quality however i think zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it the best digital recorder under a grand and making it a great usb digital interface instead of spending money on the track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works o k but is much more easily realized in a simple digital track recorder e g a tascam pocketstudio the manual is a farse in japanese english translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit although it s fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices i gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus but the unit is still a little fiddly to operate in advanced modes my last comment is in regards to the h n as a usb interface i have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface first of all it is only bit and i can only get it to work with mme drivers i have read that there are some asio drivers available for windows but i use xp i may try to use asio all but it is still only bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work there is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a daw software i have only tried it with cakewalk sonar i had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly i can t seeing it being of much use in this regard however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it ps i read some folks having issues with line inputs e g recording a stereo mix from a mixer i personally don t see the problem the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types if it is not working for your situation one can always use a trs hi z unbalanced to xlr low z balanced converter available at radio shack for around bucks
582	hi i thought these pots would come without the proper caps it s not on the description of the product and they did so i m pleased by it have not installed them yet they are cts brand it s hard to read what uf are the caps i think they are uf the standard for fender guitars the boss me is not as nice as the boss gt and will not let you install boss gt patches by james limborg i recommend getting a boss gt and then install boss gt patches by james limborg now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt patches by james limborg search google for boss gt patches by james limborg the very first thing i noticed about the design is how far from the guitar s surface the strap is actually connected what this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar s weight the fulcrum is the surface of the wood if this makes sense and i can t help but wonder if it could eventually eventually over much time and use cause cracks or splits as a result i found someone selling only the dunlop strap buttons which is a great idea for someone with main straps and several guitars and was about to order them when i found planet waves elliptical end pins i think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap unless you re going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders and no additional stress on the guitar s body i ve ordered a set i could not beat the price the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal it is well build and i can use it on other boss and roland gear also it not to big it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board very happy with this item this didn t exactly fit my mxl v g condenser mic so i took out the bottom piece which took a little work then i was able to get the bottom screw plug of my mic to fit it s solid and works well i love this cable they look good and are well made too an incre iacute ble guitar cable i really recomended it i have the ft and this one ft try one as an old school guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous with a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at definitely too large for our practice studio and a bit too heavy to lug around i researched every multi effect unit on the market today decided the me was the best way to go for me mainly for the manual settings when i received the unit it came out of the box ready to go other than installing batteries and worked exactly like i had my rig shrunk down into a rugged small package cosm with the amp simulation pre amp portion i don t need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knob effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion this unit combines everything i need then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking i do not venture into the unit s ability to remember settings because every venue i gig at has different acoustics constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones i want to hear
583	solid construction and well weighted this stand is perfect for desktop use with height adjustments from to and a base per the measurements given on the box the locking die cast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure the color is darker than pictured on amazon black powder coating there s no tipping or imbalance to worry about with this mic stand and it s reasonably priced i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse it didn t ship with any directions for set up which may or may not be the standard packaging do take note that this stand has a us standard top i needed a female to male adapter to get my mic to mount to this stand there are a few on amazon but i found the best deal at another retailer online these are the adapters that i m talking about windtech adapter female standard microphone to male you may not need one if your microphone mount ships with one installed which can be easily screwed out to then expose the space overall i m very pleased with the fit finish and construction of this item and i m sure it will work very well for my uses i recommend it to others looking for a stable sturdy adjustable desktop microphone stand i was surprised when i tested this microphone it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors that was expected though this on stage asfss gb dual screen pop filter performs great and makes me sound professional i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order a well deserved star rating for this affordable product as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock this case however fits my dot custom like a glove the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level this pick will give you a distinct tone because it s made of metal not plastic i m sure it won t wear out any time soon either the size is regular i just wish it had a sharper point but i can still pick fast enough with it to play speed metal this mic is perfect it gets the job done sounds clear has settings on it clamps on your lap top
584	there good mics just got this in this week looks nice and works as intended for bucks can t really go wrong i use this with a behringer c and have had no trouble getting it to fit it s a bit snug but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit i really wanted this to be a great product the screws strip out too easily basically if you put a microphone in it and ever have to use it for a microphone it is going to strip out i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon nope even the pop filter fell off i love the design but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage ex adjusting the position of the mic picking up a mic stand and moving it etc otherwise don t have an adjustable tilt option just make it one solid piece i m tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design it s just not strong enough not that it s a surprise though not much of anything is worth the money these days it s a damn chore to return every friggin purchase these days that they don t really have to care about actually testing products why should they they already have your money i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un boxing and packing things back up besides what are they going to do replace it with another broke a product better yet refund my money for the product i paid minus shipping that doesn t include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place i want a refund plus an hourly wage whatever don t buy one companies that don t test their products don t deserve your business what would make me happy is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question s did you test this product how did you test it what were your results is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence nope great mount for the price filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup quality good especially given fairly low price very nice pop filter i use it on all my condenser mics it works perfect for those hard p s and strong s sounds it s built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals and it looks very professional i wouldn t be on the mic without it now that i know of the big difference it makes having it these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though that s my preference but i would use no other tuner on stage i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars i have dozens of guitars
585	wow for the price u can not beat this pedal i got this pedal to add a second guitar harmony to some of my songs wow it sounds awesome probably the only note here is that when activate it i noticed that kinda lower the volume a little bit i do not mind though and still give it stars as soon as i attached my mic and with my strong hands i over twisted the mic holder on the threads and the thread piece came loose on the stand i think i can fix it with some liquid metal but this is not as impressive as some mic stands i ve had in the past sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work it doesn t i changed my rating from to this puppy is just poor quality for the money you can not beat this the quality is great for the money i mainly use this at home for my project studio but have used it in a professional studios a few times the stands my studio uses are a lot more expensive then this but work just the same the only difference is obvious that this stand my not last for ever with everyday use in a professional enviorment i see this stand lasting me for at least five or six years at home it was cheap it s not put together well so don t plan on taking this thing on the road also on mine the boom arm is very difficult to extend but as it will staying in one location for most of it s service life it ll do i used to use elixir nano string and a good as they sound they do not last these do great sounding strings
586	first of all i use this as more of a band eq using the lower and highest more for lp and hp filters the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders the box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but i tend to set and forget in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that i have been exposed to have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp eq is to enhance your tone not create it a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa your tone is made up of many many variables the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies that is the function of an eq nothing more it can range from dramatic to very subtle very small changes can have large effects small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics i am able to produce i tend to put the eq in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under seconds i ve even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch pros dead on accurate you can easily set your intonation with this little monster works great in extremely loud environments clips on tightly if you don t jump around like an orangutan on stage you could probably have the snark ride your headstock through the whole show you don t have to plug into it extremely responsive enough display detail for you to know when you re getting close to in tune not just indicators like some tuners flat dead on sharp very inexpensive cons a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass i use the th fret harmonics first partial to tune however since it s a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more so this has never really been a problem for me inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case for every instrument you own i ve never had a problem with these patch cables i m running pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out one thing that is important to note is that i m not hard on my gear i m a home noodler so i can t say if these patches can take road stage abuse and lots of setup tear down cycles they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what i ve experienced this cable is a great cable for the price flexible good tone good quality i move around alot on stage and i need cables that will keep up with me and not bind up great product fun little rig needed something to play electric through headphones and this offered me that plus a mini amp when needed the sound quality is surprisingly hot quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any ernie ball products great very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces i have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use i ve uploaded customer supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is when you factor in the price it s plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain but a flexible platform for mounting components one other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table top only rack they work very well on the floor the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank i have a bass amp head and a power amp plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that combined weighs around pounds the rack is not stressed or strained by this weight and could probably hold another pounds safely and reliably another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components eliminating that expense i was expecting to have to orderraxxess rack screws with washers hardware pack of which turned out to be completely unnecessary my only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem if you need portability reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved such as setting up on stages this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment i am so pleased with mine that i intend to purchase another one bringing the total to three
587	i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great it s got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too battery lasts for months well done behringer i prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear less clicky than a standard plastic pick my favorites are snarling dogs brain picks which are very similar to these i guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same i just have more of the brain picks at this point so i use them more but these dunlop nylon picks are excellent they re almost impossible to drop they sound and feel just right to me and they last seemingly forever hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one i am using this on my martin string the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand this is one great looking cable i purchased this cable december and it is still working well and stilllooks good and as fernando lamas says it is better to look good than to feel good well not when itcomes to cables this cable is awg with an ultra pure copper center conductor and copper and conductivepolymer shield you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud helps keep those ugly micro phonics away and you want that big time the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is pf ft this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style they look terrific but i find this fatso muchharder to coil than the thinner spectraflex vintage this company makes the bulkiness of this cabledoesn t seem to lend itself to easy coiling it also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage the easiest of my cables to coil by the way is the lava cable magma which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava pretty doesn t count for much with me i gave this cable stars because of its very good sound is well constructed has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs looks darn marvelous and has about average specs for the money yet difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis if you want a beautiful well made cable that you don t have to put away every day buy this one i ve got a mxr mc cae for my concert line pedals but this one is the one i use for local gigs and home use with fender telecaster and hot rod i m a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars i learned a long time ago that guitar like instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung this is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but i also thought the instrument would double as wall art so when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric acoustic uke from hawaii i immediately went shopping for a wall hanger there are more expensive ones out there but this wooden string swing turned out to be perfect easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall call me a satisfied customer jm tepper this on stage da drum stick holder works great and is super easy to attach looks good feels good don t know what else to write here to meet the review word count so i have these old ev mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled these provided an easy inexpensive solution no complaints straps don t get any better than this super leather very well put together perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets for the gigging pro i think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight excellent just excellent
588	i bought this hoping it would be a no frills looper and that s what i got it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well i can layer even as many as or layers and hear every one without problem i give this five stars but i have two minor quibbles that in my mind don t take away from the rating but might be important to some there is no included power supply if it doesn t take batteries that s fine but give me an adapter this thing was over a hundred dollars don t force me to buy an accessory just to power it up personally i wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added not just removing the last layer or all the layers i d like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer moving to a crescendo and then back off the layers one at a time eventually returning to a single layer i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it i started with one part and then added layer after layer until i had a really big intricate sound it would have been nice to be able to then take it back down to a single part and then quietly end the song this is a wonderful little looper you won t be disappointed neither delighted nor disappointed i have not found it to be intuitive to use and the battery compartment is a joke but otherwise the construction is good i dont use it very much because i havent really figured out what i want to do with it and it is too big to fit in my briefcase full of blues harps so i have the behringer a b switch doing the job there i ended up ordering this cable to connect a q wah into a dyna comp on my pedaltrain board it s the perfect length as the foot cable was just a little bit too short since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard i m not on tour with any group i play for church and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home with other musicians willing to give their time plus an occasional gig for a town celebration or some such activity i ve got a few sound effects pedals and processors i like using but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car this mini pedaltrain easily holds four of my favorite devices it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy etc the case is awesome too heavy duty good stuff the board came with velcro tie wraps power head etc to mount and use your devices i had it up and running in a few minutes and it makes my travel and play experiences easy without looking for a roadie to get help the angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect since i first got it i ve rearranged once already talk about easy you ll be glad to have your sound effects mounted wired and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear tear on wires from just handling i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good i have world tour bags to keep my axes safe nice padding nice features this compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians electric guitar rigs it s very basic two controls and one toggle but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal i like this power supply but i wish that the led s only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to so for that reason i ll give it stars as opposed to the quantity of power outlets and the amperage s that it provides are best in class i have used the line looper in the past line jm looper the line is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier it s a decent looper but it s too big and i don t need all the guitar tones backing tracks etc that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere i wanted a looper that i could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality multiple channels etc and this one fit the bill you can adjust the loop volume switch quickly between tracks turn the background percussion down or off etc i purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracks the only fault that i ve found thus far is that the foot switch cable that digitech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a degree this is weird as all pedals on a board need a degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal to solve this i bought a hosa degree stereo connector it has to be stereo hosa rt angl ster phone f stereo phone m i ve added a photo of the jamman on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thepedaltrain mini with soft casephotos one other great attribute of this pedal is it s built solid and is easy to stomp on you don t have to have perfect aim just good timing there are a few strange nuances though for example you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track this gets the track started before it clears it not good if you were using it in a performance however there are workarounds like just switching tracks overall great deal for the price and if you are looking to improve your lead guitar improv i would certainly recommend a pedal like this one this is an always on pedal for me it s at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe it really allowed me to wake up the board and i like the fact that i can adjust it on the fly if i don t totally agree with my tone that night very nice built like a brick every guitarist and bassist needs one of these whether you run a pedal board or not
589	this is a review for themahalo u pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink for the price shipped it can t be beat free shipping via amazon prime i got it for my yo daughter for christmas and she loves it i taught her the c chord and i play the g chord so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you it s a great little starter musical instrument and a great beater uke that i don t mind getting a bit banged up i was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight well good enough for a cheap uke the strings are some kind of cheap nylon i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound x better almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost the fretboard is painted black so i don t know what kind of wood was used i didn t expect ebony for this price i also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high and now even i can play it without complaining too much it has geared tuners not friction pegs it even comes with a matching polyester gig bag now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter overall a decent play starter uke and worth the for the price this is a steal if you can snag a pack of new strings and it will sound tremendously better all in all with new strings i only spent about on this uke and i think that is more than fair if you can t get new strings the ones that come on it will survive you a little while but stock strings on any instrument are never great also if you don t know how to to tune an instrument don t have a tuner you don t need to buy one if you have a smartphone or ipod touch there are accurate tuning apps for nearly any instrument ukulele included a little back story i used to play instruments when i was younger but stopped in my preteens early teens it s something i ve recently been regretting more than ever so i m fixing that not only am i relearning the instruments i played before but i picked up a new one the ukulele like many others i was inspired by amanda palmer to do so back to the review the sound of the ukulele is great it s not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are after a week or so it has no trouble staying in tune and rarely needs adjustments it s very lightweight which is good but i don t think it would survive a fall it s a fingerprint magnet but that s about the only gripe i have i plan on sticker ing and painting it anyway the gig bag as other as said is basically just a dust jacket i m cool with that because that says to me that the majority of the money i spent on this ukulele really was for the ukulele not the extras for the price this ukulele more than serves its purpose i was worried that i d regret not shelling out another or for a more frequently recommended ukelele but i don t regret it at all it s pretty easy to learn especially if you have the littlest bit of musical knowledge or experience even if you don t it shouldn t take you too long to be playing some songs you have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere this ukelele is perfect for a beginner or for someone who wants a cheap backup or travel option plus it s not costly so if it breaks gets lost stolen you choose to upgrade you haven t lost a whole lot of money this would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument my little brother has been nagging me to get him a ukulele since i got one that s about all i will update if any problems arise in time don t hesitate if you re new don t worry about spending on something else i mean if you can and want to go ahead this will be more than fine edit apparently this thing fluctuates between i was when i got it if it s wait a few days and see if it goes down i mean it s worth the money but if you can save a little and spent that extra on a new pack of strings that would be even better i give it stars and not simply because while i have not played other ukuleles i am certain that there are better that s just how it is the more you spend the better but this is definitely pretty solid over all for what it is and how much it costs i only have a low cost mahala ukulele so i wasn t expecting much of an improvement when i replaced the stock nylon strings after watching several youtube videos showing me how to do it i was wrong these strings sound much better the sound is much brighter and cleaner than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new the aquila strings took about minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods my ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers i would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better this gig bag is well worth the price it replaced the cheesy gig back i received with my soprano ukulele and i have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now it has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends get this gig bag this is the stand you remember from the band room effective and built like a tank you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task one note the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring invest in the optional foot covers if you re concerned i should have researched this a little bit more it was a gift for a child but a child couldn t tune this thing nor could i it was a toy not an instrument my kids are all interested in learning the uke this one really appealed to my son because of the front design plays well and keeps in tune i ordered the hola and the snark sn to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church i ve spent the last week or so tuning a large group of or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to settle in i ve used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent i can t really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one they are both contact tuners meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone the hola is definitely the best choice of the two in that it s more versatile easier to use more durable looking and easier to store the hola lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark it comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need the snark s curved display arm which you can t really see in the photo is slightly more delicate looking in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther i found the hola display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read honestly most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are the really important difference is the tuning mode feature on the hola hola offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its modes of function you can select chromatic guitar bass and ukulele modes by briefly pressing the power button as opposed to a long press for power on off this is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician imagine trying to tune with a an key piano if you don t know anything about the notes on the piano ukulele mode is like using a piano with only notes use chromatic to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments the snark is superior in it s rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction if turning your head at all is a deal breaker get the snark i found the hola s display to be more than sufficient i m currently using the snark on my guitar i guess i did not expect much since it was so cheap just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this i got it for my son and he wasn t impressed does not have good sound but hey if you re just wanting a toy go for it not high quality but has cut dolphin detailing on the tuners just as described works like it should good or begginers as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach in a group if all are acoustic a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers i tried these nothing against them they are good for strumming for lead i needed to use something harder i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick it will still not be too good for the strings but it does the sonic job i need for a nice strum these are fine bought this for my bass playing step son dont know if he uses it but i loved the green i have two a soprano and tenor larger cant play for crap but liked the look
590	i ve owned several multi effect pedals in the past even one digitech up til now they all had one thing in common layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments it was a pain then i saw this one with knobs i did a lot of research and was torn between the rp and the rp i decided to go cheap and got the rp so far that was an ok decision the rp has plenty of features and is a good compromise between menus and knobs i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation to sum up the device quickly the rp is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want but you may need to work at it as with many multi effect pedals there is a selection of factory tone effect profiles to save you the trouble of programming new ones these are mirrored by user defined profiles which are identical to the factory presets the difference is that can be modified by the user or left as is the factory presets are not modifiable so you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory you can also reset the entire device if you want to but if you do you will lose all of your modifications in addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer there are also two additional features which are very useful a pretty basic drum machine and a second looper the looper is really why i bought this pedal it s easy to use and it overdubs i only wish digitech would have made it a or second looper seconds really isn t much fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time no biggie for me ok all that s good so why am i disappointed in this unit pretty simple i m an older guy who has been playing for approximately years i ve played every kind of music there is and i would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets this may be a slight exageration but it seems like of the presets are some sort of obnoxious distortion come on guys not all of your customers are years old i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices now i m faced with working out all of my own presets i m back to programming menus again ugh so that s about it it s a solid piece of equipment with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from in all honesty if i had been aware of this i would have probably not gotten this unit inspite of its good design and quality this is my new favorite tuner not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently it works like a champ i don t mean that it works i mean that it works better than any of my other tuners it is super tight it recognizes pitch differences that my ear can t leaving a better tune than my rp or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like i ve got laying around i plan on buying these for all my guitars these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums they appear to hold up well under constant moving i will be getting more so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it i ve used this in my jam lab for years and use it every time i play electric about hours a week the unit itself has held up well no problems with case or pedals all switches knobs plugs display work fine it doesn t have a on off switch but that s minor it s low profile and is easy to switch by foot i have it going into my mixer which works fine no feedback or buzz from it i like the recording software cubase that came with it i didn t think i d use it much but i do it s fun and easy to record my own songs cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close but i ve learned nothing happens and it s fine i don t use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man which if you don t have you need it the drum presets are fun to use it s a blast to set a drum track loop a rhythm then jam on top of it isn t that what it s all about my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn t some flaw i guess also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak i don t like them at all the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone they rock i use alot of the other ones as well imho this the must have addition to your set up it s not for professional use but when i turn pro i ll get something better i gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day and visually it s hard to read because the lettering is so small also there are many function for one knob to have a little confusion for me the sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice but not something that is best for my needs i am looking into a boss me instead any product that can make an intermediate level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment the rp is an amazing processor loaded with features looper drum machine tuner and dozens of cool pre sets greasr is my favorite you can customize your own sounds but i still haven t gotten tired of digitech s choices the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential i run my ipod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes sweet the control settings can be a little daunting at first but the owner s manual will walk you through the tough stuff bottom line a great toy
591	i use this cable to run from the balanced xlr outs on my digital piano to the balanced trs inputs of my audio interface it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone i use these cables in my home hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors they appear to be very well built and sound just fine i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly highly recommended for the price perfect cable for using with my small behringer channel amp to plug into my mic slot on my small mixer high quality and great sound the coversion cable didnt work t is axlr to ubs cable i have the red blinking light syndrome also but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for send it back so izm thanks hde for wasting my time go sell your snake oil to someone else i wanted to use these cables for my acoustic electric guitar they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though they seem to be built well but i d say in comparison to other cables i ve used for my applicaiton the sound is average these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most if you are a performing musician you would do better to look at higher quality cables for best sound quality and lowest noise
592	this stand after i finally figured out how to attach it so that it didn t interfere with the boom on my mic stand works okay due to its heaviness it does hold a good size amount of music however it is short width wise so you can t really get an open notebook to stay in place at least not with the mic boom there heavy to travel with also so i don t know how much i ll use it this was exactly what i needed for the price range i could afford in a crunch my old mic just wasn t cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles it is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals it is recording my guitar beautifully i ve even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar i ve set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole slightly back and sing into the top at about degrees and back a little i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean i m very happy with this unit price considered but i d have to pay a lot more to improved on it i ll probably get another one i kind of wish i d have bought that combo kit for years i was lugging around a large rack case with my mackie board and a host of rack effects reverb delay compressors etc while using the rack i had a line from my programmable guitar effects pedal boss that went to a rack compressor then out to my little vox amp the internal compressor in my boss me pedal was terrible i was very happy with this set up for about years but about a year ago i stopped using the rack smaller clubs and places with too many stairs since then i went to a smaller pa soundcraft gigarac and some active mackie speakers and started using that terrible compressor in the otherwise decent boss pedal a few months ago i took out my old box of effects pedals and built a small pedal board this worked great but i couldn t locate my old ibanez cs compressor and years ago i know gave away my mxr i needed a compressor pedal for my new pedal board that worked as well as the alesis seems like i found a winner this mxr clone from behringer seems to work as well if not better than the mxr and is much quieter some people have mentioned a slight bump on the upper mids of the compressed signal and i agree that it is there but it s not hiss or added noise and i like the sound my main guitar is a mid s epiphone sheriton and it sounds great through the behringer dc i can t comment of the durability because i haven t had it that long but the case is metal and everything feels solid i don t crank up the compression too much and i leave the pedal on about of the time to control the overall signal from my pedal board my pedals in order ibanez ts ibanez super tube a pedal that was made between the ts and ts a cheap chorus pedal ibanez de delay into a behringer dr reverb for this compressor does just what it s supposed to do it s a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings two knobs one to set the overall compression and one to adjust the output volume great simple pedal clean sound update i have had this pedal now for about years i notice one reviewer said that the bass sound dropped out on his guitar signal with this pedal i have to admit that this is true it s not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable this pedal is not something that i would use too heavily it does a nice job compressing peaks and overall range and gives you a nice smooth sound if you are looking for a guitar pedal to sustain the sound you may want to look at other pedals this is just a basic compressor not a true sustainer and at high levels it will probably make you sound very thin as the compression ratio gets above or higher on the other hand most stomp pedal compressors under will do pretty much the same thing my alesis rack compressor will knock the punch out of a signal at high levels also the sound is clean but it s best used for a little compression not the huge amounts needed to call it a sustainer try the behringer cs for more sustain use this alot on all kinds of electronics it gets crackling knobs going again i ve use it for years recommend review updated after more time spent with the mic well there s definitely some detail missing in the mids but it has a generally pleasing very fat aka muddy tone makes a fair snare drum mic needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application i don t think i d use it to track the vocals on anything but it works you d be better off with a similarly priced small diaphragm condenser and a windscreen i mounted this on top of my on stage tripod mic stand to hold my small format mixer during gigs works great
593	i ordered this tuner so i could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag it s worked fine i ve used it to tune a ukelele a bass and a guitar and it works fine on all counts i have no complaints about it this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too only drawback there is no volume control on the instrument itself the amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal but it s all about the instrument and i give that a the e bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar great tool i ordered the hola and the snark sn to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church i ve spent the last week or so tuning a large group of or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to settle in i ve used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent i can t really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one they are both contact tuners meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone the hola is definitely the best choice of the two in that it s more versatile easier to use more durable looking and easier to store the hola lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark it comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need the snark s curved display arm which you can t really see in the photo is slightly more delicate looking in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther i found the hola display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read honestly most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are the really important difference is the tuning mode feature on the hola hola offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its modes of function you can select chromatic guitar bass and ukulele modes by briefly pressing the power button as opposed to a long press for power on off this is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician imagine trying to tune with a an key piano if you don t know anything about the notes on the piano ukulele mode is like using a piano with only notes use chromatic to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments the snark is superior in it s rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction if turning your head at all is a deal breaker get the snark i found the hola s display to be more than sufficient i m currently using the snark on my guitar these strings sound great i love the sustained bright tone they work well with my cedar top guitar easy on the fingers too good cable as good as any expensive brand thick a bit stiff and seems to be shielded no complaints at all this bag was nicer than i expected for the price considering that many soprano ukuleles are in the t range a lot of people won t want to buy a hard case for three times the price of this gig bag or for more money than their instrument cost the case is better padded than i might have expected for the price since soprano ukuleles are small and lightweight instruments it s not clear to me why a hard case would be as important to most people as it might be to somebody evaluating guitar cases or cases for other larger instruments if you have a small child who is likely to sit on the instrument or drop it down the stairs constantly you might want to consider something better but this should provide adequate protection in general even from minor falls for a soft bag this offers all i would ever need
594	pretty basic capo goes on and comes off easily fits quickly and tightly i expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway good price i ve used both the es and es for several years now they are a fantastic mic great quality and construction i love how hefty they are i ve got of these and plan to buy more when needed i would probably suggest a higher end if you were studio recording but i set up for live sound in and outdoors and these work great i have several brands some more expensive but i always come back to gls i love these cables i ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs they are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day i really think it doesn t matter which snark you buy they are all set up to measure tuning within any instrument s range it was cheap and affordable one of the issues i ve had with snarks is that if you get the one with the vibe and the mic the mic quits working and you really only need the vibe anyway so why pay more i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment they are well made reliable and cost effective the xlr connectors are secure and i couldn t purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light it fits nice an tight on mic stand you can get around ten picks in it so it s a good product very good stand especially for the price it is not incredibly stable but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy this mic is excellent it s pretty much a straight up clone of an sm and for the money there are no mic s even close to this one also the price at orange county speaker s website is and in store so i m not entirely sure why it s on amazon this is my first mixer i d been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from usb powered mics like the blue snowball to something a little more professional and of course that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups thus i am an amateur and you ll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional anyway my pros and conspros this thing is way smaller than i expected i can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn t take up a lot of desk space it fits well where i put it it works as intended i use this with a gls es mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good i have my windows volume set at and the gain is up at about i have no hissing and no problems i did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co host we do it over skype said i sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball it s plug and play i plugged it in it installed the drivers and it automatically set itself as the default microphone easy peasy i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately the dials and everything was easy to understand cons you can t plug this into a usb hub or even an ac powered usb hub otherwise you ll get a hiss this needs to be plugged directly into a computer this high jacks your audio defaults in windows to fix it open your control panel open the sound and set your playback device to your speakers to fix the problem your sound will come out through your speakers as intended since i use this as my main mic i left it as default in the sound settings overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs i know there are better options but they are also more expensive and i m on a budget it s a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money if you re like me and a single person doing youtube video voice overs or podcasts this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person worth every penny as long as it lasts i ll update when if it breaks down but until then i do not regret this purchase these cables seem to be better quality than nady or some other cheap brands i ve seen they work great for me i ll wait and see how they hold up in the log run fingers crossed i haven t had any problems with them at all so far i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments loved this mic when i hooked it up it sounds great and for the price you can t go wrong wish that it had a on off switch but you can get around that great for instruments and vocals as well was delivered on time as well amazon is the best and have the best vendor throw this bad boy in anything and it will make a world of difference particularly if the tube being replaced was a cheap tube wow i will never buy another sm again i can t believe i m writing this but it s ture i am so psyched that i found this microphone it s perfect but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me in fact and it might just be in my head but i now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp but everyone else has talked about sound so i want to talk about build quality it s solid has some weight to it and the plastic at the top feels exactly right so far it hasn t come loose in the way that sm s do if i handed this and a sm to my grandma who doesn t know any better she d probably guess that the es was a bit higher end i continually look at it and can t believe i only paid for it get one nah get a bunch sell your sm s for and turn them into two of these magic does what it should and yamaha quality the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal i am using on a yamaha board this makes changing strings of breeze i was using a hand winder for many years unit takes four aa batteries but is very powerful also has a lock on it so it won t accidentally be put into a drawer and engaged looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered
595	well made proven over decades switched from ns capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement requires less adjustment square pad allows placement right next to the fret easy to adjust with a bit of practice i enjoy using quality machined parts so this is a pleasure plus it is built to last it tunes without any problems and i love using the word snark i thought the creaters could have implemented the clip feature i have seen on other tuners which tunes through vibrations but it still works great i use mediums but bought these for my nephews takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar always love these strings this kid has not changed his strings in years so i thought i would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible it fits well on my les paul and strat does not fly off the head when playing it s very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting the light works really well and that was what i was looking for as far as accuracy it s right on in either setting
596	the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners i have found i have both the the sn and sn for my guitar and mandolin respectively when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on if not sure which get the sn red one it generally will work for all instruments it s a working violin my daughter likes it her violin teacher suggests to up grade the strings and a new artino magic pad the shoulder rest is way too high for my daughter but i don t count that as a defect i mean if you just want something to learn the violin on then this is pretty good stays in tune and is reinforced in all the weak spots because cracks will form i bought this just to see if i might enjoy learning or if my shoulders i m gettin old lol would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice i wouldn t say it s agreat instrument but way more than i expected for after i changed the strings i used the extra set that came with it it actually produced decent sound i bought anew bow for so and found i like the one that came with it at least as much the case is excellent i ll prob use it with my upgrade so for the price you really get far more than you pay for p s the shoulder rest is kinda useless though this violin is amazing considering it s price i got it for my girlfriend expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn t she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked i am a satisfied costumer for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it this one s for you basic but sturdy gets the job done sounds decent and stays in tune for the price this is just what you need if you want to dabble in on the violin
597	run this into my laptop from a behringer fx mixer windows didnt need to install any drivers it was plug n play reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record i will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting i found that others had the same issue i had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer click recording devices select my uca not internal microphone from the list click properties at the bottom of the sound window select the levels tab and reduce the level to around or to have an equal volume from themixer into windows and reaper until i did that every signal into reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothing i tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problem so far the behringer uca is working great and signal is clean this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget you can use it to record your old tapes or records and it will go straight through the interface to your computer via usb there is pretty much little to no latency and it isn t noticeable i plan on buying a tascam interface soon for around and that should make things better for me i will still use this to record anything on tv or like i said old tapes the software bundle is pretty much free as you can find everything on the internet they just bundled it together for you which is nice i only bought with the idea that a full version of behringer s sequence program came with it needless to says its a compact version and for you other imac os x users out there aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on vst s au s that will work with osx and cubase or garageband other than that its another interface i guess as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that with who the uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pc windows owner i would get it its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to daw dat interface mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macs imacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably pros price point does the job in the descriptioncons shielding of usb cable is abysmal very susceptible to interference could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it cheap plastic construction these microphones are great for recording vocals they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds they do not have any detectable noise or issues depending on your situation you may need to have a external pop filter or windscreen however these microphones contain an internal windscreen i ll be brief and to the point here works as an audio interface for a line level signal i used this with my samson mixer is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough the red color looks nice has a headphone out with volume control plug and play no extra drivers needed i use asio anyways cheap there s no audio interface this affordable latency fairly low not bad plastic body rca connectors not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono inch khz and bit sampling should have been bit and maybe khz even my digitech rp has a built in bit audio interface i previously had the uca and it worked great for me for a couple of years but i noticed the audio went dead in one of the rca phono input jacks i had used those jacks previously with no issues regardless i liked the uca so much that i got the uca to replace it without hesitation plus as a bonus it s purdier plugged it in just now fired up the pc the new uca started working immediately no muss no fuss for the money i don t think you can find a better deal for enhancing your pc s audio versatility i don t know if i ll even bother with the included software as i use a great program called mixcraft btw check that out if you re looking for pc recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other costlier guys anyway two thumbs way up for the uca this liitle box works great for my needs i am using three guitars on stage when possible room permitting and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp this way i can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such it also solves a second problem since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs fender single coils ibanez acoustic with fishman piezo and les paul gibson humbuckers i now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match this is perfect for that inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that i velcro to my small pedal board i m glad someone else mentioned the a c plug on theirs being european standard and not volt us standard don t be surprised if it happens to you i bought one and had the same experience i got mine from musicians friend they offered to have me return it but i chose to keep it since i had a volt power supply available from an older unit i long since stopped using no stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn t check their inventory to make sure it was us standard man ya ll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it s all good and stuff man because like when you be spittin some sik leerix and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me ay yo let s go
598	this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag i used these on my ukuleles and they worked well enough that i bought tow more pairs they hold a regular strap well and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a uke leash google it those are fabulous cheers i ve been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of good news these aquila strings are on most new ukuleles bad news these aquila strings are not standard on some others i was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than half hour you can get a tutorial to do anything on youtube they will stretch and de tune for a few days but once tuned they sound and just perform great good price great product order extra to keep on hand great strap button very solid aluminum and is easy to get that leather strap hole slips in very easy very pro it s kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already but i can t help it i like this guitar quite simply this is a really nice guitar is it nice no but for less than nice doesn t even describe it my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing the outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problem since i d read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly nope no flaws noticeable to me kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without it other reviews had complained about a too low action but mine seems dead on of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule but even so there s really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low some mentioned rusty strings not on mine the strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well and of course the guitar sounds good again maybe not good but at least good and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price so if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar you ve found it stop wasting time just click the buy it button had a guitar for years always tune it but never time to practice it tells you what note is actually being played when your string is out of tune so you can zero in on the correct one better easy to install these buttons on the guitar well made and just what i was looking for thank you very much
599	this is my second way switch and it won t be the last the four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series which gives a fatter tone than position and more output than positions or i am very pleased with the new sound of my tele the wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun don t forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder these strings are good nice tone last a decent amount of time and they re cheap color coded ball ends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention i use these on all my electric guitars now where before i used dean markley mostly les paul scale i moved to these when i got a strat scale guitar i don t remember why i picked these other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere where dean markley can be hit or miss they work and are fender parts even thoigh they work on many brands use them on all makes and no complaints todate it s odd to review such a simple thing as screws what can i say they re shiny and screwed well into the holes i have a telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body i had to trim them down i probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are oem and fit perfectly recommended i ve been hooked on d addarios for quite a while the per unit price on these is great and i never worry about breaking one of these
600	this processor is okay for home practice if you need something other than just a dry signal the sound is a little too electronic for me i bought an rp and it sounds much better this little unit is packed with great effects for i m very impressed has just about everything you need in a entry level pedal except for a pedal control it arrived on time i have an epiphone hummingbird acoustic guitar so i needed a pickup for do some recording it works well but it s not very loud this thing should sound louder next time i ll buy a duncan pickup works well and has good sound i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds the interface could be easier to use but for this price point one can t really complain i had a friend with one of these and he loves it i got one on his recommendation and when i put the batteries in it it started smoking it did work for awhile i pulled the batteries out and tried to ac adapter and it smoked again this time it did not work i am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work holds a grudge i would not advise anybody to get this this particular brand i ve seen around and haven t heard to much about them but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they send another one in exchange that didn t work out so well with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one i d have to rate this one at the bottom
601	at sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic would need a heavier base for use with a boom great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar it does what it is designed for can t ask for more i have used these and i noticed this capo is a cut above the rest it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away i do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts can t get your banjo to sound right without a great set of finger and thumb picks have been using these for years now this is a quality stand i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great nothing but praise for this item well conceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks it is small and can be affixed self adhering to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play inexpensive solution and quite handy this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand it s easy to use on stage it can be used with only one hand and it has a low profile that doesn t take up a lot of space when folded and it doesn t stick out as an eyesore on stage i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it it s a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it don t fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friends well constructed awesome price solid good stand it is decent quality and doesn t have any places that will break easily can take anywhere you want
602	these are perfect but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed i would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package i have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don t match they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced i ve been stringing my guitars with d addario for several years while my jazz box is set up with heavy strings my les paul goes lighter horses for courses you might say i ve been using d addario xl strings on this guitar for a while although it s the exl slightly larger bottoms but why not give these lighter strings a try the quality is obviously high tone is good as is durability if you do much complex chording you re going to miss the heavier string but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice i ll be going back to the exl s since i prefer the more positive feel of the larger string but fat or skinny d addario makes some of the best strings out there great product for the price i am using it with win bit sonar xl producer i just held down the set marker record button while plugging the usb cable i then let windows plug play the drivers no disk needed next i set sonar xl midi control surface device as mackie selected the nanokontrol as the control midi in and out now i have channels of automation stop back record play etc i am very happy with this product so far i have to give it stars on the price to performance ratio read the instructions i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl buttons and sliders and great for the price cheers
603	this may be watts but it can fill a big room with its sound not too heavy and very handy for traveling this can t be used for concert or gigs but for use in private family use or maybe inside a church built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with nd day these have been ordered for a couple of weeks you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day hope they work when they do finally arrive good luck i love this system every time i change strings now i go through every step of this system and what a difference it has made the fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great i never realized how dry the wood was the string cleaner is nice too i feel like i was neglecting my guitars until i got this the quantities of product in this kit are good and the instructions are clear the two polishing cloths are adequate size and washable i put this on my mandolin this does not work as well as some others i have tried but the other one i was using broke very easily so i looked for a different more sturdy design this works ok not the greatest but ok this little amp kicks major ass dood i think i may have blown the speaker or it s just how it sounds but it s great for a lo fi kind of fuzz e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up the clean tone is really nice too a little to bright for my taste but for a mini clip amp it s not too bad i can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away theres a headphon jack a v power supply and that s in for plug ins no line in so you can t plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well if you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great this capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck for example a les paul or most acoustics for thinner necks like a strat or tele it works ok but has to be positioned just right to prevent string buzz it s not the ole clip it and go capo i m used to i bought this to have a capo i could just leave clipped on my acoustic s head for use when needed no dice neck too thick it s a washburn dreadnaught we re not talking some funky string jazz guitar bottom line it s cheap as dirt and you can make it work if you don t mind having to place it just right my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one that s easy it does the job the only problem is that it sticks out a little to far down underneath the guitar neck thus impeding the fingers from taking the right position for some of the chords you slide it up and away you might loose pressure on strings and your guitar will make funny noises especially if you use hard strings for the money it does the job ok it s a good one for beginers like myself the stand works great it supports my casio ctk on the shortest level and can go pretty high as well this thing folds up so it is easy for storing it is a bit heavy but that allows it to support almost any keyboard this is by far the most stable keyboard stand out there and a great price too what can i say i love this thing i bought three more after trying the first one i put one in each of my guitar bags can t live without it the tuning is excellent and so easy if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open i m hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar i cannot do it with one hand other picks usually let me down when i riff and melt faces playing the blues jazz or gospel etc fender heavies are made to make the notes sound like l they have been hit for real i prefer no cheap imitations only fender heavies that s what i smoke there seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case one reviewer says it s made by fender i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on show me proof someone else seems to think it s made by epiphone sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesn t make cases they accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost i have several epiphone dots and a gibson es i bought epiphone cases for all of them i found the gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case i couldn t see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case although the cases have the epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by tkl how do i know that you re wondering they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment that s been a few years ago the cases you get now could be made by a different company the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet epiphone s manufacturing standards so it s got to be good this case will fit the dot casino sheraton and the gibson es anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the epiphone joe pass emperor ii has a much thicker body than the dot this case was not intended for the emperor ii it s a great case and will protect your guitar but it s not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway both guitars fit perfectly but these seemed to work well on the guitar i was re stringing my son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more recommend make sure you order the right size i don t use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but i only use it for walking around the house strumming when i am playing my secondary guitars it s fine for the price my frist guitar strap i like it alot dose not cut in your shoulder or back will get aother one for nd guitar this stand is very nice it is black and it does its job very well it also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand it is like an added bonus i ve used the mm and mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career i rock hard acoustic electric and bass i ve tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily dunlop s nylon picks don t break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs you ll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming maybe times in my entire career buy these picks polyweb strings have a heavier coating so i prefer nanoweb for the ultra thin coat and brighter sound they re easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound because they re coated and have anti rust they last up to months longer than regular strings and don t make much finger sounds favorite strings good for any guitar even if it is plastic it feel really strong on your guitar neck it is a really good buy some say this capo work bad i have to ask are your guitar is good enough to use this capo or are you know how to use capo i m more than years of playing guitar this capo is worth the price good quality and work great for not extream user are you nuts best recomended quality and price ps may not for very big guitar neck enjoy i saw this tuner in the local music store for and decided to order it here for within minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on i have never heard my guitar sound so good i am super impressed with this little thing if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get it is an excellent backup capo i don t feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings this same chord was almost bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you won t trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today
604	very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight cannot go wrong with this one a very good strap this item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars i tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in position the short extension in the picture is not on the unit i received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered i would purchase this unit again and again it is a good piece and a good deal strong metal construed legs open to set up easy easy to set mic slides in or out up or down peaces stay tight i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar solid yes adjusts to right height yesit is perfect well worth every penny i was looking for something more solid than the usual fold up stand and this is it i can put a heavy notebook full of music on it and a lamp and a tray and more stuff and it is rock solid very happy i bought this one after using the sn for months the tuner works like a champ i can t really tell the difference between the sn and the sn they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat nice wide lip sturdy appears to be well made and durable nice finish on it hopefully will last a long time assembled the stand in seconds it is very stable and solidly constructed should last a life time very very good value
605	it is not the size for mini guitar may be for the big one connections are shaky you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low i bought this to go with my epiphone ukulele for both myself and my grandson it s a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp for the price it s good the perfect wall mount for a ukulele my daughter loves it instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice installs in minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs i was using my iphone and line input but having to plug in can be a drag when you re no where near your gear but hands down this is the most accurate easy to use and most portable tuner ever i use it for all mu guitars bass mandolin banjo etc i bought two more you will love this tuner ernie ball is really on to something with the slinky series offering a nice range of weights i swear by the slinky after being conned into a a set of mexican made martins it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back the corona california on the back ads a nice touch when you compare it to the other fender f neck plate these strings are great for a string i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel a string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar and i think they will last longer which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring i notice mixed reviews here i suppose when an item sells for instead of there may be a potential for quality control issues but hey buy of them and if even one turns out to be bad you re still way ahead on the deal seems to me as good as any connector i ve ever bought
606	i have now purchased of these guitar straps for my main guitars i absolutely love them great quality very strong and great variation of length on them they are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders i highly recommend this strap as a musician i m in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner i got the package of two unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death a new battery didn t resurrect it i couldn t find the other one because they re small and black i finally did find it and have used it several weeks on my guild acoustic and it works nicely so far in fact it works really nice if you are concerned about stage appearance this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig a plus because it s pretty small but big enough to read at the cheap price it wasn t worth my time to try returning the first one i just decided to eat the loss i m crossing my fingers hoping this one will last if you are playing a really nice collectible guitar be cautious because these tuners and capos too can damage the finish permanently i use a tuner on my gibson johnny smith while i play but always take it off when i m done playing what a nice strap it s a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnought the whole strap is leather no adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument it took me a little while to get used to this method but now i don t even think of it the main strap has several slots cut into it and there s another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place it s simple and very secure it makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain but how often do you adjust your strap length once you ve gotten it set i almost never do it s an affordable strap that looks elegant is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar has great length adjustment range and rolls up to fit in the case i had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitar i have a pickup system installed and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly i would buy it again these microphones are great for recording vocals they pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds they do not have any detectable noise or issues depending on your situation you may need to have a external pop filter or windscreen however these microphones contain an internal windscreen a loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted works great in intervals though too bad those intervals are minutes these cables work well in my jam space they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in gig ing but at the price that s fair don t get me wrong these are good cables and for the price i am very happy i d buy more for sure i would probalby uses these for gigging as well if i didn t have heavier duty jumpers available as the title says these are a great value and work well it stopped working after gigs i m not sure why but it is very frustrating i guess you get what you pay for here picked up this set of cords for a gig i had at a large hotel event there were audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages we had channels running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board the video mix board and then the house mix board i had returns a e for my subwoofer monitor mixes and a stereo main mix i used a different color cable for each function i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars bass and keyboards all of the cables worked perfectly the video mix guy asked me where i got the cables from so he could get a set for himself these cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear down already had sets so i ordered one more set for my studio so i can find connections that much easier great set of cables this box is what i have been missing out of my setup always getting the question can i hook my keyboard into your sound board feel good to say that now i have the capability now can t say much more than the description it s a cheap box that works nothing fancy and not for everyone if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
607	it does exactly what it says it does my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower but very pleased it s cheap and works like a champ as a new guitar player i have a lot to learn and after nearly dropping my guitar twice in about minutes because the strap sliding off the pegs research was needed based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised would buy these again if when i acquire new guitars very beatiful and good quality nothing bad to say it s a fender strap with the hard rock leather look highly recommended after years of playing i rather choose this small and strong accessory to take care of my precious guitars and basses they seem the same but the original schallers that came with my tele deluxe are bigger and stronger for the lack of a better word still a good buy excellent stomp box you can dial it right in to get that srv sound very sturdy and very well made a must have for any blues player i was hesitant to purchase this as i really like the display of the previous models at first it seems like it might be less accurate it has less granularity in the display for example however it does seem to respond noticeably faster it appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes and it may in fact be more precise though it takes learning how to work with the display on earlier snarks the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note and they seemed pretty dead on especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string but i also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over tune though once you get used to it it is easily avoided anyway on this unit i am not sure what each bar represents but it is very sensitive if the string is not quite perfect the on pitch bar will be lit up but so will one next to it then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on then only the on pitch bar will be lit unless you turn too far and the result sounds really right i think i ll be putting one of these on most instruments from now on you get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your stratocaster however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard other than the two missing screws this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your stratocaster finally decided in getting the mm picks because i don t like them too thin or too thick this was the perfect gauge i was looking and hoping for the logo will wear out in a few uses but i don t much about that been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it s not wearing out too fast recommended my frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets i recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright incredible this was a filler item for a much larger order i am very interested in the straplocks so i decided to give them a try i sincerely like the concept what a fantastic product i believe i have been wishing for this for years only one problem make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot no longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal board i have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is t u f f i you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product still holding strong building another board and using this stuff it s much better than regular velcro i don t have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away
608	this pedal is ok by which i mean i provides the basic functions it says it does quality wise it feels a bit cheapish i was afraid i was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it the case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from the power switch and chorus vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find and are not that easily accessible by a toe you gotta bend over and flip those they are small on the other hand it was only sixty nine bucks relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedal i don t care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks that s not pedal board friendly in my opinion nice as a tabletop effect the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about x approx the standard v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun if you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation echos vibratos reverbs old style choruses this is not a bad way to get started playing with that you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank personally i have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space so for me not a keeper your situation might be different than mine not a bad product acceptable at it s price point just didn t impress me much when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psu sb otherwise the time machine works fine as described this pedal is amazing it has so many functions unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it i was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet i keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget it stays in tune and don t let the laminated top scare you its great
609	well hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one i bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs and it is a nightmaregoing on a week now no support help from either company heed my warning if you want to use this with ni ez drummer or other programs like that you must know how to reroute mapping of midi in order to use it this is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software there is very little helpful info out on the net i ve owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item there really is no midi support im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back alesis could have made this an amazing item and times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers if you don t like loading up the tuners trim a few inches off the leads they re about inches and have no cloth covering like fenders i usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the flexsteels have overall less tension i let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing yeah ironic for a set designed for slapping gave them a good stretch and they re holding pitch well i find the windings on the flexsteels more comfortable than rotosounds at least comparing new to new that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting overall i m more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there s plenty of piano low end sproing squire lake and ray bennett fans will feel right at home fingers or pick the set is so bright sounding in fact i had to roll a considerable amount off the label says light top medium bottom i found the gauge balance between the low e a and the high d g a little more pronounced than i d like but not outright uncomfortable for the money it costs it worth it the construction seems good especially the kick drum pedal but the brains leave a little to be desired although it s very functional the biggest complaint i have is that it only has stereo out and headphones out really should be mono or stereo i bought a separate plug to allow this so i could put it into my mixer and i m good i ll try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic the adjustability is wonderful and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box that being said one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them i ll soon contact the company for a replacement the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard and even then it s no guarantee and i m guessing due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads the snare often activates when i strike the hi hat at first glance the different tone kits don t bring much to the table but there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls to a small extent i ve even been able to cover up the less than responsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces my only other complaint is that the bass drum doesn t bring much to the table it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box but it s still fun to use so unless you plan to record with your electronic kit i d recommend this product as a fun musical toy but it s certainly not up to par with some of the more expensive kits i ve used and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare i like that this is fairly light it works as expected and has not given me any problems i recommend this item
610	i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar he said that you can hear the guitar but barely it does not stick on to the guitar very well trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet bought a better pickup the suction cup does not work it looks like aged it s very hard with room temp f i removed the rubber suction cup and i have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge it picks up sound ok but not great
611	i bought this to try out on my baritone uke it works great and is very easy to use i use it with my fender mustang i had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my martin dx i was able to attach it to the smoother hpl back and sides using the suction cup i wet it before attaching you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc for trouble mounting it could be used on just about any instrument some may need a clamp it picks up anything it is attached to it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp pretty cool nice price i know when i ordered it i was buying a cheap device and didn t expect it to be great it works that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy other than that an excellent value does what it says i live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do this is obviously higher quality well made a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one pros i bought this pedal primarily in place of a volume pedal or swell pedal because it does that function fairly well and a lot cheaper aside from that it also does nearly every other type of delay needed the tape digital analog switch slightly changes the sound of each delay the trails feature can be useful for holding a sound in swell mode with high repeats when the pedal is off and then playing over it with notes or harmony the time knob acts like an analog knob pitch shifting when turned after playing a note the repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation sometimes runaway depending on the delay type the mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signal stereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itwhile the pedal has small problems it compensates by inexpensive fixescons the modulation is a kind of adjustable width depth all in one knob and isn t the best compared to a chorus pedal just a general warblethe blue led is very bright to the point where you can t see the settings on the knobs so i cover it with a sticker it still shows through enough haha the casing is plastic but it is thick and durable enough maybe not for consistent gigging being a digital effect the footswitch is not state dependent in other words if you turn off the pedal unplug it and plug it back in the pedal will turn on because it is buffered bypass the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it even when off the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch and then lift up there is no noticeable click when you change delay type however the led flashesother notes almost half the weight of the pedal is the bottom metal plate the pedal without it feels shockingly lightweight but with it has a good amount of heft i originally rated this pickup stars however after using it for some time on dulcimers a mandolin and acoustic guitars some problems have turned up basically the cherub is just too sensitive it works well at lower volumes but as soon as you crank it up feedback city that you can not stop easily i put a rubber inner tube from a bike to reduce the sensitivity but still feed back and funny sound if you are looking for a pickup to use at a dance or some other loud venue the cherub will likely squeal as you crank it up it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup you can talk into your instrument i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic learned my lesson should of just forked over the money for an a e i have a yamaha f i really like i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i d try it i first picked up a transducer for about and experimented i like it sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i d try it installing it wasn t bad except i bought a set of drill bits i didn t need for so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright i just wanted it for playing around at home so i didn t need real great sound quality but sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector my other complaint is i couldn t turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching overall product quality is good setup was ok price was good sound in my opinion needs some tweaking a little patients sanding the saddle to fit my vintage guild better fit than the plastic original that it replaced and the sound expanded beyond my expectations i also replaced the bridge pins with tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone the fact that it is passive really kills it i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar i have both the fender g dec and the and the line spider jam just blows them away the controls are much more intuitive than the g dec line like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so i could hear my guitar over it and i was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks or drum beats i wanted and the only time i had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easy i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line once you go further into the amp and get into the dubbing recording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedal the amp can get really loud and i don t see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side show since i have only had the amp for a short time i can t say anything about how it will holdup but i have other amps by different companies and the quality is just fine by the way i have a g dec for sale addendum the following is my take between the jam and the series do with it as you wish a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years the spider does not have on board song or drum loops like the spider jam if you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then the isyour amp if you need a practice amp go with the jam i have both amps and as far as i am concerned the jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the spider does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the spider technology with a jm looper as its engine while the spider i have the is a nice amp it is very specific to the user needs and isnot that flexible i do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as i used the jam for a longtime without and only acquired the express pedal when i ordered the spider also be very aware that the line documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there so called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation this is a hit or miss product for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well it s not a total loss since i can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution i ended up with it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on
612	this mike is a great way to start recording at home i use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball i know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price however i find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home i bought this to complement a ce ltd fall guitar and wanted to have something that would last a long time and provide a nice suede feel to keep the strap from sliding around on my shoulder it took a little bit to get the hole over the butt peg of the guitar it almost seemed the slit they cut was too small after working at it a few minutes i got it to fit and it wore really nicely once i got the length where i wanted taking it on off the guitar isn t too much trouble but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more enough to make it easier to get it on i m glad that it came a little tighter initially the leather stretches over time and it s clear they had that in mind when they make these the quality is excellent and i m buying another one to go with my string taylor i bought this strap for my taylor guitar it s a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft as it says it is made to fit well on taylor guitars but can fit in any other guitar as well the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted highly recommended nice to see something well made for a change most guitar straps i see that are less than are all cheap and that fake stuff i can see this strap lasting a long time i love how i don t need new strap buttons considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor you can lock each strap button with one hand great product
613	i ve been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them i figured i d try some others at half the price and see if any stack up these were the first to go on and they were a huge step down from what i had on the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high e string they were twice as loud as these when you take these out of the pack they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti they don t do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do the cons definitely outweigh the pros here pros very flexible string bends are easy easy on the fingerscons the most dull sound of any strings i ve ever heard especially on the low end they re dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound the highs are very tinny almost sounds like a bad recording your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings it s the weirdest thing this is especially true for the g string it s hard to explain but it s kind of like rubbing against something really clean where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there s tons of squeak to boot anyways it sucks grip is the last thing you want on your strings bottom line unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings these should not be purchased i ll never buy again this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings i ve bought quite a few tuners over the years these are small responsive easy to read and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference these are great at first i was turned off by the toyish appearance but decided to try it after reading the reviews let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics and they perform way better than i expected this amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from modelling amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five flavor settings in each they are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you ve switched gears here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you d have to be right up on them to see how they are set i ve had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned it s velcroed on there just fine the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather like material plenty loud
614	pack of guitar picks check meet the beatles theme checkretail packaging checktwo day delivery got it the next day thanks to prime checkhappy guitarist checki can t really complain about anything except maybe for the price but then again i didn t have to buy these they are fun and kitschy stars this was a gift for a friend who is a beatles fan i bought him two different types he he liked them both these will not be used much i you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand this is it tripod legs are stable and also adjusts up and down to about inches or so it even comes with a case with two zippered sections one for the stand and and one for a mic there is also amic holder what a find i will probably get another i put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the g string and it sounds great what a buy for the price you may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot whatever spot you find is best for you it s worth it i m going to try it on my reso uke next i d say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection i don t use them all too often because they re a bit too stiff though if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller i just received my pack planet waves beatle collectors pick graphics are great it s a great little collection only thing that i didn t like was that you didn t get separate ones they are all duplicates so besides that they are great
615	if you are like me that you love playing music this is a good buy it pretty much does what it s supposed to so you plug it and it s ready to use it s pretty fast and accurate for it s price light weight the only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the th string overall it s good enough to buy it this isn t the best power supply available it doesn t truly isolate each input the description says the outputs are isolated but what this means is that they are independent that is if one input has a short in it that one will cease to function and not the other working inputs so the short circuit protection is isolated but the grounding is not this can cause some issues with noise but there are other things that can cause noise too it s not always just the power supply making the noise it could be certain pedals cables or some combination of factors a power conditioner will sometimes help as well however the joyo provides plenty of power enough for v inputs and each of v and v it is dependable solidly built comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards i have x pedals on my board with of these joyo units and my board is about x there is some noise but i don t attribute that just to the power supply it takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down i m not sure it can ever be completely eliminated but the joyo itself seems to produce very little and it s a third to half the price of the truly isolated units and a definite step up from a daisy chain it also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off i wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after i change guitars i bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap it has served it s purpose and i use it nearly everyday very happy with purchase it can be an octave divider up to two up or down it can do parallel intervals a la trevor rabin on owner of a lonely heart it can do intelligent harmonies just make sure your guitar is in tune so it can track your playing it can do digitech whammy esque divebombs up or down it can do chorus like detuningit can do whammy bar flutter copiesit s a bargainit s very welcome on my pedalboardif it s what you re looking for it s not lexicon it s not tc nor does it profess to be and you know how to use it you really can t go wrong get one and have fun because it s not programmable i m getting another this behringer compressor sustainer compare s to the boss cs the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone compression level is very good and all for not putting down the boss but for this price you can t go wrong i ve heard about the snark tuners before and have seen them once in awhile but while skimming the music side of amazon i finally picked this up and it works great very durable and flexible if you are looking for something nice and strong get this cables i bought this audio cable and all i gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble good stuff i ve been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now this pedal completed that task it s hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect very punchy and crisp you can t go wrong with behringer pedals they are plastic though so they might not hold up under heavy road use but for home studios they are perfect highly recommended great leather strap nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth it wont dig in ur shoulder like some other straps out there and u can adjust it i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i don t like to play low like to my knees that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and it gives me a great angle for my wrist to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck so i say great buy i give it stars it cuts down the buzz left by the other pedals for that price it s pretty good not badly built either these strings are beyond amazing switching to ernie ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar and if you do any blues playing at all extra slinkies are for you they bend and bend and bend are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos and give a great sound whether you re playing gritty or bright i also play country and punk and these strings let me get enough twang and beef respectively to play those styles as well the best you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put ernie ball strings on your guitar very handy has multiple benefits that are very useful i just had to loosen the screw that holds the winder a bit and lubricated it with silicone spray and done deal a bit heavy and doesn t fold up to be very compact but its not like there are any better options out there so would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but havent used it yet seems like a nice pedal nice an lightweight clean has some nice rubber on the bottom lol haha okaaaaaay
616	if you ve never had a pedalboard before i d say pass on this one and look for one that is more user friendly the pics and description don t show just how insanely large this is it s too big patch cables are crap and the power supply didn t seem sturdy enough to be kicked around besides this i had trouble using it even for practice because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals i ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a gator bone and a seperate power supply easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it s own this is a very good investment everything just sits in this case so i never have to set up any cables again all i do is setup the input from guitar to the case from the case to the amp and let s not forget the power cable it works amazing and saves plenty of time i ve also seen reviews that it s very druable so you don t have to worry about it breaking easily i love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals such as wah or volume the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing i replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals and the sound went away i would recomment this to anyone who travels alot doesn t have a lot of space in their room or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time this item is very convienent
617	nice thumbpicks for banjo they are size large so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you i have a larger hand and they work well but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug but i like them a lot would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that s whay you re into though i always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick i really like this thumb pick the only thing i dispute is that this may be a large for a girl but no way is it a large for a man i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably so ladies this is a good purchase not so much for a guy these are fine but didn t fit well but they are a quality product in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight i ve used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars my thumb nail can t pluck the strings when i damp them with the heel of my hand these are adequate in the sense that you can strike the strings with them and they stay on they have a dullish sound compared to my favorite the long gone national clear thumb pick or the current dunlop clear i like the sound of the ernie ball thin celluloid picks but they aren t strong enough to grip my thumb the major problem with these is they aren t large they re like most other brands medium my thumbs aren t tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average these picks cut off the circulation in my thumb if i use them for more than fifteen minutes or so i think i could brighten up the sound by sanding them down but that s a lot of work for something this cheap don t buy these if you have a large thumb if you like a less bright sound and some people do and have a medium sized thumb these might work well for you for the multi guitar owners i think this is great all i was looking for something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tone volume changes set up single coil and another line humbucker or p guitar and have the same volumes excellent and space saver sure there s a lot more options but not likely ill use just to make guitar switching easy good deal been using these for longer than a decade and met many people who prefer minimal picks and jazz iii among them this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get this is actually the first capo i have ever owned as i am pretty new to playing the guitar that being said i paid close to with free shipping for this capo and i feel it is a good value it feels well constructed like it won t break if i drop it the capo fits nice and tight on all six strings ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar s neck the spring mechanism is plenty tight but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed even while playing the capo is sleek looking and a bit smaller than i was expecting at x but i have no frame of reference for comparison item was shipped on time and packaged in the original dunlop packaging part number cb made in usa no counterfeit here if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will answer as best i can thanks for reading spo they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
618	v starbugera customer service starslets be realistic this is a very inexpensive tube amp nothing more nothing less its price reflects exactly what it is and thats a good thing and also not so good first off the amp shipped with bad tubes microphonic not a big deal it happens all the time but bugera was no help at all their customer service is by far the worst ive ever dealt with they are clueless arrogant and condescending i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugera behringer product now about the amp itself its ok at best it has no headroom even on the w setting i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it you will only get a muddy garbled mess clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there think of marshall cleans or even vox the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from i plugged the amp into a celestion x cab just for comparison and it was a whole lot better its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more if youre looking for a vintage tube amp but either cant afford or cant justify the price of a good one you should try a v im the latter because i only play at home i simply cant justify k or more for a good tube amp the classic overdrive sound of the s is all over this amp if youre looking for a late s s cranked amp stack tone well its here but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low turn up the preamp and all you ll get is a flat flubby farty unusable tone i love and hate the v though the price is unbeatable its shortcomings no headroom horrid overdrive are hard to live with you sometimes what you pay for and in this case if you want that vintage s tone at bedroom volumes you cant go wrong with the v these are a good value for quality strings strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in i m very satisfied good all around mike if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio i recommend this one best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals best mike for the price and purpose this mic is fantastic i ve been singing writing and recording for almost years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive german mics i ve used in larger studios over the years there s a very slight presence peak but nothing like most of the other chinese mics it isn t shrilling or peaky at all male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for eq whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub hz stuff this mic is also an excellent candidate for a michael joly mod he calls it one of the audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under michael mods these mics and you d be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous u with the german name that starts with an n i m using it totally stock and it s been great buy it i d give this baby six stars if i could my prior practice amp a vox was very nice but finally went south and required replacement i was looking for something with a great tube sound as most of the solid state amps that i ve used mainly fenders and line stuff just don t get there i was actually looking at the fender blues junior and headed to my local gc to check em out and listen side by side the first time i plugged a strat into this guy in the store i was blown away and that was with all of the jimmy page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store i ve gotta say part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a blues junior but the bugera actually sounded better the only one left in the store was the floor model so i grabbed it got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations it s solid and heavy it s still a small fry slightly bigger than most w amps out there but much heavier the construction is great i think i read some reviews that knocked the construction but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it s built to last the sound is even better at home without the gc cacophony adjustments are minimal but enough the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp i ve run my strat tele and taylor t through this i think the hard bodies get the best blues tone but i can get a really nice clean tone from my t the headphones sound great i was really surprised by this i would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones the price is self explanatory but that s really the part that blew me away this amp would sell for double the price tag i admit i got this from guitar center on clearance but over the past week or so i ve had it i just love plugging into it i ve got a great vintage larger amp but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions and i m anticipating spending some time in apartment living so i was looking for a small tube based amp this thing gives great tone with both a strat and a les paul clone and an overdrive pedal works very well with it of course it s not too loud that s the whole point i should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps don t have but it s really low volume also the tubes do take a minutes to warm up and since it doesn t have a standby switch you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in but it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears or those of anyone else great little amp
619	this is a highly feature full amp at this price point i can get great clean blues and heavy metal tones like most line products some features are not highly apparent for example for extra gain you can hold down the tuner button and turn the gain knob past o clock for a boost this may not sound like much but it really can change the tone even on clean channels on the crunch channel for example it gives the guitar an almost fuzz face overdriven sound with my strat on the metal channels it really drives the gain over the top the tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are ok i decided to go with the cheaper fbv pedal which is still over the price of this amp and it really works well for home practice situations one can switch between clean and metal or clean and blues without too much trouble one click i think the pedals are too expensive personally but they are well constructed solid steel and seem very durable the cable is a simple cat network cable i believe so replacing should be trivial i live in an apartment and this little watt amp is way too loud to turn up past or it has a great tone balance to my ears it has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesn t overall i recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp i swear by these strings these are the only strings i will use on my les paul their bright tone sounds great and full while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze don t buy these strings just because i like them buy them because they suit you because you like the tone they provide because they feel good against your fingers cons what cons try them never has watts sounded so loud and clear never think it only hadan inch speaker just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices light weight easy to carry this amp really shines in the distortion modes i don t really care for the clean sounds but the metal tones are as good as i ve ever heard out of a low cost amp i wish i had found this amp sooner it blows the other brands away i just got it today and haven t spent too much time with it yet it sounded ok and i like the features on it i especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal as soon as you press down it s on lots of adjustments so i ll be tweaking for a while to find my sound but it seems like it s going to be ok it s a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve for the money it s a great pedal great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f perfectly solid and steardy case that will last a very long time i read the reviews here on amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn t expensive i only needed one and expected the package to come with just one but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise i ve had them for months now and they haven t failed me yet they keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and i had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor the only complaint i have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick and they are an extremely snug fit which makes me kinda nervous however i keep them as tight as i can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints this same chord was almost bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you won t trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today
620	double bass pedal has a quality build solid frame quiet mechanism easy to build and breaksdown for transport solid attachment to bass drum easy to adjust with reversible mallets as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value very nice strap is comfortable as this type of strap can be it will with heavier guitars feel like its wearing on you after about an hour i ended up switching to their padded strap i still think this is a great strap and use it on a lighter guitar now i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions it looks really good sturdy and well made is super stable i tried it out with strats and a electro acoustic then removed one strat and placed another acoustic a string this time i pushed the stand and it holds as guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar bass or whatever you put in there falls down you can set the height always considering that your guitars don t reach the floor so totally recommended i m a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars i learned a long time ago that guitar like instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung this is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but i also thought the instrument would double as wall art so when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric acoustic uke from hawaii i immediately went shopping for a wall hanger there are more expensive ones out there but this wooden string swing turned out to be perfect easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall call me a satisfied customer jm tepper this is a distortion pedal it will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl it s pretty harsh in tone kind of a white noise distortion the ds does not warm up the tone in your amp you can dial the tone in but it s a pretty harsh sounding that said the ds does exactly what i wanted it to my amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style the ds gives me the s metal and punk rock sound i wanted and it does so flawlessly it took me about minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the ds it s boss so it will last forever th only drawback is that it s an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere usually amazon catches up with that sort of thing but word to the wise don t pay more than new for this thing first i bought a fm dsp on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store that was my mistake i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks well here it is friends in all it s glory tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price it s loud it s clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it add a danelectro distortion pedal of some sort off amazon for distortion and you re home i own nine amps including fender crate and peavey tube models and this is cleaner if you play c w look no further if you fingerpick this is your amp electrified banjo mandolin or violin this is the amp but if you follow the darker side keep looking wow this little amp packs tons of tone sound hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully the clean channels are really clean the dirty channels are just plain nasty watts is enough power to blow your socks off lots of bang for the buck here i own several tube amp combo and half stack however i wanted a smaller lighter combo that would be easy to transport and wouldn t need any pedals but would also be loud enough to practice with a drummer the line spider iv watt combo was the perfect solution up to this point i haven t been very impressed by solid state technology sure the cleans are glassy and crystal clear and some sound ok with the gain cranked and mids scooped at super low volume but as soon as you turn up the volume a bit or try to dial in a smooth bluesy overdrive the sound turns to crap not so with the spider iv i ve been extremely impressed with all the different amp models all of them the different amp models each have their unique sound and characteristics which means that your tonal options are literally limitless i play mostly metal and hard rock thougn i use less gain and more mids than is typical among players of the genre i d describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge and i was able to get that tone in less than a minute of fiddling the tone in general is surprisingly warm and organic very tube like which is a comparison that i don t make lightly additionally the highs don t have that artificial tinny sound that so often occurs in solid state solos and leads have more of the natural smooth quality that tube amps are valued for the effects are fun to play with though i ve never used many effects in my playing i really like having multiple user pre sets so i can dial in the tones that i use the most and then switch between them at the press of a button the artist pre sets are cool it s interesting to see line s take on the sound of many popular bands and songs some are surprisingly good like cliffs of dover master of puppets and sunshine of your love while others don t really sound like the artist like killswitch engage i m also impressed with the quality of the celestion speaker that comes with the amp it holds up pretty well even at higher volumes the tone has continually improved as i ve broken in the speaker just in conclusion there s basically nothing this amp can t do at least fairly well all the amp models actually sound good can t say the same about my roland cube and when you combine that with all the effects tuner mp connection and user and song artist presets it s a winning combination this will never be my main stage amp but for practice purposes i couldn t be more pleased with the spider iv edited to add a few months later i bought the fbv express pedal board it s a simple affordable way to get more out of the amp by making channel switching easy and adding a volume wah pedal especially if this is your main amp i recommend getting a fbv pedal to go with it
621	i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions it looks really good sturdy and well made is super stable i tried it out with strats and a electro acoustic then removed one strat and placed another acoustic a string this time i pushed the stand and it holds as guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar bass or whatever you put in there falls down you can set the height always considering that your guitars don t reach the floor so totally recommended d addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and i have yet to find a better buy i m a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars i learned a long time ago that guitar like instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung this is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but i also thought the instrument would double as wall art so when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric acoustic uke from hawaii i immediately went shopping for a wall hanger there are more expensive ones out there but this wooden string swing turned out to be perfect easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall call me a satisfied customer jm tepper this foot controller is wonderful switch between all four channels and the volume pedal wah pedal and built in tuner makes it the complete package for my line amp this tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar it gets the job done easily and very fast i use this for working on my guitars mainly it does the job well and is pretty large it s very soft and padded as well as anti static i think this guitar rest is pretty nice it doesn t attach on the table very good though so don t rely on this thing too much
622	i used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics it was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do highly recommended i am proud to have this product fits my fender well looks amazing great quality in it also i am pleased been golding up an strat plus that has seen better days wiith the gold pick guard tuning pegs and jack plate it looks like a custom shop job this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance the goods are up to scratch and fit properly good service product packing and delivery time recommend them if you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar
623	not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob there its that this mic for my use is useless it records tooo low cant get enough volume from it bought for my son to do game capture voice overs the first day it was fine if a bit sensitive by the third day it was broken cheap to buy but cheaply made no problems with seller and product came quick i wasnt expecting much from the mic i mean c mon what can you expect for that price i wanted it to lay down some quick vocal melodies over rough tracks and it s good enough for that doesn t have a really great range i think the rockband mic has a better range than this but like i said it s a cheap mic so what can you expect honestly i should have saved my money and been a little more patient to get a better mic i absolutely love these strings they enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought they last a long time and they keep their great sound for a long time if there was a way to give stars i would i m surprised that the maker of amazon s popular at would go this low the mic imo is fully valued even at its single digit price it s dynamic rather than condenser but it still requires loads of power to get it up to workable levels phantom power which is a requirement for condenser mics would probably not add sufficient heft it s very lightweight and with its optional plug and on off switch is versatile enough the quality of the sound moreover isn t bad providing you can hear it be prepared to have plenty of watts on hand to coax any appreciable sensitivity from this non responsive creature i haven t tested it for recording purposes despite appearances this mic is no bargain
624	this tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tune it is good deal for the money it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later this product was recommended to me by one of the books i am reading and i must admit i was scared to death when i opened the package my guitar has a built in tuner so i found my room mate s guitar that was totally out of tune and just began tuning i remembered eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie and just tuned away it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments money very well spent and highly recommended i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard could not be any happier get this product i ve had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap durable and reasonably accurate i own several different tuners and what i like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it at ten dollars i think it s a no brainer it s the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own bought this distortion pedal for our son who plays his electric guitar daily he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use it also produces a nice distorted sound quality and tone i don t know if i would agree as my generation hails from a different genre of music but he loves it and i guess that s all that matters i got mine yesterday and love it it sounds grate i didn t know what amp to get i looked and looked read a lot of reviews and even got on youtube to see what people had to say and seems this one had a lot of good reviews i knew fender has a good name for amps and for the money this one was the one i am so glad i got it it gave life to my electric guitar i bought mine somewhere else but still grate amp i didn t want to spend a lot of money for an amp and didn t want to get something small for or dollars less and would out grow with my music as i get better playing guitar but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will this will save me money in the long run i am very happy with it i like the five year warranty that came with it you can t go wrong great sound and its not to big nice size amp and easy to pick up nice looking amp in the beginning i had problems however i have a classical guitar and i may have been hitting dual strings accidently at first after several days i felt much better about it i m pretty new to this so i take the blame rogue g w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing actually it s loud enoucht for home recommend it unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes am totally pleased that i did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it works great get one these cables are perfect the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent i really love monster cables i paid dollars for this it must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it s not cheap at all folds up for transport works great on hardwood floors padded where it needs to be and has a strap so it doesn t fall forward either angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet look for something where the legs enter the carpet more straight down i suppose it does what it is suppose to do it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if i want to spend more bucks for a better one wow is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a string endless beauty when you here the tones produced by elixer elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag you can not go go with a set or two of elixers wow this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio it gets used daily if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it they won t be disappointed unless they tune below drop d i have bought of these now for me and a few friends and they work great i am sure they will wear out in time so i have a couple extras but you can t beat them
625	very comfortable lightweight strong good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall affordable and comes in many colors i was looking for a portable fold up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around found the guardian at amazon and thought for how could i go wrong oops wrong the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely but i found it next to impossible to get my fender jazz bass to stand up in it the lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn t blow this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don t care too much about but for for an electric guitar or bass no way i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support live and learn i am self taught guitar for about months without this i would be lost i work with a guy who has played guitar for years he tunes it to itself when i had him try my tuner he found that his guitar was tuned to itself yet so far off for you cant beat this don t be so cheap buy this and enjoy it
626	smooth sound and attack grips soft loose and yet well i own hundreds of picks these are some of my favorites these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice i really dig these i have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks and the worst thing is that when i drop them they are impossible to find on my beige carpet the one i m using has barely worn with at least hours of playing on it the size of the pick is the same as normal it is just more tapered i tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it but it was a little to much work as i dipped it too far into the strings so i reverted back to a wider gator grip which works better with the bigger strings i am still searching for the world s perfect all purpose pick this works until then nice pic s that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
627	i like this product the screen is big and easily read the meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle the note sharp or flat and by the background color going green to red it takes seconds to hear the string but then it locks right in for all notes even the low e it s really easy to use and i m really happy with it its so much better than my korg ca the only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel it takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position an additional swivel would make it perfect it tunes my ukuleles it tunes my guitar i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch hooray for this tuner i could not be happier once in a while it will catch ambient sounds but i love this tuner it does not eat up battery power and keeps me tuned right on a bit better than snark but if you love saying snark just get snark my wife plays the fiddle and the mandolin and this stand works great for both of them it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn t very friendly snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down it works fine but it s inconvenient i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa i don t think that many people would do this the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box it works for me i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp i bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well i like the thickness of this pick easy to hang onto when strumming love the tone i can obtain too piece of plastic with no bracing due to design will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf which is most quality stands i used double sided sticky tape problem solved gives me a place to stow my guitar picks tuner capo and pencil and as such is an invaluable accessory worth the bucks just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand
628	this pad is great for midi vsti s drums queuing and it s got great action works great with ableton reason fl studio cantabile performer and a whole bunch more daws and hosts the software is a little lame and doesn t always work properly but you don t really need it that much anyways so it s whatever this small device has amazing quality the built in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand held mono recorders mic gain controls boost volume but add some noise like reviews state but when used on low gain record quite well audio in records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer i used a behringer u for amazingly clear recordings several types of sdhc cards work well and have not found a card that did not work with this device even nimh v batteries can power this although alkaline v last longer con the plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully i own a native instruments maschine mikro but find myself using this even more often you can program it to whatever midi values you want the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive cant go wrong great quality on a budget price hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up i love the pads and the knobs i used it with live the software side requires a bit of configuration to work with some software but ultimately was stable and functional except with my laptop the usb power supply must be noisy because the lpd will lose its connection and power if you even gently touch one of the cables however it works fine if i use a very cheap powered usb hub in between i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply so it may not work in some configurations lose a star because i really love it but in my configuration i am not willing to add a gratuitous usb hub and another wall wart to my road rig nice try akai updated update jan i have tried a different lpd to compare it does not have the problem on the systems where my old lpd would be flaky the new lpd is rock solid it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem if yours has this problem send it back while it s still in warranty so that s nice now it s really a great product that i can um sort of recommend to everyone however considering that akai professional has us doing their qc for them i d suggest saving the shipping box in case you need to return it for an exchange at least for a few weeks
629	if you are looking for a leather mandolin strap consider another strap the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man made material glued to the thin leather part i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut i share most of the same sentiments the pads are a little stiff but this works does the job and is such a small package fit s in my macbook bag i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm or similar dynamic microphone but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power into a plug n play usb mic should not be taken at face value i say this because i have an acquaintance with the original audio technica at condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion in the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks by purchasing the at usb mic as it is the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the comparably priced lightsnake cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read so if necessary give it a try and more than one but make sure there are return privileges if you want u kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob for the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget
630	thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly maybe my hands are just sweaty it works perfect with cakewalk music creator and a digitech vocalist best price out there used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older strat type guitar and it sounds great the diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original chinese pot so i needed a cheap reamer purchased through amazon to enlarge the pickguard hole it s a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness nice big lugs to solder to
631	great strings with a good feel to them they are size which is just right for my electric guitars i won t know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey if they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and i will switch if they last a long time i don t think of these as extra lights they are more of a light to me this thing is amazing love the sound it produces well made like a tank real quality expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time the effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while i just couldn t live with it just got this it is my first pedal of any sort it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with i just plug in my headphones and i am off in my own world when i play i can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever i want or at least get close to what i want i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didn t
632	these are really cheap strings but how they sound really good obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse these are the ones its just a basick thin leather strap my only problem with it is it could be longer my bass sits to high with this strap set at its longest setting i have schaller security strap locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase schallers for that one soon these give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place my larrivee rs came with these and converted me to schaller it didn t seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless it may work well with dunlop picks but not for theplanet waves standard guitar picks duralin blue gt medium heavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold it has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot i ve found it mostly not useful thus far maybe it would help more when playing live so i can grab for a pick and know they will be there actually they re not fender they are schaller but that is really good looks great in my fender squier highly recommended i ve got three of these simply because they work and they re easy to carry from place to place and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this leaning stuff my wife was worried about what to get me for christmas i really didn t want anything other than the harley i have been asking for for years maybe next and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul i had to laugh since it looks so much like my gibson les paul kind of like a mini me version well i have never heard of a les paul uke and did not think for that it would be much but the reviews were telling a different story so i found my christmas present at last for the man who has everything it is true my wife told me still hoping for that harley though i ordered it a few days before christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife s dismay but i printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway well christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing the uke not the harley but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when i opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby les paul i figured since i was taking my fellow amazonian s word i better order some aquila ukulele strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the uke are junk and they are shame of epiphone which i did the uke arrived about days before the strings but i attempted to learn how to play it anyway ouch those stock strings were rough on the fingers and the sound left much to be desired so i waited until the new string were installed prior to this review wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers i just love it now so if you decide to get one of these mini me les paul s do yourself a favor and get a set if aqila stringsaquila usa aquila concert ukulele stringsa snark uke tuner sn snark sn ukulele tunera nice leather guitar strapfender plain leather guitar strap with fender logo blackanda daily ukulele song book by jumpin jimthe daily ukulele songs for better living daily ukulele paperback you will love all of these items i am sure when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill see it on youtube it is a riot orjake shimabukuro bohemian rhapsody enjoy plain leather looks good and has the fender logo prominent no padding which may be a bit of a problem if you are playing long hours i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it solid good stand it is decent quality and doesn t have any places that will break easily can take anywhere you want
633	this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first i have no regrets all of the positive reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent guitar model are spot on if you re in the market and don t have a grand to spend on a new acoustic guitar get this north american made gem you won t regret it wow a bench that really holds my ass what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand and it was necessary to the group i m sure glad that i bought these straps there not leather but are put together very well i plan on using them as backups in the studio the price was just right cam quickly and i d buy them again
634	i ordered this tuner so i could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag it s worked fine i ve used it to tune a ukelele a bass and a guitar and it works fine on all counts i have no complaints about it this is a good item and has served me well however i just upgraded to an intellitouch pt for a bit more money and its a much more convenient and really easy to use the korg runs off of ambient sound and gets interference from background noise while the intellitouch is a clip on and uses vibration to hear the note double bass pedal has a quality build solid frame quiet mechanism easy to build and breaksdown for transport solid attachment to bass drum easy to adjust with reversible mallets as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value works well as a tuner but i did return it to buy the korg tuner metronome combo thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine however this worked fine as a plain tuner i prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it s inexpensive yet lightweight flexible and of more than acceptable quality the problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness which feels nice at first and feels more studio but when you re actually using the cable it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things for instance monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are for just a few bucks more i prefer pro co excellines since they have metal ends and their lifetime warranty is simpler just call sweetwater which feels nicer to me but i like these just fine this is a great strap nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible best part this strap gets long long long yep here it is
635	i ve got a couple of these and for the most part i m very satisfied on the mandy absolutely no problems on guitars it sometimes doesn t register on the low e usually moving around helps i had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified then it worked like a charm glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig i have owned my g th capo over a year now as far as i m concerned it beats all the others i ve owned in the past hands down so easy to use can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed i wasn t sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable but i am now it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp i did a little experiment i plugged in my old cable played the guitar as i adjusted the amp until i got a pleasant sound from the speakers then i turned the amp off unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new monster rock cable next i simply turned the amp back on the sound levels were already set and i did not touch them and played my guitar again the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable i m buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables i have owned just about every tuner made they all had pluses and minuses i like this one a lot it is my tuner of choice right now the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate it is also small which i appreciate for this price you simply can t go wrong like all of dunlop products this worked great it s real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance i m a dunlop fan i feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr oacute n which is at least as big as but much thicker than a cello but its design appeared amenable to some home modification that might make it work so at the price i took a chance and bought it well the back of my guitarr oacute n bulges out like a blowfish so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended my guitarr oacute n s body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks like they were made for that no modifications needed not even bending some reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over but i suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs completely open and therefore extended to its widest base if you don t really look closely as you open the legs you ll think you ve reached the stop before the legs are fully open i didn t have it fully open at first and it was a just a bit too easy to push over in my view but still acceptable when i discovered that i still had to open all three legs a bit more i retried it and it was much more steady that last mm of movement on each leg was worth improvement the stand is fully as steady as i had hoped it possibly could be especially given the price amazing anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all i even like the way it appears to physically clamp down my guitarr oacute n since it seemed to discourage itchy fingers from trying to pick it up while i was on break fender original parts can t be beat the philips head is an improvement over the vintage straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish these look like the have a nickel plating and i believe are or size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store but i chose fender original parts for the tele i recently finished and for the one i am currently working on whether you re a beginner or have been playing for a long time you can never go wrong with ernie ball strings i m enjoying using this priced right set of strings i put these strings on my martin guitar after receiving my new dvd from customerservice peghead nl entitled how to play fingerstyle guitar by eltjo haselhoff whose preview of this great dvd i found on youtube see the preview and look at other youtube videos of eltjo you ll want to order the dvd immediately i use this capo all the time on both instruments a friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also i did and they love it but not great either the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch it also appears that the tuner wasn t reliable on the pitch end either recently ordered the red snark tuner here on amazon and i think it s much better the intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it the snark is a little more bulky ultimately the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch and readability snark wins out this tuner works for sure but i don t think it s the best out there the snark is cheaper too i ve used d addario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic even though this string was my first time use and it haven t failed me yet it s very stable and in tune all time while playing highly recommand to other ppl i got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin sucked big time so we got this to use instead works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it i know everybody knows this already but i ve never played with a bow before most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers
636	bought this rosin to see how i would like it i have a very light hand on the bow so i like a rosin that is on the aggressive side this is not since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial error finally a product that is as simple to use as a point and shoot camera literally i opened the box put in two batteries the memory card read the quick start guide put the zoom on the included stand and got out my mandolin and started recording the sound quality is great and you can play it back directly on the zoom by plugging in some head buds included the control buttons operate like a dvd remote with a menu button using the fast forward and reverse to scroll through entries and the record button as the set for someone who is not well versed in audio terminology gain sampling rates mics pre post amps levels whatever i just set it to medium gain watched to make sure the lines don t go too far up and was recording away in two steps push record to test the gain level and push record again red light stays on to record and push record to stop the file is saved and then you can push play pause to listen back deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a vcr you can use this puppy it is also handy portable and easy to take places i will take it to record jam sessions music lessons and practice to evaluate my playing and instrument comparisons the sound quality is great and i could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is i wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise finger slide noise and other assorted twangs and twings it records both in wav huge files and mp compressed with various quality levels to choose from you can easily connect it to a computer windows mac with the included usb cable the only thing missing is a remote since you have to push the button on the recorder you have to move to it to activate deactivate it also picks up noise from your movements but for the price it s a real gem i always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise doesn t cost a lot and delights the customer on this one it is the included wind sock a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording cool i highly recommend these tuners they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin they also work well with acoustical guitar very good rosin and does exactly what is described a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows no need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity
637	well to date these snark tuners have got to be one of the best tuners i ve ever run across i highly recommend them especially the ones with the built in vibration sensor i am not an avid player but it fits good and for the price you can not beat it i thought it would not be as good but wow my surprise to it and the fit i have a violin i think handed down from my ggggrandfather the violin is so old can hardly tell what kind it is someone once told me it was one of those stratovariouses tempted to throw it out a couple of times but it is sentimental since it came from and handed down through the family should just pitch the thing but now i do have a nice shoulder comforter will definitely keep the shoulder thing even if i do pitch the violin for a nice shiney new one this string set offers typical d addario quality and value i use d addario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle this does work as described it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable its quite hard on your collarbone i have added foam to it and now it works well but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place rogue g w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing actually it s loud enoucht for home recommend it
638	i like this pedal its rugged and has a great range of tonal capabilities and rips for hardcore metal that being said the blue led while cool looking is actually blinding and i found myself placing a finger over it to just see the friggin knobs for adjustments i guess that is a pretty weak complaint but imo it s an impediment more than an enhancement also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me which is not expected at this price point a moot point because i am not using the gate at least as imo it was weird in its gating execution sounded kind of like a very rough algorithm is being used instead of a nice smooth curve but all in all this thing tears it up in terms of pure shredding tone bottom line up front if you play an orange vox or marshall you don t necessarily need an eq pedal but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level why is this well the brits design their amps with wide and musical eq but the overall frequency response is narrow this has led many british amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that british eq isn t as dramatic as american guitarists want it to be there is nothing wrong with this by any means it s just an overall characteristic of british amplifiers secondly any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost db seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty or dirty to overdrive or overdrive to distortion live performance if you re in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs you ve probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass midrange noise hz that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter applying eq to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low end from the picture and boosting your high end for better clarity recording direct in if you re using this pedal with a di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping you ll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your strat or brighten your les paul why stars yes the noise it s not bothersome by any means but if you re recording with a mic d amp or direct in you will absolutely need a noise suppressor i use my ge with the boss ns and the ns completely removes the white noise generated from the ge the result is an amazing clean boosting eq if you re on the fence go ahead and get this thing you won t regret it it s not just for tone snobs it can really make cheap gear sound way better and take great gear to the next level this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need i would personally recommend the electro harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price tis pedal really did for me what i wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines i don t mess with the noise gate so i can t really comment on that but everything else is first rate cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use still highly recommended for the money the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic a lot of people like the metal muff over this and say you can dial in more distortion sounds well i have both the muff is good for various tones but the mxr gives you that all out full metal tone having the built in gate is also nice and it works the muff is a lot more noisy but i like em both i just use them for different tones if you want that full out metal tone get this trust me
639	for those that want to record i use adobe audition this item is good for recording i use to use my sound card this provides a smoother sound and i don t have to worry about hissing when i record you can just plug in your guitar or bass here is a letter i wrote to tascam on humble advice i would forward this email to all of your subsidiaries any retail store that sells tascam usb audio devices anywhere in the world just today i got the new tascam us usb audio interface it of course uses the windows audio drivers a nightmare occured when i plugged in the device windows xp had the usual detect usb device come up but to my horror it wound up saying a hardware problem occured your hardware may not operate properly something of that sort i spent over hours trying to figure this whole thing out and i read the manual it came with tried all sorts of things oh brother it still would not install by the way this happened with a previous usb audio device not made by tascam that did the excact same thing on my computer but to my luck i found out what the problem was thank god for the website that had this on a blog in the c windows inf folder there must exist two files wdma usb infwdma usb pnfit is really the inf file that is important some software seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdma usbinf bakwdma usbpnf baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us worked its easy to rename the files you just open wdma usbinf bakwdma usbpnf bak and then save them as wdma usb infwdma usb pnf its that simple anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this like i said it happend with a previous usb audio device that i had and i woulnd up selling it at ebay cause i was so frustrated i m happy with the tascam us i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer and it did the same with a usb phone we picked up the xcg guitar stand for my daughter s acoustic guitar and it is exactly what was needed here are my observations pros stable once setup and tightened down this is very sturdy adjustable the height and base can be configured to accommodate the guitar security strap has a rubber strap that hold the neck securlycons slight chemical smell that dissipates after a few daysthis is a good value for a very functional and good looking guitar stand highly recommended cfh the gauges are identical to ernie ball regulars yellow label but the d addario s string tension feels stiffer which is nice for slide playing i like my action medium low comfortable for straight playing and bending solid intonation for chords yet not too much fret rattle for slide i usually stretch the heck out of ernie ball s after putting them on because they have so much spring in them i deliberately left the d addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all their new sound is quite bright as advertised but has far less of what i call new string jangle which is fine by me as a kid i d sweat that off in an hour but these days playing a number of instruments it can last awhile there s a string tension chart handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number i ll admit i d never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting but apparently that s the case and d addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set if you do come across fakes if you re willing to report it they ll provide you with a genuine replacement for free i ve used d addario phosphor bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over years and swear by their quality and consistency i ve used ernie ball s on electrics for even longer habits can be tough to break but as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots i find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings finally nailing a sound and feel you ve been chasing after for years makes it all worth it these strings are great with my acoustics however lately i ve been using electric strings instead they work well sound great and i believe they really compliment my playing got this to run instruments into my comp to use with sony acid and this works well i had problems with the sony acid latency boo and while i downloaded an asio program to cut the latency i don t use it really now but is good to have when and if i use the sony for recording and not just mixing the stereo sound on this is great like true guitar stereo i m sick of protools and i wanted to find something cheap and easy until i could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it i m using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick the problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input i ve tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn t external to the unit i even tested the exact same mic cable input into my mbox with protools and got a clean recording i actually like this unit s tone better than the mbox it seems more transparent if not for the hum it would get stars unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem the hum isn t loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise i even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem so it works for rough stuff for your own use but i wouldn t use it for anything you plan on passing around much this was my first foray into home recording and it comes with audacityfor free free is free and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction the interface is noisy and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc sent it back after one day
640	well i don t really know what else to say i ordered them for the guitar though i won t be using them for the banjo i prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo the thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put they feel kind of alien right now as it s the first time i ve ever wore finger picks but i ll get used to them eventually p the picks arrived quickly within a couple days of my order they work well after adjusting them to fit the thumb picks did not work so well for us it was too big for me to get to fit in any way and too small for my friend to use using the string cleaner on a regular basis helps to prolong string life and keeps your guitar sounding bright and full a repeat buy i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it a day doesn t go by where the stand is not in use i now have two of these really wish now i had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase kicks self and all i can say you simply can t beat it i also have a hercules tri stand x more expensive than this one and between the two gotta admit the only major advantage my tri stand has is saving space which actually is a huge consideration for me i honestly don t know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two musician s gear tubular guitar stands i currently own never once have given me an issue aside from bodily running into the thing and they have held do hold a variety guitars of various styles banjos both open back and bg resonator mandolas anything with a long neck all in all unless there is some specialized stand need i would first come to musician s gear if you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track these will not help much that being said these are not junk nor are they cheap nasty instruments there are plenty available that are much worse than these straight from the case these don t bend well but do not despair having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days about eight hours of playing so far i have persuaded the g a bb and c to bend enough to satisfy curiosity but they will not hold up to serious playing i do not destroy my harps easily so am not the most aggressive player out there but i felt like these would certainly be something even i may wear out pretty quickly for the purpose i intended these to perform they are about perfect with me breaking them in i can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics better use these inexpensive harps to over blow and squawk through than the set i will be buying in six months if the promise of musical ability follows through the advantage of the plastic comb is that i don t need to pass on any germs with them they wash very easily with no damage for the price you get seven good harps that make presentable learner instruments with just a little prep without the experienced blues player to break them in it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them there are many youtube videos that will teach the method so try hard persevere and you will crack it with these harps try learning bending on the lower key instruments first they will be easier
641	i agree with all the other reviews these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack unless you make money with your headphones or have money to burn you probably don t need anything better than the m s the only thing i would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans they make the headphones take up less room when folded good for travelling but i m old fashioned and prefer rigid phones they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don t have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation no big deal though comes with nice screw on to adaptor i brought this for my husband drum set he loves it it is made very nice i am happy peter piper picked a pack of purple peppers test passed no puh sound to be found on the recording simple but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case this a great device to put my genuine planet waves signature picks in michael haller captain soul s sound circus they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so this cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect clean sound absolutely love this this is definitely recommendable
642	this box is small but packs a great punch i don t notice any difference in audio or loss in sound the two dials for mic and mon levels are nice and stiff and feel like they will last this personal monitor station is much smaller than i thought it would be which is definitely not a bad thing the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only if you find you just aren t getting enough mic in your headphones grab this asap it was suggested that i start with this product since i m learning and adding it to my repertoire of instruments comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding no strings i ve tried are like this it doesn t have a strong character but work together with your guitar my seagull now sound mellow with brightness also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it what part u dont likeyo u can use eq to wash it a bit awayit is quite good can be quite sibilance prone so beware ehso for the pricehighly recommended in these price ranges stick to known brandslike shure ev at etc then come the newbies a few models from mxl etc etc have fun you can spend a ton more for a studio level multi channel interface but all i wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out x on my bargain basement pc and this fits the bill works perfectly with audacity and windows plug and play enjoyable mic has a decent frequency response range nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise i usually have to do some post processing on vocals but in the genres i work in that s not exactly a rare thing either way sounds way better than i would expect for a mic at this price haven t tried it for drums or guitar yet but i m impressed with it s ability to accurately capture vocals while it doesn t have the warmth that some mics relay i prefer it that way it leaves a really clean if slightly cold flat feeling that can then be warmed up in post production nicely good value for the sound no complaints with the shock mount though make sure to be cautious with your mic placement get a pop filter and if you have a room with lots of ambient noise don t be shocked if it picks some of it up all in all a good deal
643	first of all i use this as more of a band eq using the lower and highest more for lp and hp filters the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders the box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but i tend to set and forget in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that i have been exposed to have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp eq is to enhance your tone not create it a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa your tone is made up of many many variables the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies that is the function of an eq nothing more it can range from dramatic to very subtle very small changes can have large effects small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics i am able to produce i tend to put the eq in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment i am really liking the size of this board i have a line g wireless korg pitchblack xotic ep booster and xotic sp compressor and they all fit very nicely the board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles the case is also really well made good zippers and stitching i d buy this again in a heartbeat if you don t like too much dirt in your tone this might be the pedal for you the sweet baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally if you have a fairly clean single channel amp it won t give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels however if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking step on this pedal and you ll be rewarded if you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp set the gain low and boost it with this pedal the notes ring clear with the extra bite and brightness to cut thru the mix sweet you can use it like a tubescreamer although the sweet baby doesn t color your sound no mid hump i use it to boost my barber direct drive ocd and the dirt channel on my amp the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made it s not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives instead of a tone knob it has a focus knob which controls your picking dynamics and presence all the way to the left the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp all the way to the right when you pick the strings hard it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well you can t get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with this pedal basically takes the sound of your amp adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control i just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob at a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after it s a no brainer they will always sound the same as the very first day i love this strings currently on all my guitars these work great it s hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time you have a strap you have a guitar this locks them together but these do work really well compared to other brands i find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered by me to be aesthetically pleasing but this is true for most strap lock systems so i say go for it if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is you think you are finished with your pedal board but in a few weeks you are back at it searching for another effect but this means trial and error and a busy wallet the solution may be this zoom ms g this unit is like having stompboxes to use on demand without having to change out your board here are some the things i like most about this pedal small footprint same size as most single stompboxes of today the digital effects are very very good most have an almost analog quality to them ability to create and save your own patches ordering them for stage use good tuner included i found it to be very accurate and easy to use if you already have a tuner then you can open up another slot great price considering effects this thing costs no more than a single stompboxthe unit is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it however i will say it takes some work to get a handle on everything and the manual isn t a great deal of help but with just a little work and resolve you ll be dialing in some new sounds i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms g zoom has a reputation of creating quality effects units at very reasonable prices they ve done it again with this pedal i highly recommend it if you have one slot on your pedal board but don t know which pedal should fill it one thing to note that was frustrating at first most of the od s and distortion s are preset with the levels way too high for output to a tube amp once you put these pedals in your own patches you can permanently save them with appropriate levels just be prepared to cut the levels down right away when trying out od s and distortions or you will likely get some very unpleasant feedback i bought this boost to use in one specific situation when playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down my volume drops quite dramatically this boost does what it says it will do to remedy that but it also seems to add a lot of noise when the boost is off my super high gain fryette deliverance is very quiet when i just hold my hand over the strings i m using a lp custom with a stock r pick up in the neck and t in the bridge when i turn on the boost i immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise when playing it isn t so bad but i definitely am not used to so much extra noise there are a couple of adjustment switches inside and i haven t fooled with those yet but i m definitely going to do that this boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound but if you ve already got pro quality stuff i don t see too much of an advantage here i have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviews i already have an mxr line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp this serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run replacing that with the ep booster did not have a significant impact on my tone yes it was a little colored but not too different from the line booster if at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal i didn t find it magical though because i ve always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different i am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos
644	despite the sensitivity of a compressor microphone i still use this to record heavy metal guitar only thing is i use a small amplifier only a fifteen watt line spider i can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar anyways the only thing is when i use recording software i have to not record the guitar too loud and oh my it records good now i no longer have to record straight into my computer where i get all loud over compressed guitar sound i can record with drum loops and with the microphone it goes into the computer and i no longer get the loud over compressed guitar sound that i never like very much glad i purchased this for those who would try this for guitar remember this is a sensitive compressor mic and you will get a very loud recording you will not like so you just record as quietly as you can this mic is sensitive but oh boy i like it man i can play for hours and the guitar goes way better with the drum loops and as i said before the amp is not gonna be loud enough to bother the neighbors a good buy well worth the price now it doesn t work same day i got it in my control panel the mic is there but it doesn t pick up any sound followed all the instructions emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been days no answer maybe i m being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment im starting a podcast i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this great for voice overs in sound proof studios the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise the ability to select the recording modes is great if youll use it i would not reccomend recording people at once on this however recording a choir or something would work but i will never do that and neither will you this microphone only has a usb port not xlr so no hope of expanding if you ever want to host a podcast with people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and new microphones or you can do what i did and get audio technica atr s behringer xenyx dual mic input mixer shock mount broadcast boom combos and windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand now i can replace my mixer and keep my mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for hosts on my podcast do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever i am not a sound guy i just wanted something to plug in and record my practice sessions this is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments the four direction settings are fun though i find myself using the stereo or cardioid settings the most the no delay headphone jack is great i was impressed the first time i plugged everything in and tried it out it s nice to hear how my playing sounds from an outside standpoint setup was easy and quick i have experienced a few times when plugging it in registered it as a recording device but failed to actually use it this may be a windows problem and fixed itself eventually i am quite happy with the build quality the base is hefty and wide planting the mic firmly the body and buttons are plastic but solid they don t feel or look cheap this box is small but packs a great punch i don t notice any difference in audio or loss in sound the two dials for mic and mon levels are nice and stiff and feel like they will last this personal monitor station is much smaller than i thought it would be which is definitely not a bad thing the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only if you find you just aren t getting enough mic in your headphones grab this asap watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the yeti microphone works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises larger than i expected i love it it works great no ambient noise or clicks as some have suggested it s as easy as you plug it in and or flip a switch for the desired effect and voila it works so duh why do i need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject just buy the product and get on with happy music making thank you on stage the mixer arrived early which was a life saver i immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre amps were used for three vocalists and one flute and the cd input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs i am looking forward to using more of the effects i ve tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last years and i ve settled on d addarios for all my guitars their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency the price is right they re color coded to make string changing easier and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more the s are my choice for rock and blues good quality well made its a simple cable what can be said it was a good deal did the job perhaps more than anything else it was the introduction and subsequent success of the zoom h personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi professional level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user friendly equipment at reasonable prices the price of the samson meteor usb mic a fairly recent entry has come down to the point of being fairly valued initially i was seeing it going for prices above the better sounding blue yeti mic it s an attractive some would say cute little mic with its quaint retro design and deceptively fold up portable size i say deceptive because due to the non adjustable mic stand it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop next to a computer and squarely in front of the narrator s mouth bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound it s good but nowhere close to studio quality it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking high fidelity audio to spend the extra for a blue yeti or an audio technica at usb as tempting as the lower price of the non usb version of the at is be sure to try it out with a pre amp supplying phantom power before going that route i ve known a couple of individuals who ordered the at condenser mic only to discover that it was useless with a computer even with the addition of a snake light cable if your primary considerations are convenience and portability the samson go mic sounds almost as good as the meteor and is unmatched in size convenience and portability it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions i m tempted to say it s the perfect laptop mic clipping to the top cover more securely than the snowflake whereas the yeti is ideal for desktop use producing rich sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio s shure sm b mics this is the best usb microphone out for under bucks it s a shame that its been out for a few years now and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording the sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as i have this fairly close to my computer in my office and i can t hear the computer in my recordings i haven t used this microphone with instruments as i am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video and it sounds great the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows i did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone but it worked perfectly after that i just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock mount yeti combo pack as i have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven t used the base that much since arriving at that setup if you are in the market for an excellent usb microphone look no further you can t get anything better than this for under bucks just make sure you get a pop filter for it and yes the blue pop filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn t just check out my review video for the blue pop blue microphones the pop universal pop filter
645	i like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole or for that matter to the headstock where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole it works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound not quite true to your guitar you will note this in particular with a classical guitar this can be balanced to some degree with your amp s equalizer and or the treble and bass settings however compared to the axl pickup which i bought for comparison the cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar i use this one spot adapter with the pedal attachment works perfectly i ve seen reviews about this brand being noisy i suspect this to be happening with the pedal version too many for one simple volt source to handle i ve owned it for a couple of months used it at home days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times zero hum or buzz from the unit i should also mention that i do not have any drive distortion pedals on my board good bottom the stainless give s you a nice treble there s still a good flatwound sound i use roundwound on my other basses but it was nice to come back i have had this pedal for a while and prefer it to my boss dd and the anolog is much more natural sounding its said that its not actually an anolog pedal however i think it does a good job at mimicking anolog sound ive played guitar and bass for over years and had a few decent pedals in that time i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound great pedal good price and sound classic behringer plastic housing i haven t had a problem with ever but i don t dog my stuff favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt that s flexible fair to say real tube is the best but for analog and practice amps this does put some life in the tone can t say for metal as i m not so into but everything else find this fits the bill this is a nice little pedal it effectively quiets all my other pedals works as advertised not much else to say get one noisy as any compressor but after using it i don t wanna go back to not having one for my setup there s not much to be said about this pedal it just works it s my fourth cheapy behringer pedal and i have been pleased with every one of them this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right i play punk blues and country and this pedal helps me obtain the entire range of sounds necessary for my various styles even on a cheap amp upgrading to a marshall next month this gets the job done people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo it s a good solid plastic that holds up well and if it drops the price to instead of that just makes behringer effects more accessible than that other brand behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer it is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting i ve had more expensive pedals over the last years of playing but it s hard to beat the price features and quality of the behringer pedals i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product i have been playing professionaly for more than years and in that time have gone through many amps guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts the great ones i have kept over the years ibanez ts and ts mxr compressor etc and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesn t take up much stage room the one item that i didn t have in a pedal form was a good reverb i have had great success with other behringer rack products digital reverb echo eq s patch panels and other home studio stuff the dr was my first behringer pedal i think it works great i have had it for about months and have used it almost every weekend since i got it to play jobs with my band often several nights a week it has given me no problem i can t speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a one spot multi ac adapter i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic easy to use and very accurate it makes tuning a breeze behringer makes a lot of electronics for guitar and bass i have an fcb that i use and like great controller for the price the cs at roughly is a decent pedal that will get the job done is it equivalent to a boss dynacomp visual sound or keeley compressor nope you will get worth of use out of it though for sure the housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a pita just don t take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point while the case is made of plastic the construction is solid and seems very durable my disappointment is with the sound i never could dial in a sound that made me feel like it enhanced the sound of my bass it was just different i ve switched to using the built in compressor in my digitech bp instead and nice its like really just wow you know like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it
646	was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died useless now i used the line input to tap into an aux feed that got recorded as it came off a live board for the price i guess i shouldn t complain too much behringer often means trading price for longevity as the qc seems to be very hit and miss so now time to decide do i resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta note this is a low end but still pro audio piece of a equipment and while it truley doesn t get super loud for people who say it barely does anything volume wise i have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment if so your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the dbu line level signal that pro gear offers subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with and as a result are getting poor volume plus the added bonus of increased distorion and or floor noise when you do try and crank it up update well it works some days and not others it seems so a i keep it around for now as i am having more good days than bad days with it lately can t really see a rhyme of reason to it connections don t seem loose or intermitant or anything like that i just either have good volume or it craps out it is in one permanent location used exacty the same way every time so it s never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear brass tacks they are velour they fit on the ath m headphones that is what i wanted they are not a perfect fit as they are meant for a slightly larger can but it s more than snug looks good too remember because of the material you will notice a slight difference in sound at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good i don t own the srh s but rather the srh s it was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the s in terms of sound and comfort i didn t believe the sound part but i bought them because i at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my s when i got them they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals they are definitely more comfortable i don t know what it is but something about the sound is different and i don t think it s placebo there seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places i wouldn t expect i highly recommend this upgrade
647	it s tough to shell for a pedal that is not an effect but now that i ve had it for a few weeks i m glad i bought it although my guitars pretty much stay in tune warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while i m playing them the boss tu is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time when you play in a band you got to have a pedal tuner and you can t go wrong with boss this system works great i have a taylor ce and two other guitars i use these on very simple and works great i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic there are tons of settings and the leds are nice and bright for dark stages or bright outdoor venues highly recommended i bought two sets of these for two of my fender x bass cabinets i slipped them right in using the original fender screws since they re machine screws eb comes with wood screws very solid tis pedal really did for me what i wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines i don t mess with the noise gate so i can t really comment on that but everything else is first rate i bought this power supply for in home use i don t do too much gigging or recording so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around the product works very well i m able to power of my pedals easily the cords are plenty long in length however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other i e having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal however that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product i haven t had to use any of the special adapters though but i plan on getting a line dl so having the line adapter is a great added touch best of all all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home i ve been using this product for months now and have no complaints you can t beat the price i use a late s yamaha steel string with this going into an lr baggs para di and it works amazingly well the sound is impeccable but you can t expect to just plug it in and go you ll need a feedback buster and a good preamp but it really does the job good tone i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks obviously they weren t they re as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but it s still not too bad outside of a vintage show bud volume pedal this is possibly the finest volume pedal on the market today very smooth and accurate i like the feel of this unit and the sound is transparent i cannot tell if it is in or out of my signal path i run this volume pedal after my pedal board at this time i have a dirty pedal delay chorus and tuner on the board at this time but i am upgrading to a larger pedal board soon and will place the volume after the dirty pedals and before the delay and chorus pedals at that time the pedal is heavy sturdy thick rubber pad on top nice rubber the bottom that covers the entire underneath of the pedal built like a tank brushed finish connections on the front it is very big i wear an shoe and it fits my foot very well so this is not for a small pedal board there is a tension adjustment on this unit so the end user can dial the feel of the pedal in to his or her liking if you need a volume pedal just buy this one you won t be sorry just as a reference i have used an ernie ball the one with the string and the morley volume pedal this dunlop volume pedal is finer than the other two the fit finish sound feel while using it ease of use and build quality far exceed any other pedal on the market today
648	this works well has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use no adjustments are required for my guitars but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo this capo comes with a pick holder and it is expandable with ad addario ns micro clip on tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm i do not use a pick and i use my own tuners so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs this capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars the other one being theg th performance capo the g capo goes with my takamine new yorker and this planet waves goes on everything else if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo recommended as is the case with all tools you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter it s extremely well built and performs its task very well pros extremely high quality metal comfortable rubber grips red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag of tricks effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringscons has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage the tool is spring loaded to open while this may be a plus for some people i find it less than ideal overall this is an extremely well made tool for your guitar kit if you re a bassist that likes stainless steel strings you ll appreciate how they cut like butter i am extremely pleased with this amp i purchased it because i was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill the numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price even though this is a low wattage amp this sucker can get loud the other reviews detail the exact specs much better than i could so i will defer to them for that however this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone i highly recommend it these really sound great on my acoustic flat top guitars d addario s are the best and i love the ball end color coding no guessing or searching for the vernier caliper to make sure the right string is on the right tuner this coding system is consistent thru all their string sets can t beat this like all gibson products this is high quality polish that one would use on a high quality guitar i have used gibson polishes for years i m an acoustic player but every once in a while i break out the strat just to have some fun and get a little variety i wanted to get some of the cool s fuzz going just to play around and experiment for me this pedal was a great way to do that with electric guitar i m not a tone freak and i don t need everything to sound authentic for me this pedal gets you of the way there it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls if you re comparing this to boss fuzz pedal this one is probaly a lower build quality e g made from plastic but it s also only i m not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage so i ll gladly take the savings
649	and works well for it my only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal i don t know how long it will last i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole but the price is right and the stand is solid enough all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last i ve only used the string winder so far but it works well so far i use it on my guitars and my banjo the other things look like they will work well but i haven t used them yet so i can t say for sure if not then i ll update this review if i can the cable came in the time it was promised it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows computer my music program had no problem detecting it and using it purchased this and a comparable hosa cable this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling i will stick to gls products from this point forward i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john view tips and guidelines headline more words required bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage the mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life i store my picks in there and i put it by my table it s a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done it functions as designed it saves time when restringing a guitar it s made pretty well for a plastic tool definitely takes less space than a wire cutter and a cordless drill to change strings admittedly the cordless drill would be used mostly by luthiers but you get the point
650	after using d addario strings i ve try to ernie ball strings i have ten years ago with ernie ball strings and let me tell you that it s the best strings in comparison with regular slinky this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk clasical rock and indie sound i have an stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house i ve had few handheld units some apps on my phone the korg pitch black some fender thing the boss tu and the tc electronic polytune i can say that the only tuner that i prefer over this one is the pitch black this little ca is actually faster and better than the tu by a hair and absolutely kills the polytune in speed and accuracy korg really knows how to build their tuners and this one is a truly great one works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric and also does a fine job on basses too i don t know if it s accurate enough for a piano but it is what it is cool tuner i have this on my pedal board and it works really well very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isn t on i bought this pedal after looking at the boss tu and korg pitch black for bass this pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode strumming all or strings works well for a quick tune but i still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune the accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low b i read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out tc electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped imo but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselves i was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the ad g strings and it worked okay the pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze i chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as i can i tested this sweep option on an old ibanez artcore guitar which hasn t been played for years and even with old strings i got a reasonable tune out of it strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune i am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old boss tu i feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze i like the pedal it s totally silent very bright display sensitive meter in fact the only complaint i have is that the strum every string at once thing isn t as useful as you might think not that i ever use it i d buy this product again if i had it to do over again wow i m really impressed with this tuner strumming the strings gives you a quick overview of which strings are out of tune and as you tune each string it automatically switches to a chromatic mode it s quick it s accurate and it just works well with this power supply you can offer to your pedals vdc vdc vd or vac i m using pedals conected to this power supply and i don t have any kind of noise or hum i like the tuner and i m definitely keeping it but the polyphonic aspect of it is pretty useless when you tune using the needle or led version of a needle it will show each string as being in tune then when you strum and use the polyphonic mode it often shows some strings are out and that s even when i use the neck pick up and strum with my thumb as the manual says to do but the tuner works great in the single string mode and i also like the drop d setting and the easy way to switch between the modes it also has very cool and easy ways to adjust the hz pitch and it is very easy to switch to eb tunings and other settings i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting that is a very cool feature for those folks who still use batteries to power their pedals the tuner works great and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting so buy it but do it because the price is right and it works great as a tuner in the traditional sense not because of the polyphonic gimmick august edit as follows i just found out a feature of this pedal that i definitely do not like i dislike it so much i had to edit my review i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat so i set the tuner to the e flat setting as explained in the manual then i tried to tune all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning i wrote the manufacturer they did get back to me quickly and they explained that the drop tuning functions only work in polytune mode so if you re like me and you find that polytune doesn t work very well then basically all this is is a standard needle chromatic tuner that will not tune in any other drop modes lame
651	i use this to power a big muff pi mxr compresser ibanez tube screamer and a planet waves tuner pedal the only pedal i have that it won t power is a digitech whammy but that was expected when i bought it it works great i use the volt battery adapter to power the big muff and it even works perfect i get no extra hum with the pedals and it only takes up one spot in my surge protector great little power source i m not sure i d use it for professional gigs but great for home use being a studio owner i didn t buy this for stage work being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades i ve had many different tuners including real strobes so when i picked this up about months ago it was because i needed one where i was at and right now i don t know about the accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it s quite accurate enough that i can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it by using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments i m still using the replacement battery i put in about months ago but i just use it and unplug it s travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from feet and continue working i was shocked by how well it works i was shocked by the fact that i could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close highly recommended i normally tune to drop f on my string but even in standard i just cant stand the strobe and theres no other mode i ordered a pitch black for im still waiting on the return for this i ordered this primarily for my string ovation bass first there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings my ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but i was finally got it on the bottom between the d g string tuners it does not respond well to an open b but octaves are fine and as long as i have confidence in my intonation it is no problem i tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on when i tried it on my ibanz solid body string i found it to be even less likely to read quickly or at all also worked great on my strings it s well made and is fine as straps go but the pick pocket isn t much use the picture implies that it hold the pick so that it s partially exposed and easy to grab however the pocket is bigger that this and fairly loose so that picks tend to fall out when taking the strap off
652	these are nice and sturdy picks they sound real clean i m having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics i have been using this since the day it arrived it was very easy to setup although windows reads the device as a speaker so the usb does not work for me that way it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it i first bought the yamaha mg c mixer but it arrived defective so i returned and bought this instead first impression of profx is very good it s a lot more durable heavy than the mg c and the knobs are constructed much better for example all the knobs that have centering dent on mg c doesn t line up well some are off by a few degrees but on this profx every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm really like the eq on the main output as well as mute on every channel build in fx effects are okay you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anything when using usb to do recording with audacity there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording regardless if microphone channel is turned off or not microphone preamp is so so i guess i have a akg d and sm with both mics i have to turn gain and channel volume to to get a decent output but it does the function perfectly runs a little bit on the hot side power cable is kinda short so you may want to look for a longer one i could not be happier excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful buy it by now you have probably read about the problem with the usb connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the usb functionality unusable an amazon reviewer referred to this as a fatal flaw and i heartily agree i experienced this firsthand then read folks struggling with the issue on the mackie support blogs when i called mackie support to seek a fix i was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware they sent me a new mackie board from the newer lots and i returned my old one i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since i am thankful to mackie for the great customer service especially since i addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired i m assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem but if it does contact mackie to get a replacement at this point i am still running the board through its paces but thus far so good
653	i am in agreement with others that state this is a must have i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard this really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood i ve used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard i rub the entire neck down before and after i play it makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop which i suspect is what they must ve been using all these years and never told me though i never did ask foolish me since i ve recently gotten into doing my own setups where i ve read many forums and posters have recommended this and i figured what the heck it s less than in a world of round wound strings flat wounds the original bass starings aren t as popular these are nice and bright love em the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing sent it back and did not reorder in my opinion d addario is the standard by which all other strings are measured i keep trying different brands from the cheap to the boutique and i always keep coming back to d addario extremely versatile stable and they last as long as can be reasonably expected of any non coated string
654	i play guitar and stand behind the vocalists if this does not bring their voices back to me i can t hear especially on some of the female solo pieces it is big help be better if we could eliminate the buzz it causes in the church s sound system after online research i decided to buy and found locally this midi pad to use in reason although not confirmed online as working with reason i was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems my cpu is windows but it worked on my msi netbook also this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online i would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs if your a musician or want to be recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well i have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said you cannot beat a tascam recorder for ease of operation features and sound quality enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack so much more efficient than a floor monitor i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips and because there is more than one channel i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics definitely recommend hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space i bought this unit for my son s edrums and because of the inputs rca mic instruments i plugged my guitar in channel mic in his edrums on rca and we re good to go not as loud as the or speakers of course but for small room this will do playing music on rca channel is also nice but you will need to adjust the eq to get a good highs and lows light weight and very portable i play nights a week in a midi assisted duo our pa is a pair of mackie thumps powered on the floor and behringer b d powered on stands with a mackie board we adjust the pa to the room by adding or reducing the number of powered speakers in larger rooms we have a regular pair of floor monitors but in smaller rooms where you are stuck in a corner between the coat rack and the waiters station you know the spot where they generously removed two small tables we don t have space for floor monitors these smaller jobs have become much more common and i needed a compact yet powerful monitor since we work with midi sound modules to reproduce the drums bass and assorted extra instuments it is very important that we hear these sounds clearly the behringer monitors do the job well the overall sound is clean and clear the speakers are light and portable and for me the boom stand adapter works well i compared the behringers to their clone the mackie srm and frankly i couldn t hear a major difference with my mp player playing through them obviously behringer cloned the mackie s and did a good job they have all of the same inputs and outputs as the mackie s and look almost exactly the same i have owned a pair of behringer b d powered speakers for about three years now and they have been knocked over and mistreated accidentally and still work great every night so i am a fan of behringer gear in the end the real difference was the price the behringer s go for while the mackie s go for about the choice was simple since i couldn t hear or see a major difference i bought the behringer s i have only had them for about two months but i have been pleased so far update it has been a couple of months more since i started using these monitors and have even purchased an additional one i still love the sound and all of the other things i posted above but forget about the boom stand adapter it is very difficult to get lined up so the mic is facing you and because of the angle of the monitor itself which is not adjustable the boom will not stay in place i am using a good quality telescoping mini boom that is not very big or heavy at all but it will not stay up save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand other than that these are great monitors use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon t leave home without itbut take and extra button battery
655	these are made solid and are very stable i knocked it to stars because they don t match up the holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky i bought a set of these from amazon s warehouse deals page with a discount because of some expected damage they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise i was expecting some damage to the items but hoping that between the of them that i would be able to salvage enough to put together one full stand i bought these because i needed only stand with good height on it for mounting my lcd hitachi flat screen to it i use this tv in my studio so that everyone can see what s going on when we record and work on music i needed something that was going to be sturdy and hold the tv high enough that everyone in the studio would be able to see it all the time both stands showed up in good and working condition they go up to about tall and are perfect for mounting speakers onto although i use it to mount my tv about ceiling height which is about the same weight as my speakers if not more they work great i m going to add some pictures of my creation when i get around to it give me about a month bought two sets both arrived together and at the expected delivery date i had bought two sets of the pyle pro pmdk months previously which also included a pair of ft cabling from an amazon dealer which arrived without problems initially i noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk later comparison showed that the pstk is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker pole however the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing why i blame the manufacturer s packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and side by side within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton no other fore thought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded really how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foam on the plus side after testing each of the tripod stands all seemed to function perfectly well the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy only time and after some use hereafter will i be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain my band had no pa or mics or anything while i admit these are not the quality a band will work up to they fill up the stands at an affordable price not much distance you have to eat the mics but the sound is great full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound this is a great place to begin both of the stands had parts that had fallen out or were missing all together when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects this is a major concern it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control but it does make me suspicious of pyle products these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems they re functional durable and can be set up within just a few seconds i would have given this a higher rating however upon receipt one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight i had set the tension while inspecting the bag i found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand further inspection confirmed this as this block was indeed part of the tube and after several minutes of wrestling with it i was able to get it lodged back inside the block was part of the tension mechanism and once it was forced back into the tube the stand s performed flawlessly
656	it s a great strap it s comfortable and you can wear it for hours it looks good as while i got it earlier then expected and i love it i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro yes a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior easy to install strap locks use on blue strat and looks great enjoy i ordered this product on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday came very well packaged and with all the pieces i was very easy to assembly and looks great for the price you really can t go wrong with this guitar stand works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won t fall off padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected great stand for the price great pedal very lush and usable tones think lightning crashes by the band live ok i was going to initially give it stars because of the following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does not click very miniscule volume drop with engagement actually i moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and i think that resolved the volume issue but i can t tell i guess if it is too close to tell then it s a non issue then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again metal enclosure works like a charm twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping it gets stars because there is nothing even close at this price this is a very secure and almost comfortable there should be a pick pocket on both ends but it is a nice feature unquestionably a top of the line manual string winder but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar s headstock on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy for now i ll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb its a little stiff and i m sure it will soften up upon more use cant beat the price i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long when you need a no nonsense leather strap that is not long consider this if you need something fancy or want to sling your guitar low or if you are a tall person probably you want to skip this i m ft and i m already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin and it s not like i m trying to hold my guitar particularly low if you are a tall person or if you want to mimic jimmy page s posture or something this is not for you apart from that i have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive it s more so if i believe the made in canada sticker on it hard to beat it as far as leather straps go at inches wide it s comfortable one ply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough and the looks of it is not that bad either sure there should be nicer better product but you cannot buy them for bucks the only complaint i have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some elbow grease it would have been nice if i was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar great pedall for the money it makes ur pedalls real quaiet it does what its soupose to german mind great electronics well made but plastic works great as a stand for the elec guitar work good in corners and i like it for starting out learning i thought i would not have a problem with the length of the strap but low and behold it was just a little too short i like my guitar hanging low and this strap doesn t cut it in that department still for the price i had to give it four stars you get a lot of high quality leather at a very good price just wish it went a little longer adjustments are easy to make and the fit feel is fine no fancy designs but a great value for the price despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box this is a high quality gig bag with plenty of storage space fits either a tele or strat i don t typically keep my guitars in their cases but bags like this one come in handy for gigs short trips moves etc nice styling touches too the bag has removable back straps for carrying ease
657	very good tray to put small items i put my kvm switch on it and other server components i recommend it these martin strings m aren t bad they just are not the sound i was looking for i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead the martin s are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball other people will love them though they are easy to play i have a don pablo cuban guitar made in for a few months never change the strings and sounds great i put this strings and wao know sounds wonderful few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change try this are the best i ll start off by saying that i ve had this interface for about months now and it is still going strong i think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit not only does it provide channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out this could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio however i have a few gripes with the i the headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls imo the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aesthetics why stars the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it anyways shortly after i engaged the v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away i hope that this issue does not show up in all of the scarlett i interfaces i would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios hopefully just my unit is defective and it isn t something that is common among the i s another thing to note is that while direct monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use in other words i am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though so in the end stars the packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that i really like the build quality of the interface and focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit the only issue that i would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged overall great entry level interface sound card i bought pack of this and i m still using one so far and is still good nice quality and good price too first of all this strap looks super cool the hootenany style is sweeeet i have this on a cream colored strat like guitar and it looks great the reason for only four stars is that the material is a bit thin but hey for this price i am not expecting a levy s strap all in all this is a great guitar strap throw some strap locks on it and away you go i had put these on and my wife picked my guitar to play and she was confused they do take some time getting used to they don t rip up your hand as much and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift there is less friction this is good but it takes some getting used to i used that finger tip friction to let me know where i was on the fretboard with these i found myself over shifting both high and low i like them and they sound nice but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes i thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it s a nice little portable amp of course you can t drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive it s very thin all parts about it are kinda thin and cheap but it works exactly as it should not bad if you just need to round out an order to get free shipping not for your favorite guitar though more of a beginner s or a throw away gig strap i ve been using a very cheap amp for too long and decided to try a tube amp this thing gave me chills the first time i played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after i unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first you wasted our money on this which turned to dang this thing sounds good guess it s ok with me as i begin to shred on it with my p equipped les paul the tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic and for watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue though i don t think it is loud enough for a drummer it has line out and speaker out which is great and this amp has nice build quality plus it s on sale right now so snatch one before they re all gone i would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device note that this thing takes about seconds to warm up so you can t just flip it on and play instantly not a huge deal just turn it on before you get situated i wish they could have crammed a inch speaker in it though the inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient so stop thinking about it and just go buy it depending on the amp and guitar you have this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer it sounds terrific with my fender strat single coil danelectro lipstick pickups on my solid state amps giving them a warm tube like overdrive it sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp it really sounds aweful with my s kramer loaded with humbucker pickups you ll either love it or hate it that will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use it s a different pedal with every combination this strap is pretty thin not like some of the other for the same price that i have purchased on amazon still does its job but we ll see how the quality is after a while the strap looks great very cool design and looks good on my tele and all for bucks w prime shipping so why only stars this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves i have grown to love planet waves straps for their comfort and durability and obviously the designs i thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design mainly because at my local music shops i have never seen felt a planet waves strap that was not made out of their usual thick soft and durable material whatever that might be that i have grown to love this strap is very thin and brittle feeling which makes it very uncomfortable to use this strap does slide easily on your shirt which is what i prefer but once it makes contact with your neck it is sharp and it makes your neck sore and itchy needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on ouch i have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up that is if it lasts that long overall what you need to know is that this strap is not the same as the other planet waves straps the material is very thin and brittle feeling unlike the many other straps from planet waves if comfort is not important to you then get this strap the price can t be beat and will give your guitar that s look if i would have paid on this strap i would be furious but at only this strap is still a steal this strap has a fantastic old school look and vibe and i ve never had it slip off while playing the only downside is that it s a bit rough on any loose skin i could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up i can feel it on my neck but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t shirt for of situations these strap rocks
658	every issue i had was ironed out by mackie support they are seriously fabulous i m using this for a simple weigh station between my daw and my tascam track so far no problems at all this strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily i plan on using strap locks so it won t matter to me but if you don t use strap locks your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole day my advice install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment then choose comfortable straps that won t scratch your guitar like this one this guitar strap was so inexpensive compared to the other ones i was concerned that it would be flimsy and look terrible since i planned on using it as a mandolin strap i figured it would be alright if it wasn t strong enough for a guitar i was pleasantly surprised to find it well made with a clean simple appearance i am getting another one for my acoustic guitar and may replace the leather strap on my electric guitar with one of these also i picked up a couple of these straps one for a les paul and one for a bass anyone who s ever played a les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a must have this one fits the bill the end pieces are thick with a peg hole that just fits not so small you have to cut and not so large you re worried about the guitar slipping out the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable it doesn t scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesn t grab your shirt so badly can t complain good strap at a good price looking for a strap that is sturdy comfortable and simple in design i use this strap along with and without the planet waves quick release system perfect for use when i am standing and playing i have several for our electrics and acoustics please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help as good as advertized rugged and sturdy live up to expectations and is comfortable i would definitely buy a few more of these
659	being a studio owner i didn t buy this for stage work being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades i ve had many different tuners including real strobes so when i picked this up about months ago it was because i needed one where i was at and right now i don t know about the accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it s quite accurate enough that i can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it by using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments i m still using the replacement battery i put in about months ago but i just use it and unplug it s travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from feet and continue working i was shocked by how well it works i was shocked by the fact that i could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close highly recommended while not as soft and supple as suede straps i am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing it is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker all in all it s a good strap for the money which wasn t much i like using these strap ties far more than i do tying a strap to the neck they are a great idea i found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap but eventually got it on i have two of these and i use them i d definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn t like tying on their guitar straps behringer us ultra harmonist shifter pedal is pretty good you need a little time to learn then it will rock you just try it nice strap i meant its just a basic strap so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far should last a while with good care bought two for a shockingly low price that i couldn t beat anywhere even at double the price quality cable sturdy user serviceable connectors well constructed and months of daily use with no issues what more can you ask for i love these strings been using them forever and via amazon subscribe and save i get them for a really good price i can t really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings it sounds really good on my classical guitar will buy it again in the future i have always been a thin or medium style pick person but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage i was quite surprised at how well it worked i have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it another great roland product really easy to use and well built very good sound great for practice certainly do not get the rc get this rc model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later i did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big check for sales or demos this is a very good general purpose strap a little stiff but i m hoping it will loosen up with use this is a great tuner high quality construction the tuning is accurate the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing waited two months before reviewing my les paul to make sure there were no issues i am very happy with the guitar it came well padded and was in excellent shape it was set up well and has played well out of the box just did my first string change making sure i used the same gauge of string and didn t have to make any adjustments to the guitar played as well after the change as it did before was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it s a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play free prime two day shipping no sales tax and saved about in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store the savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new mustang v amplifier the only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box this one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer it is not a big deal to me but i thought i d mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone when i ordered this one i wasn t really sure if a cable would be included or not so i ordered one at the same time i m glad i did most better quality leather guitar straps are typically or more so in retrospect the low cost of this planet waves black leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag i bought it anyway hoping that it would be a decent product but unfortunately upon receiving it i was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the item while the strap appears to be leather and isn t a piece of junk it doesn t appear to be of very high quality the leather is thin and soft and i would not be at all surprised if the edges soon begin to curl and the strap begins to wrinkle i don t expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts to hold up well long term if you use this strap you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges while the leather has developed some cracks it is still holding up fine and there is no chance that the strap will tear i could be wrong but looking at the planet waves strap i have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long if you are a casual player this strap is probably fine although strap locks are recommended the leather may start to curl up and deform but the strap certainly isn t going to fail immediately while serviceable more serious players or those with an aggressive style of playing might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap i decided to keep this strap but it is installed on a secondary guitar that i don t play that much
660	great microphone at a very good rice the only solid white leather strap i could find that didn t have any ornamentation it is of average quality but for the price i wasn t expecting much it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg xx nice little device we ll see how long it lasts a cheap little plastic thing really but so far it does the job and holds about or so medium picks easily without issue i use it with the medium dunlop picks glad i got it this was a filler item for a much larger order i am very interested in the straplocks so i decided to give them a try i sincerely like the concept you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this what a pain oh well it was cheap enough to have around if you have the full folding single stand this works quite well but the ones with the rounded neck that is one piece with no hinge are a bit tight for length ok quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic i don t understand how people can spend thousands or even hundreds on a guitar and then buy an dollar stand only to see their guitar fall over or get damaged at the neck if you pay attention to the prices you can really get some great deals on amazon untouchable deals the material used is fine the looks are fine the length is horrible this is too short for most adults that play guitar it felt like i was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders i attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what i could use to me this was a worthless purchase i just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again
661	these are well made good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own will purchase again enjoy the only solid white leather strap i could find that didn t have any ornamentation it is of average quality but for the price i wasn t expecting much it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg xx by recommendation from the acoustic tech people i purchased this for my acoustic b unfortunately it was the wong switch but it has true fender quality well built heavy duty construction the switches are rock solid this switch can withstand some heavy quick switch action rubber no skid bottom is a plus i kept the switch because of the quality i know it will come in handy sooner or later nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right now it is a single strip of leather with no padding maybe it just needs to be broken in compliments the color on my lake placid blue strat well for the record this strap is actually quite long even in the second strap hole i am about and a trim lbs at the shortest setting i can manage the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when i am sitting update jul the strap is still rather stiff i will probably pick up a white cotton strap those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently in my opinion very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue adhesive during installation you want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar i m sure this isn t the best echo pedal or even in the top but it serves it s purpose fairly well stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn t something that most of us can t live with for us it s worth taking the risk imhoupdate the pedal gave up the ghost died in a relatively short amount of time i replaced it with mini modtone type delay i actually like the dano sound better but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better i don t travel often with my guitars but needed good protection for those times when i do this product meets all my expectations my les paul and fat strat both fit well in the case it provides good support and cushioning with a roomy accessories compartment the corners of the case are well reinforced the hardware is mid grade i believe it will hold up well for my use and for someone playing weekend gigs overall it is a bargain for the price i don t know if from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body i know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adult however for its on sale at the time even if its not i can still learn to play since thats why i bought it is to learn the pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn t really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine all togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good i am happy with it good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have comes with whammy bar thats what i know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your amp edit so now that amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that i have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit i have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
662	it s well made not much else you can say about it buy it it is worth it packaged very well sure it s a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it built like a tank but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables they haven t had a huge amount of use but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise and i ve bought over of them i got a few of these as a christmas gift and they re just bad i put them on my pedalboard where i previously had longer cables and these just didn t stay in the jack i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these if i play loudly and my room vibrates a bit the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal awful this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only and it s built tough like a good effects pedal should be full metal case and solid construction an all around great buy i use several behringer components in my set up e g my mixer pa speakers effects accessories etc including this pedal i have confidence in the behringer name and always feel like i m getting a good solid piece of equipment that i can rely on this pedal is no exception it s a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal i don t like to depend on battery power for any critical components if i don t have to so i also purchased the behringer psu sb power supply general purpose dc v power adaptor available on amazon along with this great price sturdily built great compressor effect i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible my complaint like other reviews i read is that the end doesn t seem to fit snug on some connections for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal the boss pedals however were hit or miss can t say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose anyway for the money i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable just picked up the korg pitch black from guitar center yesterday i use a snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise love the thing so far its accurate fast fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price i like the multiple display options and calibrations mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe great buy i am happy with it i got it in red
663	i keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost what more could you want i needed a new strap but i didn t want to pay for one i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot i m glad i did the strap is awesome it s very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i ve ever had it totally deserves stars this is an amazing amp it works great a lot of power a little bit heavy for it s size but it is simply a beauty i play a godin a ultra and the the sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect even the acoustic sound is majestic this amp adapts to any need you have from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey first the material that the neck rests in is very soft overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar won t fall off of that skimpy little legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this planet i did find it to be a little short to support my ovation acoustic bass but a small length of x fixed that second it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which i need to get into the back guts side of my ovation wow does this stick or what i installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this power grip mounting tape on the top and bottom of the pedal hof reverb and one afternoon i stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn t budge had i known this before i would have installed all my pedals with this power grip wonder need sticking power this tape will definitely fill the requirement i ve never had a problem with these patch cables i m running pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out one thing that is important to note is that i m not hard on my gear i m a home noodler so i can t say if these patches can take road stage abuse and lots of setup tear down cycles they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what i ve experienced to me there s not too much depth you can go into when describing guitar picks either they feel good in your hand or they don t either they kind of disappear when you re playing or they feel like a hindrance these dunlops get it just right enough grip to where you re not fumbling all over the place and they somehow get out of the way of your playing they re right up there with the fender classic picks as my all time favorites to use this is just another cable out there there is nothing special in particular about it it does what it should cheers they feel great last longer than any other string i ever used and most importantly they sound terrific the medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges my taylor is much louder now that i use these however you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light you can t go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick they have a better grip and a more full sound to my ears over the tortex picks i have since went to the jazz picks but these picks are a solid product this jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required a ft cable is too long i would not depend on it for night after night abuse but it just may last longer than i think planet waves does make good products
664	i used this on my bass which up until recently i was trying to tune by ear i had it close but it s the fine tuning that really helps this tuner really opened my eyes to how much even being a little bit off can change the sound i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one but the tuner was a snap to figure out and i had my bass tuned in less than a half hour i love these cables i ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs they are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day a very handy item great for sitting by your practice amp when you don t want to be bothered with stepping all over your footers the wire could be a little heavier but you can t beat the value the plugs are the standard screw down type with well soldered joints i ve used this now for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord a great instrument mic using it on bass cabinet instead of a line out for that real live hit and the es is equal to the shure sm at less the reason i stopped using amp stands was because i couldn t find anything collapsible and non bulky it works very well and is very sturdy i use it for a hot rod deluxe
665	this is my first tube amp and after doing a ton of research i found that the vox ac c was just about perfect for me it came down to the ac fender blues jr and the ibanez ts the blues jr has a somewhat small enclosure for a x and i felt it had a bit of a boxy tone otherwise it s a great amp the ibanez has a classic tube screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes but it lacked a reverb circuit which was a deal breaker silly reasoning i know the ac has a larger enclosure than the blues jr and it has a reverb and tremolo circuit so it had the features i was looking for and most importantly it produces some killer tone if you ve ever seen or read a review of this amp chances are you ve heard about the classic vox chime which this amp has but i fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away the normal channel will break up nicely too but i would suggest an a b switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty i was worried at first that watts wouldn t be enough but fear not this amp is loud maybe too loud as i m just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom but that s not a bad thing it totally blows away my watt marshall solid state and i haven t put the volume much past o clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if i do while there is no effects loop it takes pedals well but for distorted tones i ve found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch which i ve come to love so much as stated above the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp or as previously stated running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an a b switch to go between them as far as other effects i really like what it does to my tc electronic flashback delay and corona chorus note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel but it controls the on off for the built in tremolo and reverb but it s sadly not included with the amp for my first tube amp i don t think i could have done much better i love the tone that i can get the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp it s feature rich and takes pedals well the other two amps that i was considering were a little less expensive and while i really feel that the vox is just a better all around amp i don t think you can go wrong with any one of the three the weight about lbs and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that i can think of while i would have picked up all three of the amps that i was looking at if i had the means i would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp this thing rocks best quality than polytune lighter and best switch brighter screen simply the best for fast tuning it s sturdy well made and cheap you couldn t go out and buy the raw material and put something like this together for what you pay for it i ve used it with a couple of amps and it ll handle up to say an ac without an issues i have two delay pedals both inexpensive this one and a behringer and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap behringer the danelectro sounds more natural the behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal which is perfectly ok for some applications the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos the case is plastic but unless you eat times your weight at the golden corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet you re not going to break it the only thing i don t like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it i suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the retro look of this pedal ok fine i ve heard pedals costing twice as much that don t sound as nice as this one as one reviewer once wrote there are guitarists who would rather catch aids than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board i however think some of these cheap pedals function quite well and in some cases just as well as their more expensive counterparts if you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your holy grail ocd and other boutique pedals i promise the other ones won t catch aids from this in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
666	this is a very high quality strap the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship however i don t like the plastic end pieces they are large and well plastic so i m sending it back i m going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapprotec guitar strap with leather ends and pick pocket blackand straplocksschaller security locks nickelfor about the same price this is mainly a matter of personal preference if you don t mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap i m not a performing musician so i actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand holds everything from a mm nylon pick to a mm rubber pick and i have yet to see one fall out simple solution to a simple problem i have an axe fx that requires quality monitoring i do use studio monitors but sometimes i need something that no one else can hear and for a while was using the senheiser hd pro headphones when i put these on without burning them in i was blown away at the difference for more these cans are more than worth the extra cashalso better is the leather wrapped around the arc much sturdier while the pad on my senheisers is flaking off piece by piece
667	wow does this stick or what i installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this power grip mounting tape on the top and bottom of the pedal hof reverb and one afternoon i stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn t budge had i known this before i would have installed all my pedals with this power grip wonder need sticking power this tape will definitely fill the requirement so glad i found these three sides much easier for me to hold thin is in as a beginner these make much more comfortable planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product it s soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat recommend it old tech bungee type of capo inexpensive and works well you have to remember that banjos don t have a lot of tension on the neck to they really don t require a vice to get the job done works well on mandolin s too nice cushion on both sides on string and the back of the arm stays very firm on the arm it ll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing the star is just to alert that it may be a problem for people with not so strong hands like kids as the spring is very tough i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness no mud clear mids and highs with clashing mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now love it
668	use them for home recording nothing on the road for that purpose these are made well wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly i just picked up a pod hd and i love it of course a couple days later they announced the hd x but it doesn t look like they ve made any major changes anyway if you re thinking of getting one here are my thoughts in no particular order this thing is versatile you can use it in a number of different ways just as an effects board with customized effects with effects and amp sims as a midi controller and as a recording interface to name a few line gave you access to the guts everything is tweakable assignable and flexible they trust their users to read the freaking manual i m amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay no problemo for live performance this thing would be perfect it allows you to organize your presets in set lists and name everything whatever you want you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves while not all the effects are my cup of tea in particular some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear there are enough options to make anyone happy for example i love the distortion i get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects fantastic it s built like a tank metal exterior everything feels solid and like it will last longer than i willif you ve got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance take a look at these and the new x version just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates not to mention the amps would cost you more money assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones truly a great piece of gear i m no audiophile but this thing is just as good as my bbe green screamer it s perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up i would give this stars for the way it works but a page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much something simpler would suffice really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it if you don t mind spending the time to learn all it s capabilities it s great sing that in a drivin and cryin s alt rock way why cause that s what this bad boy or girl to be pc does it is instant ideas the thing that makes this so simple and effective is you can simply record a riff or melody top part then create around it loop by loop or just one idea with another on top as simple as this sounds otherwise you would have to record a track then play over that taking time and killing inspiration in the process there are others on the market to be sure i had the boss looper with pedals and it was noisy on playback that was years ago and i couldn t get rid of it fast enough i ve used delay pedals my whole life and being a fan of shoegaze dream pop i have always had a love of layered guitars loops a la the church or the chameleons or chapterhouse lush house of love and stuff i looked on youtube and read reviews for a while before my purchase as i don t have money to waste this seemed to be the best choice for me the use of this live especially without the footswitch sold seperately would be tough to be sure there are some stop and start moments as to be the case with loopers the only one i ve seen that seems seamless is the boss one or roland one with like pedals and is like bucks maybe more there are demos of a guy looping himself with different instruments all running into it for the price it should be and is great this little wonder though is fantastic the price can t be beat and it doesn t suck up tone as some of the other ones do from what i ve read the thing i would say is it s best for recording and to use as an audio notepad in a way you can use saved loops in songs but since they are already formed so it s silly to start a song with guitars in a dense dance my last thought on this this is a secret come closer closer now come on i won t bite a volume pedal that way you can layer with different adjusted levels and not bending down and fixing levels and such sounds simple but you ll see i am going to look for a decent one this is a great pedal i bought the extra footswitch to go with it it makes it alot easier to operate does all i need it to do wish it were stereo stores loops doubt i d ever in my lifetime need that many i haven t tried the computer interface yet this gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the more me setting it s simple easy to use works great very fun to use comes with a power supply very easy to control i enjoy using this to play alone it is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it it can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat i was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my fostex mr recorder and did a little research on the xenyx just looking at it with it s inputs number of controls i would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks imagine my surprise when after reading the positive reviews that i discovered this thing was only i bought it immediately and right out of the box it did exactly everything i was expecting it to this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the fostex i m quite excited about my future recordings using the i m like a kid with a new toy highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case i ve posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page the right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp i use a mogami silent cable mogami platinum guitar straight to straight with quiet plug feet for the input to my guitar but i can t justify paying a lot more money for the side that goes to my amp it s not getting bumped around plugged and unplugged etc this cable works perfect for it s purpose oh yeah and it matches my tweed amp
669	this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles he was very happy with his gift what s not to like beatles picks a super cool little tin rocks my world and back to the garden i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand i had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over this one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over small and sturdy i use it at practice and during our live shows you can t go wrong with this i love this capo better than any i have seen or used great quality and price you wont go wrong with this capo practical useful for drum kit tilts to match personal requirement fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances prof mike haller i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable i was surprised at how cool both the tin and the picks were they are a real talking point and a must have for muso s who like individual items in their collection thanks again cheers i cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp i was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound instead i couldn t put it away i must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe the tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing i would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp the v battery holds up well which is surprising considering the drive you got off it so spend the and get something that is a real deal i hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one
670	so heres the thing that no one else wants to say the thing is built like a piece of s it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around i used this times and it shorted out the lights started flashing and it got hot i called line and they determined it was bad so they opened a ticket fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon well see how helpful they really are i have always loved line this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up it went dead i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead i am sorry to say that i returned it my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs i am really disappointed like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa i also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to mark everything that comes into contact with the floor so needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my dean from hell i had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar hoping that they would all arrive at the same time so i was unaware at how heavy the dean was this one looked sturdy enough and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweight hollowbody electric but the fact that i had to bend out the pegs just a smidge so the end knobs won t chew up the neck when trying to access store the guitar had me doubting the longterm durability of this product don t need to come home months from now find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules once i get the hercules i ll be using this mount for my rock band guitar controller i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay it is out there for to no buzzing and crackling and no more wires no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless the relay g has perfect frequency response because it is in the ghz band like a wireless wifi router or cordless phone all the soft clipping is there for every nuance in fact i don t hear any interference at all even with a single coil some feedback is good but not that screaming feedback loop from cables missing their grounds i play directly into a line pod and can piggy back wah pedals and other effects with the relay g on front it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable this is a professional wireless system best purchase i ve made this year you won t be disappointed it is worth the price
671	after trying about every comp out there for years i came across this i have a wampler ego compressor too it is the same quality as the ego compressor better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me let s get a few things straight from the start i love effects pedals i love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal and have owned a few and i ll also play the mass produced boss and ibanez stuff and if you put foreign no name brand in front of me but the pedal is made well and sounds good i ll play that too all you need to know is that this pedal is well constructed and sounds darn good for dollars joyo is a chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor a heavy duty metal box with an mxr like button switcher and then clones mimics copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from to and they ve figured out how to ship them to the u s and sell them for to each i ve recently discovered these pedals and if money pedalboard space were no issue there s probably to of them i d like to own the star of the joyo lineup however is arguably the jf ultimate drive this pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an american company bought them in bulk repainted them and tried to sell them for almost the fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the quality the pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the fulltone ocd overdrive a boutique pedal that came out several years ago and usually sells from around i own that pedal and i ve done a side by side comparison on my pedal board and while tone is extremely subjective i m not sure that i wouldn t go with the joyo ultimate drive in a blind test while the knob lo hi switch are clearly inspired by the fulltone ocd the pedals actually sound quite different with the exact same settings the fulltone will actually sound much brighter that s really saying something because the fulltone is known as having a very well rounded tone with a defined base well the ultimate drive offers even more bass and mids yet the tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom end it s actually extremely versatile i m not sure that it would do low gain crunch sounds very well but if that s what you want consider the joyo vintage overdrive the joyo crunch distortion or a tubescreamer right now i have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great overdriven marshall tone the fulltone the ultimate drive and the marshall gv guv nor while they are all great pedals the joyo really hits the sweet spot on my vox combo amp using a gibson les paul as for soloing lead play i m noticing all types of pick attack harmonic response with the joyo that i don t get with other stompboxes it really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel if you point all the knobs at o clock some people may think it is muddy but that tone knob really does change the character quite a bit sorry for the long rant but i want people to know that just because you can t afford on a single pedal doesn t mean you can t enjoy a great overdrive stomp box check the jf out it just might be your gateway drug to other joyo pedals
672	my experience with this little tuner has been perfect it s extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment it s dead quiet when activated easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you re tuning takes up very little room on a pedal board the cream on the coffee is that it s under a hundred bucks that s crazy for the build quality it s a little iron bricki highly recommend this little guy korg got it right on this one i ve had many mic holders and this one is by far the very best it does it all and is tougher than nails sincerely doc it s an excellent pedal well designed perfect size incredible quality if you are looking for a u delay s stile it is perfect for you first real harmonica i have owned read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many the price is right and the quality seems good too didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single double blow draw still trying to get the overblow i am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on it has a good seal also only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy this is a super easy to use pedal you just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset don t worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound if you really want to be able to tweak everything then get the mxr analog chorus instead it has about six knobs i like the ease of use on this one and i omly use chorus sparingly another cool feature of mxr pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived just to find out it wasn t working it is defective and because i brought it to mexico now i can t get a refund or a replacement i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something very dissapointing its affordable and it works its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input
673	this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff and that my friends is the problem i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo i know i know did i mention this sucker is big i feel like they should name it the pedal porch maybe i can put a few potted plants on it so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds then by all means knock yourself out just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space no joke it works ok if you are used to using a volume pedal i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing i decided to return it it is well made so if you like volume pedals it s probably one of the best i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal it has a mimimum volume knob which allows more subtle changes between rhythm and lead volumes the dunlop does not have that feature i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it on the plus side it is quiet sturdy has a reasonable footprint does not suck tone and it is passive but the feel was not quite right for me even with the adjustable tension i couldn t lock it in to where i wanted it i m very used to the ernie ball pedals and i also like the new morley volume plus but to be fair pedal tension is a pretty personal factor and this might easily be a star product for you what a nice product rugged and well made the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs i was able to build a pedal board with a tuner delay distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare it looks very neat and tidy using george l s makes it look even better i will buy one of these again these things rock edit still a great little board but i found power grip pedal board velcro this board that the new velcro make this an unstopable unit
674	very comfortable lightweight strong good stitching leather ends and adjustable for short or tall affordable and comes in many colors al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto y con una buen duravilidad hoy lo instalare saludos desde venezuela i ve probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life and find that planet waves makes a good one at a fair price picks will always be a subjective thing every user has his her own preference so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end these are well made last quite awhile and they don t even look bad try them out you might just like them just good ol genuine fender parts nothing to complain about here i m a stickler for the oem parts so i typically by only fender stuff i could never get the sound i wanted using other manufacturers strings i tried ernie ball slinkys just for shiggles i was quite surprised at the quality of the tone i get from my guitars now there is a rich toney presence to these springs the cheapest and most effective upgrade you can make on your axe is ernie ball strings hands down the best love this stuff i have been using it for years and it always does the job well cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine
675	this is an a pedalit s small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly the mxr micro flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesif you want a flanger to do any more than that you re just goofing off mostly i need a subtle wash for flanger work and the mxr micro is perfect for that this is super warm and can get very trippy i like the depth it adds to everything from subtle extreme and whatever else the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too nice extra milliseconds really is more than enough and i have a highend tape type unit that is something like seconds but for what this does more than enough i like retro and this is it i used this on a show the day i got it and it was noticed by all i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal again do your youtube homework and listen around and you ll come to your conclusion amazon is great to deal with i started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck i found that i needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the g th both are very good i did notice that if i had a wider neck i think i am mm at the nut on my two takamines the may be a bit short they work and are cool looking i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great cheaper ones also work
676	i purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar this fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my jackson dk i m using springs right know and stay s in tune no matter the abuse the only con on this product is that they are noisy is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing one of the my favorite thigns about strats is how easy they are to modify customize after about years with my american standard i was itching to change up the look so i changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers i didn t need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts i wanted seperately the back plate is a single ply mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories this will give you a matching back plate you can never go wrong with real fender parts i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners and what a difference i had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them the locking mechanism is great it acts like a vice in a woodshop project and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just don t go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times i bend the strings these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune this arm is a direct replacement for the original it is a bit to long for my liking and i may shorten it down in the near future although not through amazon com i recently purchased a seagull s original acoustic guitar i compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range as well as with the seagull entourage acoustic electric which was also in the general price range the s has a nicely consistent tone which although maybe a little too bright for some players tastes projects very well some reviewers and guitarists with whom i ve talked wonder how seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in north america for the price i think that i found part of the answer when i looked inside some of the seagulls the braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it though you d never know i find the neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left hand fingering it s a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width for me it works some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width the slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering but not so short as to cause floppy strings i couldn t be happier with the seagull s especially for the price it fits perfect on my mim stratocaster enhancing the visuals of the back the corona california on the back ads a nice touch when you compare it to the other fender f neck plate looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before i replaced it with this one good upgrade fender vintage springs use of them in my case and they work well i would recommend this there s no substitute for the right part these are great i like having extras around just in case i rescue another orphaned guitar to rebuild the springs are almost always missing cost less here than at guitar center so bada bing this amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from modelling amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five flavor settings in each they are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you ve switched gears here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you d have to be right up on them to see how they are set i ve had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned it s velcroed on there just fine the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather like material plenty loud
677	i use this one spot adapter with the pedal attachment works perfectly i ve seen reviews about this brand being noisy i suspect this to be happening with the pedal version too many for one simple volt source to handle i ve owned it for a couple of months used it at home days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times zero hum or buzz from the unit i should also mention that i do not have any drive distortion pedals on my board these fender pickguard screws are excellent they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment i replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they re much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent first i don t like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my fender blues deville sound distorted they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal there s a difference think about it if you don t get it second i don t like having a lot of pedals i play in a rock country band were we play music that sounds like neil young tom petty ccr etc just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of chords and an occasional minor th i just want an overdrive my digitech bad monkey and my arion tuner but i need distortion when we do covers ac dc hendrix etc the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to but of course then it s too loud based on those criteria the digitech cm is perfect the classic overdrive setting allows me to sound like hendrix or rocking neil young or any other rock band from the s and s the modern setting allows me to sound more like s and s rock e g guns n roses and soundgarden and this is important both settings make my amp sound like it is being overdriven it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point it sounds fricken awesome it does not sound like an amplified pedal so i can use the bad monkey i ve reviewed it on amazon if you want to read it for boosting my clean sound i use the cm if i want to play dirtier and for covers two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want i m happy i replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my indiana guitar and what a difference the original equipment spring tension was so stiff that the tremolo didn t even work now it sounds great
678	many reviews cover the pro s of this item so i ll be short only to add that they are very sturdy when install properly suggestion find a wall stud and use screws for heavier instruments used in our house to hang acoustic guitars and strat s haven t had an issue with any in the months we ve had them up on the electrics we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable the hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free as a guitar player i recently march started to play the uke i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument these string play good and stay in tune pretty well i will buy again works for a cheap bridge on my cheap stratocaster knock off needed one that was better than the bridge that came with it and this was a cheap but not cheaply built option this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp seems well built and rugged although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace it s not an entire bridge assembly but it s exactly what i needed in my opinion it is worth the money i have an abundance of strat parts so when a vintage non strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench i plunked these on the pots the customer liked them so much he kept them on now what to do with these other knobs
679	the strings have a nice feel to them used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase they improved the action considerably very pleased these are great strings i thought the bullet end was bs hype but i really think it makes the string stronger and the sound clearer and even if that is my rusty ears lying to me i can say with conviction that they definitely fit better with my g l legacy guitars regular strings had the little extra wind from the ball end coming right up to the saddle in some cases these solve that problem i bought this so i had no mess with cables on the board and i m happy to say it works perfectly it has everything you could ask for on a pedalboard and not only works with behringer i have suhr boss fender marshall dunlop and tc pedals and they fit very well it comes with cables and configuration diagram ideas not to mention it s a great advantage for taking it on the road without having to dissemble everything now my gear is always ready wow something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit i thought i was buying the footer and realize i ordered the footer too late let s be honest here what good is a foot amp chord unless you re sitting on the amp my bad i never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the footers as it does for the footers i would not recommend buying a footer unless you practice in a closet so glad i found these three sides much easier for me to hold thin is in as a beginner these make much more comfortable one of the my favorite thigns about strats is how easy they are to modify customize after about years with my american standard i was itching to change up the look so i changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers i didn t need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts i wanted seperately the back plate is a single ply mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories this will give you a matching back plate you can never go wrong with real fender parts there are something special about these strings they ring so bright and beautiful i absolutely love them for my fenders i honestly don t use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele they re gorgeous sounding especially when new i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john view tips and guidelines headline more words required these are perfect but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed i would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package i have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don t match they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves the heavy bottons and adds a boom in the tone the others and are nicely and decent tone also i don t rate it stars for the lack of vci when i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection the high strings were plenty of flakes if fender solved that it would be perfect these seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which i will appreciate for a long while rock on this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great it alows you to fine tune each string buy it this is great for those who already own strap locks and just want to gear up the rest of your collection no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use the price was ok wow these cables are made really sturdy and the noiseless feature is priceless definitely a real good value for the money these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time got a cleaner polish wax type ointment for every part of your guitar comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal the fret pad is great and i didn t know about this type of thing till getting this kit also comes with a step by step stage by stage instruction pamphlet worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed
680	i bought two of these one for each of my sons and i wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age so far they seem awesome they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them definitely not a flimsy stand i ve been recording professionally for years music radio commercials and television mostly so i ll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase i ve owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i can t remember them all but i can i say i ve never had a bad a t s s and s i use every week and have for years the going back to the mid s and the is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a t family you have no idea the of recordings that you re hearing this brand on it s used by almost every studio on every continent i work in the us italy to scotland and can attest to this but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best so it requires a phantom powered xlr input which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces which you should really purchase along with this if you haven t already because for around you ll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring you ll find one by searching audio interfaces i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don t need avid hd s to get started audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option don t try an adapter on it it won t work as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want it doesn t come with the cord what a surprise quality cords will cost about half the price of this but a version will probably do for most it doesn t come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like work with it you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do you ll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual but i can also recommend using large foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen this isn t about being cheap there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don t work at strange angles and you ll probably always need one or the other this does not come with a stand so pick up a boom stand if you don t have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over wheelers also tip over recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they ve put a faux plastic one if it s possible you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male for desktop users here s what i d do using large command strips and velcro i d fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini boomhere s another optionmxl mics mxl bcd standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting if you need something figure it out your clean quiet recording is proof that it works i can t justify comparing this to my to mics like it but if there is a better value buy it wouldn t have bought a case for most of my condensers it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics the is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a without issue also individual mics have a sound of the eight s i have i prefer of them and use them the most so when reviewers say it s bright i say compared to what i can tell you what it sounds like ka ching a great sound in audio recording uh huh i know of one professional recording it s on and the client was clueless that i used an mic think about it would this be as good as what was used years ago have you heard good s recordings anyone purchasing equipment because it sounds better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it lot s of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don t ignore them but ask yourself this do they have formal training and experience with different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost and won t be half of what you ll achieve by improving your recording technique this type of mic is excellent for overhead acoustics amps or brass and of course vocals really most recording needs having a less uni and more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it s better suited to recording just understand you can t get too loud near it or you ll overdrive it since it s designed for up to screaming vocals so back off with loud amps and brass which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it ll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor s tv that is a good thing what s bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment so don t blame a mic for your extraneous room noise you can t just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind just quiet anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical rather than electronic signal to noise ratio a db pad will reduce output but doesn t affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won t help that s not even its purpose i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam music tutsplus dot com tutorials beginners guide to acoustic treatment audio just replace the dot turn off your heat air be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between and am when the world s a quieter place and that will really help you ll likely hear how loud your computer fans are you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions but you need quiet i ve known acoustic players who ve worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing if this is what your budget allows for it s an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost i keep saying this type of mic and the reason why is because a t sells models like this style up to this model is the lowest priced but you re buying a reputable brand if your future plans include using only one mic without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware you can look here audio technica at usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at usb cardioid condenser microphone w pop filterthis is not my advice you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface this model is not usb now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds i won t tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won t apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio descriptions are worthless only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters this is important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn t the recording cannot sound better than the source so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone accurate or inaccurate not good or bad there s a difference it s during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound apply these same thoughts to your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than the recording and that s why accuracy is important in your monitors so search out any info you don t understand and don t expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling training and having worked in a professional setting if you re lucky like i was after year of tech school i worked on site repair studios often need pt and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next then after years of work tv with another year of school i became a studio owner real recording involves a facility equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital so study electronics acoustics the auditory cortex everything audio train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day it never stops when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn t mean you re educated in its use so yes i also don t recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother unless but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording quit all that sleeping eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk i have so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i m just here to help you out if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out topping tp digital mini amplifier bought these as an extra set just in case i made a mistake when i was trying to cut down my nut and bridge they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha did not end up using them but will one day great product for the price was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal especially a delay for this price but i figured how can you go wrong if it s not good at least you re not out a lot of money i ve been thoroughly impressed with this pedal much more sturdy than it appears in photos i actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it works great so far and don t regret purchasing worth every dime where else can you get a great functioning delay pedal for this price this neck plate rides on the body of a mexico made jazz bass which i acquired second hand replacing the blank factory plate it could be thicker it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender f logo i have about different types of tuners and this is the best of them all i have small kids and birds around the house so many tuners get lost with the noise this one works off the vibration of the guitar so it is right every time even with a lot of noise around these things are so great i get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and i d have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick with these i can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere the thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups very nice one thing yo note is they like to cling to each other so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it but not that big a deal definitely recommend these if you re sick of picks slipping out of your hands got the pack and oh what a great difference on me my guitar and my sound i m a yo newby to guitar this proves that easy helps i have a big baby taylor and when i needed new strings i went to the wrong place got martins installed wow did they make a bad diference to me sounded like a s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play my friend said that he uses d addario and that they make all the difference in the world tried them and he was right i changed my own on the big baby and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position instead of switching the e and b string like the dealer did my taylor recommends elixr but the d addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers how you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar you re using it on what works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another i can say with confidence that this capo works flawlessly on an american standard strat fits great easy on off easy adjustments the padding on the capo is such that you would really have to go out of your way to mar the finish on your neck with it all relevant areas of the capo are well padded it seems very well constructed after two weeks of heavy use i don t see why it wouldn t last for years just slipped this windscreen on my mic a wireless brand and it barely fit perfectly any smaller and it would be going in the trash the foam is obviously of good quality and it s plenty thick i m using it mainly to protect the mic s metal screen but also to keep others germs off the mic seeing as how they tend to put their mouths on it best price and overall value compared to the name brands this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more for the price of this winder cutter its awesome if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect good quality bag for my epi lp fit like a glove in fact i wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories not too much to say it s made out of foam made to slip between the strings made to hold two picks i have several of these for acoustics and for electrics my son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won t be dislodged still it does stay on majority of the time i do recommend this my son s guitar teacher calls this a fancy little pick holder and i ve had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time one must also be careful my son lost one of these so i know it is a possibility of it falling off he lost it after performing in a play on stage please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i started using these a few years ago picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps if you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home this is it have not gigged with it as yet so no comments as to its toughness great value though i normally use dunlop s mm nylon picks but decided to give the mm max grips a try when the price dropped to for a dozen the top half of the max grips have a special surface with tiny ridges that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip the feeling is a little strange at first but you should get used to it quickly i like the feel and playability of the mm max grip s but they are little more flexible than i prefer so if i were to get another set i would get a thicker type either mmor mm
681	use it every time i restring my guitar works really good i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary this strap is comfortable has plenty of room to expand it to fit and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes i really like it i have used the manhasset orchestra light and this is definitely an improvement it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page unlike the manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m regal conductor s music standquite well by itself having said that for a bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me in both construction and light brightness it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights all of which are usually much cheaper the issue being mainly the light switch the jury is out about the clamp though it seems strong of course as an orchestra light it couldn t be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose i am just pointing out that i feel it isn t worth dollars when you consider the whole field of similar lights those not intended for orchestra i bought this because of reputation and reviews but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor therechargeable music stand led light clip on leds with adapter that one has the same negative issues as this light but at a much more acceptable plus free shipping one more thing you should ignore the frequently bought together suggestion to get themighty bright bright light cradlefor this light i bought it and can confirm they are totally incompatible and anyways this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping if desired i have used d addario for a number of years i m not hot about their acoustic but electric they re a whole new world i like these nickel on my tele they give them that extra twang let me start off saying that you cannot go wrong buying any of the series of mighty bright music stand lamps the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design and the carrying case makes it very portable fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to works great the unit uses three aa batteries i started off using batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours i prefer to use the foot adapter cord i am an older person who has old eyes sometimes lower c and lower a look alike mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue the clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe however the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on top some comments have indicated that when plugging the ac adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected the unit i purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip to confirm this on your unit disconnect the ac adapter from the wall and from the light load batteries into the clip and turn on the light finally with the ac adapter still disconnected from the wall outlet plug the cable into the base the light should go out if it doesn t your unit is not isolating the batteries from the ac adapter and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the ac adapter is plugged in this pick up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically it does pick up percussive noise which you don t get with under saddle pickups it is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don t use a sound hole cover over all i m please because i was able to install myself and it was simple you do need to use an external pre amp but even with piezo pick ups that is usually the norm the directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions the only change i had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too this unit is the perfect solution for people whose amps do not have mute switches for tuning it has an absolutely silent mode that mutes for tuning without clicks or pops when switched in and its bypass tuner off mode is totally transparent to tone its tuning modes make selecting one that works best for you extremely simple i personally prefer full strobe its tuning is quick and accurate and it doesn t hunt for pitches like some tuners will especially with a string bass its single volt battery is only used when the mute tuner mode is activated so the battery should last a long long time the display is bright and clear it s rugged well thought out solidly built and simple my only complaint is with the calibration mode it s just a series of non self explanatory numbers that change when you hit the calibration button its explained in the manual but could be clearer i d buy this again without hesitation though
682	you may have experienced the problems of musicians the drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late but you need to rehearse this gets the job done you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want the thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack otherwise easy and a great product the best is that if you are playing really poor lead work nobody can hear but you lol nice straplock system very easy to install as compared to other systems the system is a secure locking system this is my favorite locking system i have in my arsenal my axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing years i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i didn t care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith i picked up the lp special in black at guitar center for and they kicked in free strings bought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer tone my lp studio had it s pickups replaced with the zakk wylde s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price you literally cannot find a better guitar for than the special sound two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic not sure which they have so much sustain for a bolt on neck i was shocked build quality i did have problem with the high e tuner i didn t notice in the store but the string peg was up out of the headstock when i discovered this i loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way intonation required no adjustment action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow the finish was perfect no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed damn good for a bolt on hardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very well back bending headstock and x orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it no pickguard and it doesn t need one lots of relief between strings and body you won t find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick makes it easy to clean too truss rod is behind a nice body color plate frets were smooth rounded and played nice could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasn t an issue k pots and side body trplug keeps the cable out of the way overall came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other guitar summary this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box it s well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music the frets are medium jumbo s and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re fretting than a typical affinity or bullet squiers in this price range i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music i did blues metal country and pop the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldn t fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil i ended up putting the screws back in i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in hell yeah coil tapping here i come and move my emg s in this lp special and make myself a nice little metal guitar do yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar it s cheap enough that you won t care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years i put this puppy on in minutes or less they fit perfect on my american standard stratocaster they work like a charm if you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat this are a no brainier the price is right and they look great on your stratocaster my revised review after about a year of use the one thing i hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out so if you re not careful your guitar will fall it is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap once every few days my original review very easy to install didn t require drilling i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes although it looks a little bit big and clunky it s a small price to pay for stability i probably will get another set but may get the black ones instead of the silver because i think the black color may hide the clunkyness a little better overall a very good product this is a very nice cable i like this one better than all the other ones that i own its thick and the sound is great then one day an amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off that stunk very good cable well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele the reason i gave it only stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor
683	i ve been a gigging musician for almost years and this is the most well made most comfortable guitar bass strap i ve ever used pros substantial padding where you need it perfect stitching heavy stiff leather ends soft fine woven material not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps underside is lined with an even softer material makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on did i mention it s super comfortable cons none to speak of seriously it s that phenomenal perfect whether you re rocking a featherweight strat or a pound string bass i use it with a pound string warwick bass and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me i hardly notice i m actually wearing it combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks and it could easily last you years you will not be sorry with this purchase i am a bass player and most winders don t work very well with the large tuning keys this one works better than anyone i have tried none of them work as good as i would like once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results i love my hd got it a while back but have just started to explore it s capabilities sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things the possibilities are endless wonderful i love it am sure you will too enjoy i use it to wind my strings i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast very easy to use this is a great winder steel shaft will probably last one of these should come standard issue with every guitar over the past couple of months i ve been replacing guitar straps this one seemed ideal for an everyday all around strap and it would be but the holes are too tight really a major chore to get over a strap button i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap i ve probably bought dozens of straps over the past forty plus years and i never had this problem until the latest straps i ve purchased so this strap isn t the only one with which i ve had an issue a tight fitting strap isn t in itself a problem except when one needs to take it off yikes otherwise this is a nice strap oh i tried the strap on three guitars just to be sure the first wasn t an anomaly let me start of by saying this tuner is great my previous tuner was a korg ca and frankly that tuner is terrible the main differences between sat and the ca sat has a build in light ca does not ca has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a deg angle sat does not sat has a auto and manual mode ca has auto sat displays the octave of the note e g e e etc ca displays only displays the alphabet e for all oactaves sat has a numerical display for the cents off ca does not what made me get a new tuner is how finicky the ca when using the build in mic the needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner yes it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability another issue with the ca is the poor screen the screen is so dark and only viewable head on the ca does not have any of the flaws of the ca and is even more accurate what this tuner has accuracy usability durability versatility what more can you ask from a tuner of this price this thing is a tank i don t think you could break this beast if you wanted to the last string winder you will ever buy i have a martin hd with the large grover tuners this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly if you change your strings regularly this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tuners for these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time
684	there good mics can t complain about a price like this does the job just fine for what it is not really anything more you could ask for comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most if not all microphones folds up nice and small happy all around our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses it looks very stylish and functional as well nice pic s that work well when you are really jammin on a tune
685	i did not think that an amp this size would sound good boy was i surprized this amp out does my old roland cube this amp is loud very loud and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound all in all a super amp these are great strings for such a rare instrument not many people play the baritone yuke it has a unique quality to it sort of like a miniature classical guitar these strings sound full and warm on the instrument this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole it would not work for an f hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides the dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly don t push it all the way in after moistening and you won t have a problem i drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the d and g strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole they can t be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings i ve never had one of these move from where i left it if the sponge isn t dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case when the humidity is very low or less the sponge dries out in to days even if the case isn t opened as with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days if you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar or don t want to see one use a guitar humidifier especially during the winter heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels between and is ideal for most guitars air conditioning can do the same for especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar s is okay for many reasons it s always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use a humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly this is an overpriced item that is my only complaint there s enough reviews on here that state the obvious it is small it sounds good and can keep up with a little jazz trio by itself which is amazing however i have to say i m super uber pissed that the day after i bought this amp at sam ash for it dropped to about how does an amp just come down half price over night i mean what kind of scam was this company running if they can afford to stay in business and sell them half the price than they were originally marked at it s like the blue blocker sunglasses on tv they re sold for months later you can get them in the barging bin for at cvs this is not ethical business this is trying to get as much as you can from your customers with no regard to true value ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors edit just read another guy who gives it stars because it can be used as a weapon to knock someone out not sure if this amp deserves the stars it is getting and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley i stand by my logically opinions of this item zt should not have sold this for in the first place it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs they can be configured as a master slave set up with a single link cable a inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per cm in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient the low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ i have run both aroland rd nx digital pianoandroland v combo vr the grand piano setting on the rd nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the b emulation from the v combo i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand s down bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances i use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you however once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument s volume and eq controls there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand first the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm to the floor not exceed inches i agree this may be relatively small but it s heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high it s easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended i have the pt which is not backlit so i bought this one for use in dimly lit venues it worked great right out of the box put in the battery clipped it onto a standard acoustic guitar headstock turned it on and began tuning the display is big x bright even in a bright room and when the string is in tune the backlit background turns from red to green like christmas i put on a brand new set of strings and used it to bring each one up to pitch i found that plucking the string with your finger and then adjusting makes the tuner waver less probably because fewer overtones are being produced all of these type of tuners have some degree of hesitancy when reading the string pitch moreso on some of the strings than others but i found that this unit locked in on the signal quickly and gave a very accurate reading i can use a pick to pluck the string as well and this device after a very brief pause less than a th of a second gives me a reading or gives me the green i don t use any of the other features i also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument the only other comment i have about it is that the on button should have been placed on the top of the unit as you clip it onto the headstock but i just mount the unit over towards one side and turn it on and off from the bottom i would highly recommend this for a anyone looking to quickly tune up a guitar in a noisy dimly lit room update august replaced the battery after years with a good quality sony lithium and the tuner is still going strong
686	these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used my main complaint is the very small size i haven t got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick i find the dava master control more to my liking for most things but i still use the jazz iii s from time to time when i just want a simple clean pick tone i started with the flimsy grays a couple years ago i switched to yellows recently i ve been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this your used to using big picks which strum hard easily with these i noticed i have to strum in a tighter stronger pattern than before to get the same tones anyway the attack on this pick is so just yes it flows in sweeps like yes i will never switch from the pick oh ya the grip is perfect haven t popped one outa my fingers yet just my two cents nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks i ve never had a problem with these patch cables i m running pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out one thing that is important to note is that i m not hard on my gear i m a home noodler so i can t say if these patches can take road stage abuse and lots of setup tear down cycles they seem pretty buff and capable but i can only report what i ve experienced i m a bass player and so i don t deal with cut picks much these picks are really hard and last forever i did not notice any additional string wear or damage these would probably better suited to guitarists this is a great effect i am very happy with it awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there it is very sensitive and delivers as it should with a delay rate from to miliseconds most units offer a max of around the mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended i had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method good picks though this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended these are the thickest picks i ve ever used however i am really liking them the tone they give seems better to my ears than anything i ve tried and my speed picking has improved i plugged in the amp and i plugged in the bass and there were no issues with the wire this is one of those products you don t want to overly notice and in that it has done the job is is designed for i think these jazz picks are awesome nice and light with a gripped texture so you don t have worry about them flying when you solo i only wish that more came in a single pack these picks are a good change of pace they are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers good investment for the price sounds and feels nice i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster it came with entry level strings these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument be advised the low e string is thick when i try to depress the th fret i can t get it to register as a hit with rocksmith unless i press hard with my middle or index finger well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game these picks are fantastic but smaller then picks i ve used in the past but easy to hold onto due to the shape and texture very durable believe these are smaller for jazz use i own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them i use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage the ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very slinky i e not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be and a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price i ve been playing guitar for years and lately i ve been wanting some slinkier strings so i can get a little more bend out of them i thought i d try these out and i loved them after playing with these for a week i loved the way that they played and i loved the way they sound so i ordered more packs of these the extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely won t find a better set of strings for the money i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired with fretted basses i d always liked strings with a little brassiness but round wounds just didn t feel or sound right on a fretless small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction and round wounds just didn t have that acoustic sound there were quite a few choices for fretless strings but i ve always liked d addarios on my string guitars these flat wounds were a perfect choice they ve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings the bass sounds more like a real bass and the action is now so smooth i can use a small vibrato when i like no longer restricted to the wide jaco style there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds but there s something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home these picks are nice but just too small my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size they work well just need to be a little bigger i bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well i like the thickness of this pick easy to hang onto when strumming love the tone i can obtain too let me be upfront i often use my electric guitar unplugged when i am plugged in i don t move around a lot so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing but no hum or noise and seems solid it was very affordable can t say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time but for the price i can not complain at all i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage i don t use these alot but when i play jazz style music or ballads they work better without playing with heavy attack and give a more mellow tone to the solo s a very nice pick both in feel and texture the design is a bit boring though only complaint is that it s fairly small about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a cent piece but that s okay i got this the same time as i got a set of dava jazz grip red picks and the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks and i think i like the dava picks the best all three are tight grip picks and all the same size they re all good though i d rate this one next best and the jazz iii carbon fiber next after that needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand it is a plastic casing but i don t tour so that won t be a problem i needed the effect and it gives it fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume don t spend on a boutique pedal get this one
687	sounded good warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac i rocked all night and loved the sound next day i turned it on my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock id like to see a real set of jjs im sure one of them was a dud what can you say at less than incl shipping it s a steal i was looking for a very inexpensive version of the popular sansamp and this does it for me decent svt flip top or fat tube tone and a nice quiet di i go di to the house and the output into my old seymour duncan amp aguilar gs cab great tone i m using a vdc class ii wall wart found it in my spare parts closet vs v batteries with the wall wart no di hum great does eat batteries so get yourself a power supply never use the foot switch if used at all i use my finger if broken or lost who would steal it i d buy another in a heart beat i just bought a rickenbacker that came with schaller strap locks pre installed i ve used dunlops before but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass so i just bought the schaller buttons i don t quite like their look as well as the large round dunlops but there s no question about the quality these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband the bad reviews here are bizarre written by inept people who either can t handle the install or have a buggy pc or os i was up and running minutes after i tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging there s plenty of specs details videos on the interwebs about this software go do some research see if you like it it s way better than the drum kits that come with garageband and there s plenty of kits to expand with i got the vintage rock kit and i love it almost as much as i love pizza which i will marry some day i like a cheese pizza some call it plain but with the right blend of sauce cheese and crust there s nothing plain about it it s somewhat complex much like myself we are a perfect match pizza and me we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom i m not exclusively a thin crust guy sometimes i dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish the only weak point in this pizza i mean software is that you can t do a cymbal swell apparently it s the same with all these virtual kits regardless of brand but it would be nice if someone toontrack would address it by including a side stick attack on the crashes if you try to do a cymbal swell you hear the initial stick on cymbal ting with each attack so it s kind of a ting ting ting ting sound instead of bwooooosssshhhhh i m sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a ting ting bwoosh loop no ting ting do i get a fortune cookie with that pizza time ohhh myyyy loooove my darlin i hun ger for your crust ok i am a pro musician rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road i was using an old ibenez chorus pedal one of the first to hit the market of which i did not use much basically due to it s used for certain songs i upgraded from using separate pedal boards to a single unit decided to buy the boss ch super chorus to add to the collection after my first gig i removed the ibenez chorus pedal because of the tonal superiority of the boss unit i am certain there are units that may boast of being better but i have found through my years of playing that more money is not always better great tones easy operation and it is the best bet for the money
688	i love this little tuner it s better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar and as accurate and easier to use than the one on my vox tonelab st i m planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case this keyboard far exceeded my expectations for the price the quality of most of the bread and butter sounds is very high this keyboard also has tons of neat features there s something here for musicians of any skill level check out yamaha s product blurb to get an idea of how good this keyboard can sound search ypg on youtube and check out trying out my yamaha ypg by joshthemusician since it s also keys unweighted midi usb compliant very portable and can even run on batteries in a pinch the ypg could be used in a variety of situations one star off for a couple of caveats below other than that at around this instrument is a steal in my mind the only negatives aside from trying to install the usb midi driver see below are that yamaha sells this keyboard without the ac adapter and sustain pedal as standard accessories and you really need both yamaha should note that a lot of people feel burned by the non inclusion of the ac adapter note for those wanting to use this keyboard via usb midi on a windows systemthe usb midi drivers for this instrument are provided on a cd the disk i got only contained drivers up to windows vista i tried cheating and using this driver on my win system but it didn t work the cd will supply you with a link that should take you directly to the latest driver downloads but it doesn t i ran into a lot of problems going that route i suggest you bypass trying to use the link the cd suggests and just go directly to the yamaha website to get the latest driver much easier and my ypg now works fine with my computer but still surprising since most usb midi keyboards are plug and play okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic a great addition and will serve me well i have been using an old elastic bar capo for years because the last spring capo i used did not have nearly enough tension when i first applied the planet waves tri action capo i thought here we go again there was ample tension e g but b and e were buzzy as all get out not expecting much i adjusted the tension it took a couple of tries to get it just right but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar zero buzz across the board that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze on and off it looks nice i have the black version as well as its comparative ease on the wallet and this capo is a rock solid five star product this capo also has a pick holder the feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo s overall size and shape but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself get this capo i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks they are so grippy i haven t broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so it s hard to loose them but i still do if you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while you re playing they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the mm picks for that
689	should have kept this i returned it cause i purchased a zoom r big mistake miss it on smaller projects and my mxl sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks he thinks it great too i was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this saturday s st patrick s day parade i took a chance on this kit even though i have never purchased anything that says pyle on the label upon receiving this kit my first surprise was the quality of the case and then upon opening i was surpised to find that these were the exact same microphones as the ones i borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings but branded differently he paid about for his kit still cheap by today s standards i pulled out overhead condensor and the kick drum mic and mounted them fired up the pa and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic we could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit or two overheads they pick up everything very clearly i turned up the volume on the kick drum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly too small mic now i have a wonderful drum mix coming from only microphones and my mixer has more channels free than i would have expected for fun i added one of the tom snare mics and they sounded equally clear after purchasing this i can tell you that there is absolutely no way i would purchase one of the high end drum mic kits if you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound this is it i promise you will love the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound shipped in time didn t test microphones yet but i think this is best price for microphones according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well i ll check it later i ve used these at every gig i have run sound at for months and so far they have passed the test with flying colors they allow me to concentrate on other more important things than the reliability of my cables for the money this thing sounds just fine i got it for my son to toy around with he barely ever uses it but the times it s been plugged in it puts out pretty good sound for the price
690	i purchased this sometime around september and when i received it i tested it and it seemed to work correctly i ve had no trouble with it that i can remember think of this is a great microphone it s light sensitive and looks professional i used this alongside my xonar dg sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted db i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for while this isn t the new break through tech or the rave of the much much higher end mics it does deliver with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response been giggin since the early s and have been hosting an open mic to boot i get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice super affordable microphone it s a charm b b i ordered two pdmic s and they came with an xlr to cable included however the quality of these cables are mediocre at best i recommend purchasing a higher quality cable with your order now to the performance this mic is built like a tank yes as others have said it is somewhat heavy but not too heavy in other words it doesn t feel like a cheap as for the sound quality i would have to say out of because the mic doesn t sound as clear as i would like it to be now i m not a professional but this is just my opinion i m not saying it sounds muddy but it sounds tinny you ll have to see for yourself other reviews have also said that this is a great back up mic or karaoke mic i agree however if you are looking to record professional sounding tracks you won t find it at this price value to me i think it s definitely a mic worth having even if it s just laying around at this price you can t beat it it s a great mic for the price update after using this microphone for a while i find it to be somewhat lacking don t get my wrong though for the price it definitely performs as it should however if you are looking to make quality recordings i would pass on this purchase good cable doesn t tangle very good ends if you have a better mic you can plug that into the transmitter as it s a simple mini jack and that helps this sound wise quite a bit i will say range is not great it won t go feet like my expensive sennheiser kit but this will go about feet line of sight before cutting out note it s vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference i find the transmitters to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well i also wish it was an xlr connection a lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so don t toss this around or it will break for general use in doors it s decent and for sure worth the price but if you re looking for something clear you should look to spend at least on a wireless lapel or handheld system i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine i ve had these on my yamaha apx for a while now and they sound really good a tad brighter than i like but that s just the nature of the lightness of the strings it s real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings i try in fact i ve had these strings on for over months now and they still feel and sound good this thing sounds great with my tube amps both with my watt danelectro amp from with it s inch speaker and my watt excelsior from fender it has a good range of overdrive levels it is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lo fi stuff like the black keys the white stripes and garage band like stuff it is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz i love mine for the price and its a good mix up compared to my modded sd and my overdriven tube amps it s different and just worth having to mess around with just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last also the blue led is very bright thats either an annoyance or great rock on totally awesome strings i ve heard other strings are great too but i highly recommend everyone try these if you haven t outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time elixirs for life i d pay double for these strings all day great value using it as a back up stage mic sound very good and for the price it can t be beat it does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics but gets the job done when needed stars because it works as its described and has a nice display i like this better than my old snark it s got a better build quality than the snark for sure i love this amp here are the reasons solidly made everything is high quality best of all it comes with fender fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your pc using the usb cable included and control all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the amp without even touching the knobs including special effects like various stomp box add ins effects like reverb distortion phaser factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the pc screen visually you can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created if you want to play a pink floyd song you can download a david gilmour preset and there you go you got your dark side of the moon and the wall preset ready to go this is so cool and watts beats and works for me i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program it was delivered fast when i hooked it up i didn t expect it to be so loud and clear so powerful it picked up every breath i took between the lyrics when i put a wind screen on it the sound was so nice i couldn t stop singing for another hour i only meant to test it when i unpacked it i m buying more at that price it s a steal get a couple now before supply and demand kicks in i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe it s very thin all parts about it are kinda thin and cheap but it works exactly as it should not bad if you just need to round out an order to get free shipping not for your favorite guitar though more of a beginner s or a throw away gig strap this little unit is packed with great effects for i m very impressed has just about everything you need in a entry level pedal except for a pedal control this is a excellent snare wire used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old pearl snare drum quick and easy to replace came with straps to secure but did not use them as i prefer string improved the snare sound by no more rattle snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound well made product that did the trick product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect great product at a excellent price cheap stands get the job done i have problems so far i ve taken them from new jersey to south carolina after first receiving the wrong item not a mike at all amazon promptly corrected the error and sent the microphone ordered this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect for under twenty dollars pyle pro can t be beat just be mindful it s inexpensive because it s made in china but it doesn t feel cheap in any way the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the midrange and upper registers while the low end is slightly attenuated for most singers it will be just what they need the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam d portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device the tascam d is known for this noise issue but it usually only occurs using an unbalanced non xlr input in this case the unbalanced cable that comes with the mike actually works better with the tascam than the xlr to xlr cable
691	its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting squire fender guitar in terms of e to e string spacing the low e string out of range and not fit in the hole great tone and tuning stability was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat really helped with the bigsby tuning stability good but it not fit properly defenley better then bone thogh i did have to sand it to try to make it fit good and i did put it on my epiphone lp it does give a nice blues tone beause it s not bone but i had to take it off case it just did not fit right perfect replacement did have to take off a little on either side but other than that it fits i used it on a first act me love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses
692	my partner won t put a pickup in his guitar and i get tires of luggin an amp around along with the rest of the sys so this does the trick clip on the boom stand stick a sm on it and an sm to sing in and your set holds tight this is a very simple product and as others have stated you could probably just diy one pretty easily but for this price why bother under and this thing is as good as ones that range from i don t think the material the time it is going to take for you to make one about mins an hour more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and voila it arrives two days later no fuss no muss assuming you have prime because well who doesn t these days plus this will look good on camera i love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more i m hoping they last a while strong metal construed legs open to set up easy easy to set mic slides in or out up or down peaces stay tight it is not a bad mic for the price if you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over bucks but it is no comparison to a studio mic since i have worked in a recording studio now you need to decide what you want getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for it is like having hd tv and bd player but playing an ordinary cd you would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer speakers and so on if you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic this mic is quite good for its price i would probably say it exceeds your expectations arrived as promised in a frustration free packing also make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit the only reason i did not give stars is mine had a little dent on the body may be due to transportation but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks it s very small it s a fabric stretchy capo the old type that s quite difficult to stretch and make stay it s made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo but the end isn t very long and i don t trust it to stay while playing for long i ll keep it as a spare just in case anyway i m using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation it works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer you will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records khz but skips when duplexed i mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabled the following settings are the best i ve been able to manage in jackd without and xruns on a realtime kernel using qjackctl i m also no expert frames period sample rate periods buffer which gives a predicted latency of mswith a ft inch patch cord to run jack iodelay i got a consistent ms overall latency not bad imho without the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings my computer is a sandy bridge pentium ghz with gb ram and a ssd we have used this with an at at sm microphones and the sound quality is quite high the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding i ve also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds rain crickets and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the house update i ve found the above setting in jack don t work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack here are the best setting i could come up withframes period sample rate peiods buffer realtimesoft modeqjackctl lists the latency of ms but i have not tried measuring i with jack iodelay all the included effects of rakarrack work on my computer for these while booted in the hard realtime kernel i picked these up on impulse they were on a good sale and i was dissatisfied with my older cheaper set of panasonic over the ears i m glad i did these are excellent headphones and they ve exceeded my expectations on just about every level the sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise they feel extremely sturdy and well made from the cans themselves to the nice thick coiled cord although a removable cord would be a nice bonus finally and this is important they re incredibly comfortable as a video editor i often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time the cans rotate on two axis so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and well padded they grip your head snugly without that horrible vice grip feeling i ve heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under i haven t tried enough pairs to make that judgement but i will say that i highly recommend them it s one of the best purchases i ve made in a long time this works just as stated now i can plug my mic in either way and it gives me more versitility if i didn t think that purchasing these items from amazon i wouldn t do it plus and more important i have worked as a purchasing coordinator for over years now i know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not i can find even cables that i can t find in radioshack best buys no where else i have done a lot of purchasing not just for myself but for business these ladies and gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way i would like to apply for a position with them regards ffsalsa this is a solid product i ended up not needing it so i returned it however it worked fine and gets the job done i have a blue snowball mic and the stand that comes with that thing is entirely too short for my needs so i set out to find a desk stand for my microphone that i could use for podcasting and video work here are my pros and cons pros it s about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball this may be too tall for some with the mic put in it stands as tall as my asus g vw but i have a raised desk so this fits right up to my mouth the snowball screws right in unscrew the holder thing that comes on there screw the snowball in win after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic cool it seems sturdy and well built cons the legs make this thing very very wide it s about the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird not bad just weird overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand it seems to be able to fit just about any mic and it s perfect for video voice overs and podcasts this was a great addition to our studio here at the price was great and quality was awesome highly recommend i don t know if they are the best haven t tried them all but from what i ve tried none are better d addarios are top quality and very reasonably priced my choice for string or string acoustics i m a bassist and am familiar with the flat round half round debate on basses i prefer flats anyway my son wanted these for his epiphone casino because he heard john lennon used a different brand of flat wounds they sound amazing they make that casino ring like a carillon yet will get down dirty when called for a very different sound range than round wounds in fact it s about time to order another set or three it does the job as described it though i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me i bought this for my martin d for recording on my pc so far it is working great i have a behringer mixer already and i just plugged the guitar into that it works perfectly this guitar is very loud without a pickup but to get the sound into my pc for recording i either needed to use a mike or a pickup i chose the pickup i got too much background noise with the mike update i started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out i had played my guitar about an hour before without that buzz being a problem i discovered that if i turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away then i remembered that the only thing i was doing differently was that i had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside i turned that light off and the buzz went away my pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light i m glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup after using the pickup for awhile i have noticed that the th and th strings aren t as loud as i would expect also the nd string is louder than all of the strings i m not sure why it s not a big deal monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time you cant go wrong with monster cables i am president of the international press association a global organization of photographers videographers and journalists we have been teaching our members to convert from shooting stills to videos on their dslr cameras i needed this cord and a shorter one for an important assignment on a cruise ship and these guys came through in time for me to use both cords you can see them in use at our online publication impress in this article and video thanks guys will be shopping with you again when you re looking into a quality cable you wouldn t expect to find such quality for this price range the construction is solid well insulated cording and having done some test recording with it i will definitely be purchasing more of these as the studio expands while there may be more expensive cables out there i feel that for the price you are getting something of a higher quality than you would expect didn t notice any defects and no static noise bleed despite being around lots of other audio equipment monitors etc even touring or in a mobile studio application i wouldn t be worried about this cable failing or noise bleed only regret is not picking up a few more at this price but i m sure to order more for future expansion not worried at all about using this cable as part of my signal chain and was relieved to have it shipped out and arrive in a timely manner quality product quality vendor light weight easy to install holds very well does exactly what it was designed to do hold a guitar on a wall i m a pro musician and music teacher these are the original pick punches by the company from the guy who invented them at least that s what it says on his website the others are knockoffs they probably all work about the same and they re all about the same price now so why not support the dude who invented them he s really into making picks and has some pretty cool ideas and instructions on his website i m pretty crafty and really like this bummed about rough edges buy a fine sanding sponge at any hardware store sand the edges for a few seconds and be done with it he also sells sheets of plastic from his website at quite good prices and ink for stamping them i got a cheap rubber stamp made with my url for about online and make my own business card picks now i also found some cool sheets of celluloid on ebay it s not easy to find the right stuff but the picks i make now are just as good as any you would purchase and the cost is way less for personalized pics anyway if you need hundreds or thousands of picks made well then you re better off ordering them but i have fun making or of them at a time to hand out to potential students and clients oh yeah i can still recycle old cards and stuff too my students like bringing them in and making their own picks as well everybody knows that picks just evaporate when you lose them anyway what could possibly be greener good quality cable i have other cables around it and was unsure about its shielding but have never noticed any feedback or hissing seems like it works just as described good delivery time too purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home the cable is great because it s long enough to allow us to move our mic where we need it i got this item much quicker than i expected the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition seller is a in my book if we need more of this type of equipment would certainly buy from them again so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable
693	i have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what i want it to it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet turn in half way up you get a clean sound crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous i own a piece of the legend and music history i was using a kyser capo until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn t hold all the strings down i thought i d try something else out and settled on this one it s easy to take on and off it s tight enough the main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so i think it will fit even the widest fretboards i don t know about a or string though i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record the notes don t bend easily if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly these are little more than toys compared to dollar harps they feel cheap but have a decent sound i dont know if they will last but to make harp noises without decent bends ill use these sparingly jim nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun quiet and durable wuhan makes great products for the money i have the medium crash and so i decided to try the both are great cymbals for the buck if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the s or s nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it the is a bit warmer than the the sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the bought wuhans the ride and a splash will review each one as they come in from amazon why the stars well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close if your on a budget like i am go for wuhans i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years this is a really good product and excellent crash wuhan really impresses me there are some great video s of wuhans on you tube you should really check those out before buying wuhans or any cymbal for that matter i am very pleased with this crash let me start by saying that i never even opened these i ve given it a star merely out of respect for hohner i have no clue how they play so you ll have to look at other review for that info i ordered this product based on the fact that the description states includes a deluxe red pro type hard shell case well not from music it doesn t when i asked music about this they said oh well we provide amazon with our catalogue and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items really not only did this not come in the red case which i didn t really care about anyway it didn t come in any version of this case style which i was interested in the case that s shown is the case that s sold individually on many sites for so i figured wow what the heck i m getting harmonicas that cost a piece if puchased individually and i m getting a case with them you d be silly not to bite on that right well they came in a cheaper nondescript black zipper case not the one with the hohner logo on it save your money and order this through musicians friend it s the same price free shipping and you get the actual item as it s described on their site in closing it s been a week since i sent this product back to music and i still have not received my refund do yourself a favor and avoid them i bought this mostly for the case and to have a few backup harps kicking around if i need them some of the harps are out of tune slightly not a big deal especially considering what all you get here this is an alright set for a beginner and a good cheap backup set for a more advanced harp blower i ll use the case for my higher end hohners as needed this hand full of picks saves your fingernails they are not the best but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size i am used to
694	i have bought several small tuners through the years but this one has become a favorite it is tiny but the screen is well lit and quite legible it fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front there is a metronome function which i haven t used simply strike a string if it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars when the key is in tune you will see a green indicator light and bar on each side i don t know how dependable and how long it will last since i have only had the two for about a month if your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise interference i installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music no more hum noise crackling etc overall this was an excellent buy great product easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass it would have been nice to get a little more of it though since this was just enough
695	item is as described you receive felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick mine was purple picks were defect free but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks which a clean moist cloth will easily fix but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument none the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit but over time this starts to disappear the picks are pretty comfy to hold too thick no flexibility sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results these picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side i was looking for a semi soft felt picks i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke i guess i don t like the way the uke sounds when using them it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff but i am sure other people may disagree as far as the quality and vendor delivery i am happy and i have no complaints i use the picks occasionally yes i would recommend them to other uke players i would like to let people know they are very stiff i guess i thought being felt they wouldn t be so stiff but i am new to playing an instrument and i guess i just don t have much knowledge about picks i usually keep pick in my mouth when i don t use them but sometimes i drop them and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it so this is a nice option to have a spare one if you use bass picks get this it is bigger than the guitar version much like the picks
696	i owned a boss graphic eq many years ago and never really took to it ah the folly of youth first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the on off switch if you have any tonal issues with your amp then a graphic eq is an easy solution no it won t make you love an amp you hate but if you re almost there or even just want to add some sonic variety you won t really realize how useful and vital a graphic eq is my rig right now is a strat and jazzmaster into a pro jr i love the amp but as the volume goes up the treble gets a bit piercing i ve been able to tame that issue with this pedal it s a subtle thing it takes some time to play around with the sliders and figure out what will really hit your amp s sweet spot at least in my application where i m leaving it on all the time this pedal would also be good for a solo boost as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch through overall for this price you can t go wrong this is one of those pedals that has a million applications and will always have a use in my setup i m thinking of getting a second one and building a pedalboard specific to my acoustic rig comp eq chorus reverb gorgeous strapped to my son s martin acoustic guitar he loves it it s pretty without distracting from the guitar itself very well made and durable i ve even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time this will last a very long time great deal for the price works fine but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric did the job for what i needed now i know i would love a better one like a fishman i d been shopping for a music stand at local music stores all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are plus tax this item including shipping cost me only about here from amazon and the seller musician s friend sent it promptly got it within business days without any problems i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions the bolts aren t as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand but i don t care about that it s not hard to adjust and most of the time i have it at a certain height so no need to fiddle with it but during a group performance it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother if you re someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height it s no big deal other than that it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should for price off retail excellent i m completely satisfied with this it does what its supposed to i really like that the bottom is adjustable and gets the guitar higher or lower off the floor as needed a great price and a good item this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly this is a pretty good stand for the price i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms i have the dr pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is bt for the price this is a good value this is definitely a sturdy and well made stand i have no fault with it about that solid materials everything snaps and latches tightly good materials works just like it s supposed to i have two complaints about it though the part that holds the music isn t as wide as other stands i probably could have read the description and realized that but i made the assumption that all stands are the same size it s just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper it will hold bigger things of course but the edges will go past the edge of the stand so it works but to me it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges the ledge is nice and wide though so it can hold some pretty thick stuff but if you are using quite wide materials especially if they are loose leaf you will want to look for a wider stand adjusting the height and tilt is difficult to alter the height one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring like one finds on microphone stands it doesn t just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands i ve encountered in life adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back which is a bit difficult to reach unlike every other music stand i ve used that one can simply force into position the good news of this is though that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring everything stays right where one puts it no slow sliding down in height no slow tilting backwards on the plus side they are sturdy and the feet can be retracted is that the word so that they are parallel to the stand making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy i love the fact that the feet do this these are excellent music stands the music stand is perfect for the keyboard i am playing it is strong height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly i bought these as back up stands and now use them all the time they perform just as good as the better stands and i liked the pack value nice this is a good product these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on i like these stands are great for my lesson business i bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight i ve had one of these for about years now i ve made s of picks out of old credit cards gift cards club cards plastic sheets plastic packaging well you get the idea this is fun and easy to do i have even sold the picks at garage sales cents each my favorite cards to use are the itunes gift cards careful cause some of the itunes cards are cardstock they most replicate a fender med pick most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med and heavy they work well also the edges do come out a little rough but i use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results the best part is i am never without a pick even when people accidentally walk off with one i do get funny looks at the stores when i ask for the used gift cards back until i explain what i do with them then the clerks are like wow thats so cool on average i can get picks from a credit card unless i m going for a particular part of the card with a design on it it takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards but seeing as they are basically free i don t mind wasting parts if i want a particular image just a word of caution on things like dvds or cds they are really too thick and tend to shatter not worth the effort i tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of punches
697	i m a beginner ukulele player and i bought one of the cheap ukulele s here on amazon it didn t sound very good and i didn t know if it was the instrument or the strings it was the strings and i m very glad i replaced them with these strings they make my ukulele sound like it should and it holds tuning pretty well i m very happy with the purchase i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence this box is small but packs a great punch i don t notice any difference in audio or loss in sound the two dials for mic and mon levels are nice and stiff and feel like they will last this personal monitor station is much smaller than i thought it would be which is definitely not a bad thing the connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality especially for only if you find you just aren t getting enough mic in your headphones grab this asap works solid looks solid and had a good price i would recommend it to anyone i really like this pop filter this was an excellent purchase beside having a great range of audio pick up the mic is so versatile great product i bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold shure sm and sm however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise these clips are in from front to back in comparison the shure clips are in to in from front to back so the shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well
698	its easy to set up and use simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it i re soak it easy weeks or so can t tell if it s truly working on my maple wood ukulele i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two sounded lovely for the first hour that s why two stars granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can t recommend personally the absolute best strings money can buy for a uke installed on a cheapo soprano they helped a lot but they won t do magic good luck i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good it is amazing what difference the strings can make i have ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings highly recommended i couldn t be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on amazon this was a newly listed item on amazon when i bought it in fact this review will be the first so i was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback but i m glad i decided on this item i wanted something with several storage compartments so i could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly this bag has six separate compartments for storage three main zipped compartments each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items perfect i also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled as well as a guitar strap that i don t currently require as i already have one but it s nice to have a spare now the padding of the bag is quite thin but firm so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying the two built in back pack straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to if you are in the market for a guitar bag and don t want to spend a fortune i would definitely recommend you consider this item it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too i like this bag though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured it s a bit too big for my tenor uke it s most probably made for a baritone uke all in all a good value for the money being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the snark sn i purchased this bargain priced tuner i could not be more pleased it has settings for chromatic bass guitar and ukulele not only does it have tone dial indicator but the screen changes color red for flat green for just right yellow for sharp the screen is also very bright and easy to read it is very sensitive no need to constantly move it around like with the snark sn it is tiny perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse i use mine for when i go to the music store and test out ukuleles this makes a perfect main tuner or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners my main tuner is a snark sn but this one is just as accurate the only negatives i can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate so you don t want to force it and the power button is very tiny but for the size and performance of the unit those low points are almost irrelevant buy a couple you can get two or three of these for the price of a single snark or korg im a huge fan of elixir s this however is my first go with the polyweb but there is no disappointment here seriously the shure sm sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged no kidding they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas you name it if it s an instrument the sm delivers i hear it s good for vocals as well when the president gives a speech the sm is there in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm the sm is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabe s for instrument sound reinforcement bar none the best everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings i ve tried several different uke strings for both my soprano and my concert ukes and i ve got to say these are not my favorites i think the sound these strings produce are overly bright a little squeaky and they don t seem to allow for smooth transitions from chord to chord in my opinion at least for the two ukes i have these strings did nothing for their tone i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings i ve got several capos from the highest end models to the cheapest and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones with ease of use and solid build quality why spend more just buy it and stop over paying for your capos forever more liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as i must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes i bought another for my step son i did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re seating the battery it has not had a problem since i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele i can t imagine life without this pick holder before i was always losing picks and then i had to strum with my fingers which i don t like doing get one of these if you play with a pick
699	this is the most awesome loop pedal ever does the trick perfect you can remove and add in elements to your loop super small only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedallike many other reviewers my gripe with the new pedals is the switch may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation defiantly a space saver i can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables it s very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits my only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much been playing for five decades now used to tune with a tuning fork then later used a boss tu for years now the snark comes along and the boss tuner reliable and true sits in the bag with other accessories i use but it has no need to come out the snake took it s place no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in fast and easy the readout is easy to see in any light working off the vibration of the string via the guitar makes this an accurate tuner as some pickups will have too great a signal for a standard tuner and give a false reading not with the snark small handy the list goes on but i think you get the point it works well very long battery life easy to see oh and did i mention accurate yeah i think i did i ve written here before that it would be nice to find a multi pedal arrangement for space saving but i still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power or another isolated power supply but it does provide clean quiet daisy chain power for up to pedals and does so pretty dang great for cheaper is it silent no is it reliable yes would i use it on stage or in the studio yes would i prefer something nicer if weren t an issue yes does this wok great on a budget absolutely if you re tired of using batteries pick this thing up if you re a super quiet signal chain snob save an extra and get the voodoo labs nice reverb can get all of the reverb sounds you want got to play with it but i got dialed in easy for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect you simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a shimmering effect it s used in subtle fashion in everything from to s s rock and surf guitar to modern indie rock but most guitarists like me were never going to shell out or more for a boss or other expensive tremolo option in fact there really weren t that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market enter the joyo jf tremolo this pedal is simple durable affordable and it just works the only two controls are for intensity depth of the volume swells and rate how fast the swells cycle the led light dims rhythmically along with the rate control which is a nice visual indicator as for the sound the pedal sounds great it doesn t color or diminish your tone in any way i m not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should if you re the type to obsess over tremolo then you probably aren t looking to save money anyway and there are boutique options from catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features i m not particularly interested in those so the lack of those on the joyo won t detract from my score regarding the quality and durability of joyo pedals there s a lot of discussion about that but also some misinformation i ve personally owned of them at one point or another yes i like them that much and i ve yet to have one fail the early run of joyo pedals is actually quite durable and includes the jf tremolo and every pedal numbered from jf through jf the more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance and while many of them still sound great they feel lighter cheaper and the switch is a little more suspect i recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the u s rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from china many of the u s vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it which is a huge advantage highly recommended
700	i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up they are indeed some high tech strings with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability plus they feel and sound good so grab a pack and get jamming you ll definitely want to check these out i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes the stock tuners have one peg these have two despite this installing them was quite easy they have a high build quality and work great i was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first but now i m glad i did this product does what it is designed to do very very well it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully the line pod hd has too much compression even with the compression effect turned off if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound then i recommend getting the boss gt and installing boss gt patches by james limborg search google for boss gt patches by james limborg i m a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves what does this add to the others well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo in other words it s freakin perfect so i d give it stars except it gets because that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius full marks you can t miss with this product you ll see much controversy about this device if you read the line forum my own opinion about this is i love it i play the guitar privately not live in public and i have no complaints at all i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday for any usable tones while playing live the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring i didn t like the recorded tones either much rather preferred amplitube if micing a real tube amp wasn t an option that being said it is good for practice and song writing used this for more than a year and finally sold it that s the other thing with items like this they lose value real quick once the next version comes out
701	i m an amateur sound tech we ve been using sm in our church for years now and our singers song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we ve had before our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this beta a because of the good reviews when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah for me it sounded better than sm my songleaders have tested it and guess what they dont want to use the sm anymore i m a professional musician and love these cables they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables i ve been using i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works it is what i expected it to be
702	i bought an ibanez concert size uke the body is inches wide less than the inches stated for this stand my uke does not fit well in the stand why the twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke thus any uke that is concert size or greater so most ukes don t fit well they fit just not well i did and you will likely need this advice remove the bottom fork turn it upside down and reinstall it no tools required now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it the fit is improved not great but better one stand can t fit all instruments but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars this small stand does not hold most all ukes although its neat how it folds up like the video here on amazon reviews it is very heavy for its size this is not a lightweight stand at all surprisingly heavy and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag trust me i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs b mini stand all hercules stuff is superb and my friend has one for his uke and says it s sublime i don t own it myself so i just present this so you can research it and it s reviews on amazon i own other herc stuff and it s all ideal and for a few bucks more i could have had that lifelong use stand instead of this one oh well for once i got cheap and got burned for it all in all not great this tiny stand one stand fits not all perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments you may think you can bend the lower forks but it s hard to do will require a vice and if you see on the amazon pictures the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves so if you splay it out like it should be you ll change the way it fits in the grooves and thus it won t work at all it s just an imperfect design my take on it your mileage may vary bye bye at the time i bought was mine arrived broken so it had gone back reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken not upset about that stuff happens it is just not a good stand light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped the protective materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft shiny runner like materail and it sticks to my instrument s neck so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity happened every time yes i tried out the stand even though broken and it proved to be a bad choice back it has gone stars to amazon s return policy thouh this is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds change the strings immediately and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too only drawback there is no volume control on the instrument itself the amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal but it s all about the instrument and i give that a this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm s it s quite a bit stronger of a microphone also i am really impressed with this mic the only thing i d like to see is that it would come with a cover bag like the shure mics do other than that you save a heck of a lot of money for the same and even better quality thanks a lot i have use this tuner for quite a few years its easy to use clip it on and go i just bought of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or mandolin the price was good see ya
703	i have one gig bag already not like this fender and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar i bought this fender is lots better then my other bag my other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this fender bag the finder s padding is a bit better than my other bag also but of course neither is as good as hard case i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg i need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar because i use crutches and they require my hands the fender s straps are great the left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty wompass and it became difficult for me to carry the straps on this fender stay put love it the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd but it can also my blueridge br or my seagull s coastal spruce either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly like i said its a great gig bag if i ever need another i ll be getting another fender gig bag i am mostly happy with this amp it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs with that said when i was shopping around for an amp both online and in person all the amps i tried and read about both very expensive and very cheap amps had one characteristic in common which is missing from this one and which i thought was universal it doesn t allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing i had to purchase a headphone amp separately wasn t expecting that this may seem a nit pick but considering the universality of this feature you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp other than that this is a great amp i could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever usually i wouldn t notice a significant difference between brands except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears but when i put d addarios on my i just couldn t believe the improvement over the martins it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else i m glad the search is over for awhile and i have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here now this is one great piece of kit two chanels watts rms real power and super control over the sound of each channel only complaint it s buh tugly sickly brown cheesy looking if she was my prom date i d put a sack over her head yeah well not that i m another george clooney or anything acoustic guitar amps have more in common with stereo systems than traditional electric guitar amps neutral full range sound rather than crunch distortion high power ratings for clean tone full range speaker system with woofer and tweeter and sensitive preamp inputs optimized for the low output of piezo pickups unfortunately for me acoustic amps tend to be optimized for steel strings and rarely get classical guitar tone right even with dial diddling as a dedicated nylon string player i m always looking for the holy grail of amps is the mini sent from heaven piezo tone i jacked in my takamine ltd classical and hirade th ss classicals with cool tubes preamps and with tone controls set flat and had my ears pinned back with shockingly powerful output the master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular unfortunately that big sound wasn t natural and sounded closer to an electric guitar than a classical big bass bright lower trebles weak mids quacky tone and compressed obviously under saddle piezo pickups are no studio mic but it should sound better than this so i diddled the controls and it improved a bit but i couldn t dial in a pleasing tone the best timbre with my hirades was bass mid and treble clock face orientation some acoustic guitar amps allow the tweeter to be disabled and i suspect the mini s overly bright tone would benefit from cutting that little guy from the circuit as a point of comparison cool tube piezo pickup tone from my year old trace elliot ta r is much more natural complex and sustained cool tube piezo tone from my shen cpk t is drop dead gorgeous perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and de piezo the tone they cost more than the mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow i plugged in my mid s trace acoustic tap preamp into the mini and was able to dial in better tone albeit still not as good as my ancient ta r i also tested my fishman aura spectrum d i and it rendered more natural classical tone so you can get decent classical guitar tone if you re willing to carry another box to your gig reverb the single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter and harsher sounding even when mixed in sparingly wish this amp had an effects loop as any budget half rack unit will sound better mic tone i don t normally use a mic for casual gigs but this is feature is handy when you need to mic a friend or blend in a small internal mic for extra ambience the mini lacks phantom power so i installed a battery in my shure condenser mic set tone controls flat and was greeted with surprisingly natural mic tone i also tried my ancient shure sm dynamic mic with similar good results albeit that mic needed a little treble cut as a point of comparison the mini whips my ta r good in terms of mic output and tone appearance build the loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures and it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my ta r if you drag it to gigs you ll find the exterior delicate the vinyl material and underlying wood are easily damaged by gentle pressure from straps and carts it s the most delicate amp i ve owned final blurb my feelings about this amp are mixed for value and use as a wee pa it s a star deal for under saddle pickup classical guitar amplification it works but is far from natural compressed dynamics bright lower highs even at full treble cut and the dreaded piezo quack so stars for classical guitar reproduction the fishman aura spectrum d i or similar acoustic guitar processor does significantly improve tone but that s another or bills unfortunately straight out of the cardboard the loudbox is not ready for for primetime nylon string reproduction i suspected the mini was optimized for steel string guitar tone so i borrowed a friend s takamine ef s and i was right steel string reproduction is significantly better than nylon string all in all the mini packs a lot of punch for bills and just may be the best buck to tone ratio deal for a novice coffee house artist
704	this is one of the cleanest sounding mini amps you ll find mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound it does sound tinny through the speaker but am radio sounded just as bad through speakers i hated it at first until i plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the o drive knob very clean but i could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar s volume knob turning the o drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp i m building a speaker cab with a jensen speaker just for this amp according to many reports it will drive a x cab so i just got this product haven t used it package looks ok strings are pakced in one plastic bagi can t wait to try this one i ve also bought martin m ghs silk and steel will come back with results i use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there it was a pain to take out too however it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar it did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall i had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole something you might want to think about before getting one of these for many years i ve been playing with proel and fender cables until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components best of all warranty for life or maybe longer let me first start off with the sizing when they say fits soundholes from they really mean it you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is smaller than the specifications i know i did my friend s oscar schmidt sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well the edges did not catch completely and it looks terrible my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole it did not fit at all you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard the main issue is the sound yes it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming slightly but enough to tell however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes for me that does not justify it a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return they resell as brand new if it looks brand new the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened does it matter in practical terms no not for this sort of item i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies this is great but i needed an actual sound hole cover i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt sound hole cover though only using it for a short time i did notice the bottom end seemed more focused awesome for accurate with tv on in the background this thing is just sweet i just love it easy no brainer put this on a gibson j it did increase the bass ok as that s not a j s strength but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have also took off a little of the finish on the sound hole when i removed it tried it on a martin d nope the bass got muddier which is definitely the wrong way to go with a martin at this point was going to return it but finally tried it on a small body now this worked great louder focused and projects much better almost resonator like fantastic for slide or capo d high that s it s home now so an o port can help a guitar that needs help a small body or cheap guitar in my sample of it made high end guitars sound worse if you can t afford a better guitar may be worth a try but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at sound hole perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike as strictly an issue of natural acoustics i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar s output and resonance i have an aria ad which is a very well made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d it can not compete with the real martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a sound canon for it s great natural volume adding the o port deadened the lows it just didn t provide any plus at all anywhere else it is however pretty inexpensive so if you re a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it s not going to break your bank but again if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person voiced it in his or her manufacturing process this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything i m an acoustic nut and i d love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box the o port seemed to corral the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole sorry to be a crab about it i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the humidipak recall a few years back but this product was a waste to me not sure if it did improve my sound or not i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldn t really tell that much maybe just a little on stage makes some very nice products this music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units well made and the price doesn t put it out of range for the everyday musician really am liking on stage products also bought of their boom mic stands and they are excellent
705	i love my hd got it a while back but have just started to explore it s capabilities sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things the possibilities are endless wonderful i love it am sure you will too enjoy i wasn t sure what to expect and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down especially when i took it from the plastic very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight because of the fumes i was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish i was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours i wouldn t leave it on anything finished for longer than that because this type of foam doesn t last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove for now it s great it comes with a black nylon sort of mesh tube shaped bag good for putting it away or traveling for now i will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn t curl so much for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable the mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance it is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat i ve been using this stuff for about years or so and i really don t play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy i purchased three of these three different colors to make a mini snake for my keyboard to their di s i typically used mogami neutrik but need cakes while in the road i usually roll my own to exact length these have worked well quiet no handling noise seem well built i treat cables well so i don t really test them with under tough circumstances and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future they are used nights a week and after uses no problems i recommend them plus for live the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well nice pieces
706	it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen the swivel ball socket broke and i had to glue the arm into the remaining socket hmmm my friend has commented on its bright color you ll never lose that thing i hope he s right cause i love this little tuner works well and easier to read than many of its competitors got these as a gift for my year old nephew he loves them the only problem is that his friends keep walking off with them this is a modeling amp it has several presets to emulate different sounds they factory settings for these are pretty good and all but the first bank of three can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp if you get the fender fuse software license comes with the amp you can get some pretty amazing pre sets from fender and other users this is not a massive cabinet so you aren t going to get that big a sound regardless but for a small room it s great common complaint i have seen no clean channel preset this is not the case there are a couple of factory presets that are clean although some people want cleaner you can either adjust the gain vol yourself or download one of several very nice very clean presets from the fender forums that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp another doesn t and is very clean even on the factory preset clean i very nearly got a different amp i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii i was sold when he showed me what all it could do then showed me the price for a mustang i for usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for it ll keep me busy for a long time one of the best tuner s out there it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order very happy with this purchase i bought it for my violin i was a bit reluctant because i uses vibrations to tune and i was hoping not to get something useless its been great so far its easy to use i clip it on my violin and tune i like to keep it on while i play to make sure i have my fingers in the correct spot as it shows the note i m playing this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag if you need some cables to connect your pedals look no farther these cables are perfect they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap what more could you ask for a strap is a strap what can you really say about it it was about with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine it s comfortable and fits my bass well i m a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it nice value i have an older version of this model but it works great i opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that i got from home depot hangers rated to hold up to lbs each equals lbs worth of peace of mind the hanger itself that i bought was used so it was already assembled so i can t comment too much on the assembly process i bought of them and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry free security and no i don t own stock in the company although im not onstage bouncing aroung they hold the strap on just fine no changing hardware like strap locks yes more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice but i will order more i ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on it s especially effective when the microphone is on my desk where my computer tower which has fans is directly under it it s not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing on top of all that it looks nice too if you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk you should definitely consider getting this along with a solid stand and a pop filter i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn accurate easy to use clear display and much smaller than i anticipated yet it s quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar at home or on the go i can t see the need for another tuner good stuff even a kid can use it with a guitar i received in a kool metallic blue but as far as i know you can t choose the color and it is bad because a match with the instrument is kool my perplexity this is why the stars is generally on electronic tuning it happened to me that different brands gave a slight different tune while all should be perfect and perfectly the same creepy isn t it what we do now i do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune better go back to the diapason it does a good job for the price i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps this pack of guitar patch cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable spaghetti mess these are well made cables with degree connectors which is exactly what we needed highly recommended cfh i have used fast fret for a number of years and think it s a great product it now comes in a metal can and has a cap over the applicator versus the old plastic can with no cap over the applicator this is a much better way to package the product and will probably help it retain the lubricant longer picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology these pick are cutting edge none better possibility created by the multi flex feature and the grip awesome these make me a better player i used to have trouble holding on to picks problem solved stress gone i own three of these and have them attached to the back of my headstocks great idea great concept and great quality only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that i have recently adopted dunlop jazz iii the dunlop max grip jazz iiis and my dava jazz picks just won t stay in there without slipping out for regular sized picks it s a perfect product for smaller sized picks i improvise by using sd card cases perfect fit for jazz picks this tuner clips on easily to all the instruments i have shows pitch quickly and accurately the screen is bright and the battery lasts a very long time it actually just dims the display as the battery is dying and can last like that for months i ve banged mine around a bit and it s stayed in one piece the plastic is solid but not unbreakable the size of the tuner is a bit large it s not the smallest on the market but it is small and light enough that when i leave it on my uke s headstock i can t feel the extra weight easy to operate easy to read i like it so much i got another one right away when i thought i d lost the first now i have two and am considering getting a third to keep in the travel bag i bought this as a second tuner for gigs it is awesome easy to use easy to see simple inexpensive get one you will not be disappointed there is a problem with the design when you move the head the little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head just break off the tuner itself is great but the product fails because it broke in minutes plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a lepai amp not much else i can tell you i ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row on a pedaltrain board it s the perfect length and the very slight bit of excess can be zip tied against the pedaltrain leaving a total stealth install since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard high quality hassle free design very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn t mar the finish or use excessive force but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing very happy with this purchase when i ordered these i wasn t expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly foot cable it turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all i plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static interference or buzz to explain the low price and all i got was a nice clean signal highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable this are some great strings i have bought them my last times and i will continue to buy them i like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar the tone is much bettter too that s why i got this i needed light without the heat it works fine just sorry it s a little pain to keep taking battery out if i want to use the ac connection other than that it s fine and pretty well constructed seems to take a few bangs without problems i have amps one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb it fails to sound right so i researched reverb pedals and found the biyang rv tri reverb to be the best in design tone and value on the market i was not wrong have had this unit for well over a month now and it still is amazing in how it produces just what was lacking with that one amp s pitiful excuse for reverb this device with it s three different reverb settings is just right for any style music you play the spring setting is really quite real in how it trails off and that doesn t happen in a digital device analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce the hall setting is wonderful rich but not too over powering the a b switch is kinda a nice touch much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer and the fact that it is stereo both in and out is just icing on the cake since it resides on my board i have grown to use it even with amps i have that are built with good reverb i m so acustom to the great sound of the biyang that i just use it for nearly every amp i own it s that good i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar it is accurate and easy to use really you hate warm sustaining natural tube overdrive you won t like it at all this is my favorite od pedal that i have i have compared it to the vox valvetone od the od side of a ehx germanium bmp a ehx linear power boost my second favorite an ibanez ts s model and a boss fender bassman fbm they all have their uses but i find the mojomojo to be the most versatile warm and punchy od i have i pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive this thing really wants to sing to you there are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers that s not to say it doesn t have some serious punchiness on the low end which it does so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups i pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and i am guessing that s why there is the voice switch the knobs pots are nice and the bass treble pots are notched at turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts the drive goes from really clean and subtle like a mild boost up to super drive territory i actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a fulltone ocd it just sounds a little more livelier to me i really like to push this pedal into the fender bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey bell like highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the fbm as a third channel of sorts and it sounds like a totally different amp stack like i said this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time i have had it i was using the ehx linear boost to perform these duties before and it performs well but the soulful tone i get from the mojomojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesn t i play mostly original compositions but i am going for the jeff beck tone and this helps me get where i want to go of course none of this means i will stop buying od pedals o i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together the glue didn t hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund warehouse deals are not such good deals i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room this does the trick just fine it is light sort of cheap etc but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg i wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home practicing it is just fine snark tuners are great they are very accurate and are very inexpensive i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now see my previous evaluation on a similar product it is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be just what i needed the display is easy to read and easier to use my old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy a definate must for any guitar player i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget i use it often but find it is not very accurate i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference i am absolutely delighted with this tunner one comment my son has one also the neck of his broke so he warned me i am always very careful when turning the head i can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen as far as tuning goes i am very pleased i moved from a guitar to a harp so i am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful plus my vision is not the best and this one i can really see very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue adhesive during installation you want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar this is the first guitar i ve bought without playing it first so i was apprehensive but it s a fine guitar it s plain to look at no decoration or embellishments but the sound is rich and full as if it were at least ten years old i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning it came with savarez strings not the best i ve used but good and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag it s strong and durable and well designed all in all i doubt i could have found a better quality product for such a low price we got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night he really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by but not too bright that it hurts his eyes a good buy i could see where this could be useful in other applications like on a music stand but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed to everyone who plays flat picking guitar i m sure you all have your own choice of pick do you even remember why you picked the style you use somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain i ve had this strap for at least a year now and it still works so well goes great with my guitar too ok so i just installed these things for my krk s no stands just sitting on two other speakers what can i say the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again my monitors sounded kinda thin before because i was losing so much energy to my desk but these things have made a ton of difference my stereo image even feels wider now sure they re a little pricy but hey they work if that s what they want to charge for them and people continue to buy them i m cool with that i m happy with the reults my got me used this to dress up the saga tele kit i bought on amazon it fit perfect and gives the fender name to a saga kit guitar don t think i ll fool anyone but what the heck excellent product at a righteous price helps my guitar stay in tune changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better great little pedal has a nice set of adjustments to give a wide range of delays and echo to your sound easy to use very low price classic sounds i wish i had ears so i could buy another one strictly home studio use haven t tried gigging with it though it seems pretty sturdy it is plastic but pretty solid plastic i also have a danelectro fab echo and this just blows it away the danelectro is okay but it just doesn t have the depth or adjustment that the berhinger pedal has this thing works great tiny and seems to be accurate the price is darn good as well a must for all guitarists this tuner is affordable and it works well i have purchased six so far they are sturdy they have all come with a battery in the box you have to install yourself i actually sat on one and thought i broke it turned out the main tuner head pops right back on to the goose neck the led is bright in low light but does not display well in bright daylight if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery the fairly large disk style battery cost me for a two pack at walgreens we had a birthday jam at a friends house i used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists at the end of the night i gave it to the birthday boy as he had admired it all night i gave one to my grand nephews i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars they stay on in their cases i like the goose neck style but i have not tried the other no neck swivel ones i also have one for my bass it s a great musician s party favor i always had trouble reading my old analog tuners in low light so i really like these tuners don t forget practice practice practice snark tuners are the best a few months ago i bought a different brand tuner and it doesn t pick up all strings i bought this one and it works great no problems i wrote a review for the sn which is essentailly the same tuner except this one also has a mic here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt clip on tuner i never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my boss the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better i bought the sn and the sn because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate the other great thing is they are chormatic so besides being a great tuner you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard the display is very easy to read better than the gogo although gogo has a new improved display since i bought mine i love the colors and the matte finish too the rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners the rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too i had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my gogo the snark is less than half the price of my gogo and out performs it it s a no brainer first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand it is now taped together while i wait for a different kind to replace it works like its supposed to no complaints at all for the price i will be buying more in the future i don t know why others rated it as a star it is exactly what it says it is and works fine this is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier the first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it this has a replaceable sponge you take it out soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container would say it gets more humidity out purchased for my epiphone electric guitar perfect has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo nice bag i really like it if you are familiar with the pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is if you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with voodoo so those bricks are will always fit keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilled the duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable if you have a power strip it won t fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug that said i have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables simple easy to use tuner awesome price works on guitars and basses i am very happy with this product very portable too people like it who am i to disagree it works well but i wish i had discovered the gibson app on my iphone before i bought but for the price it does work a lot better never clip it to any body parts only on you guitar don t ask only kidding excellent price excellent tuner with one flaw using it couldn t be simpler and it has excellent contrast i would say it was the best clip on tuner i ve had a chance to use except that it broke the first time i carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal one of the little fingers that holds the ball in the socket on the back of the tuner broke off so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces this model works only by vibration unlike the red one so without the clip it is not very useful it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it but it isn t very convenient i would just super glue it together at a good angle but i have to put it in different positions on different instruments i ve seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem so i would call it a design weakness despite the negatives i would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case update added back a star i m still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results i recently purchased a replacement the sn b but found it really disappointing so much so i may send it back i also tried a planet waves mini headstock tuner which no matter how much i try i simply cannot love so i just ordered another one of these despite the ball socket issue it is still one of the best tuners i ve ever used for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand they work great you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings i use these on an old gibson semi hollow body if you haven t used these picks get some they are the perfect size and shape your really can t beat them received these with lightining speed they came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up alot of adjustments to these and they actually adjusted high enough for me at to be able to sing at lemmy s angle great for singing micing amps and such these are each at a local music store so update these are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer s mic but if you grab it with some enthusiasm the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand i used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that i still say they are good for the price just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too these and the extra lights are great strings they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had now i m stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings they play great have nice action and tone i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great i bought one of snark s super tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised it will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio and one on my stage rig buy it it s a great little tuner i have been buying this string for many years and will continue to do so john view tips and guidelines headline more words required this is a cheap and easy upgrade at about years old my mim standard strats hardware was starting to show her age most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust for about bucks i was able to replace all the screws springs bridge neck plate this is stage one of my rebuild the tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality fold don t forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them after taking my guitar lessons i never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars my instructor told me that i need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand and to see if i could pick out some melody s without too much problem i realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work and i have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes flexibilities and strengths just go for the gusto and find what you like the planet waves instrument cables have a nice heft to them and click firmly into the amp instrument i have had no problems with them at all the attached elastic tie down that comes with these custom cables makes it easy to coil the cables for storage stars very happy holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened i m very happy with this stand it is heavy which i knew going in but for my purposes that is a plus the weight makes it more sturdy it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight adjusts easily and holds its position this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable this capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no fuss with positive micro action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose removal is simple also just press the release tab and it s ready to remove no muss no fuss it really does work that well highly recommend this bag is light with two back pack straps a pocket for accessories excellent quality material and a good quality zipper if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it if your looking for the best quality smaller practice amp this is the amp for u it s definitely high quality its got watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp definitely the best amp in this price range i would definitely recommend it i bought this strap for my taylor guitar it s a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft as it says it is made to fit well on taylor guitars but can fit in any other guitar as well the color is pretty much the same as the picture posted highly recommended this tuner works great easy to attach turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string is as easy as one two three after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was snark has a good tuner for low price thank to amazon and snark i think anyone needs a tunersnark is the best for your money there s really nothing i can add to what s already been said about this tuner i teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner i took a look at it and knew i had to have one too this tuner will tune chromatically so you don t need to buy a special tuner for that i can use it on my guitar as well as my guitarlele which is tuned a th higher than the guitar i chose it over my other chromatic tuner the night my daughter was to play guitar in her school s talent show i needed to be able to tune her guitar accurately and quickly despite all the noise in the large room it performed fantastically and so did she it s soft and rubbery feeling and won t scratch your guitar the reading are easy to read red light you re flat green you re on pitch and yellow you ve gone sharp it reads almost instantly my other chromatic clip on tuner had some trouble with the d and low e strings but this tuner seems to give me a pitch quickly i like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it the mixer arrived early which was a life saver i immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre amps were used for three vocalists and one flute and the cd input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs i am looking forward to using more of the effects i liked the fact i can insert more than picks and they really stand tight and don t fall down but the original glue was not string enought and the holder has fallen on the ground i ve used the mm and mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career i rock hard acoustic electric and bass i ve tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily dunlop s nylon picks don t break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs you ll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming maybe times in my entire career buy these picks this tuner is nice inexpensive and very easy to use it does a very nice job keeping the instrument tuned currently my favorite pick it s thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle i d recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like the snark tuner is thebest one i have owned extremely accurate easy to use very reasonably priced for such a good piecehave paid lots more for products that were harder and not as accurate i really like these strings good sound and the feel is good not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however i only bought one set not three sets and have not had to change them yet after three months this is a great little tuner used it for more than a year with no issues fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar it also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are the only reason i didn t make this a five star rating is that i discovered the planet waves pw ct ns mini headstock tuner if it was a choice between the the planet waves wins hands down but this is excellent for what it is an easy to clip on tuner that can be used on any instrument i ve even set it down on my elementary classroom autoharp and it tuned it to perfection one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune with this little gadget there is no guess work clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard what i like most is that the padded arm is thin and keeps out of the way of your playing highly recommended but what you ask this tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily mine broke and so did my friend s it s probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to get a replacement clip very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it the little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless i will try to get a replacement now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need i m new to the guitar and i m just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best for me with different guitars and different effects i like these for my acoustic ibanez dreadnaught the pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the d addario strings they are comfortable and i like the feel in my hand the mediums suit me maybe it is all personal taste but i think they are worth buying amazon pricing is great the picks feel great and i m having a good time i ve been playing for over years and now have three different electronic tuners so i m a good judge of the snark pros it s chromatic so it s good for every tuning job no need to plug it into your jack ambient noise doesn t affect it great sharp colorful display reacts quickly small enough to fit easily in my case cool blue color built in metronome powers down automatically to save the battery transposes up to four steps if you re using a capo will even identify major chords cons works better on acoustics and semi hollows than on solid bodied guitars made me realize that three of my strings need intonating or is that a pro metronome is visual only manual says that long term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars finishes big blue thing on your guitar looks weird now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners this is easier to use easier to carry around you don t have to unplug from your amp it works on acoustic or electric and it s chromatic and it s cheap definitely recommended i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic easy to use and very accurate it makes tuning a breeze this pop filter rocks i like it a lot does well compared to lots of other filters i tried it s got a nice look too i received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar this is the second one i have and it works well i have a built in tuner but the snark is so easy to use and inexpensive it is a great deal i would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player bright easy to read display adjusts to face any direction so i can even use it with my telecaster which has very little room on the headstock accurate and fast can t beat the price and battery compartment is easy to open unlike some other tuners i have the grip on these is pretty great i haven t dropped them at all and i ve been playing so much better they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings i bought one of these at a music store like years ago for bucks i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin later i saw them for here on amazon and i bought for myself for a sister and another for my brother in law these are a great deal i can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud it just uses vibration of the instrument i ve purchased many snark tuners for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use very stable and they make tuning a joy this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it they need to rethink the design but overall i like it i ll still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well i am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar but i purchased this sn to replace the piece of junk first tuner i had i m very happy with the size of the sn it s small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus it takes up very little room on the headstock and does not interfere when i make tuning adjustments the chip clip style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my ibanez acoustic and i think my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner the user interface is very simple and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions the instruction manual is adequate but the sn seemed very intuitive for me to use the product arrived on time as shown well packaged for what i believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change i ve had this sn for a couple months now and will update this review down the road thanks for reading and if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will do the best i can to answer spo my mother has a habit of stealing my picks so i always order from them they always give me good picks to use i have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar as that s what i learned on as a child i can t afford it at the moment so i decided to give these a shot these do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination i didn t expect them to but a guy can dream can t he anyway what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly bright takamine it also helped with the rather high action they play and sound softer it s almost like having a new guitar during the stringing stretching process i broke the g string go easy they are silk after all and so had to use a standard bronze replacement i asked my non music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the oddball string and she got it right on the first try that s how much of a difference these strings make they sound less metallic that may sound obvious but my point is that it s a big difference enough for her untrained ears to hear i m still saving up for a classical but i really love these strings and will be using them on my tak going forward i tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both i didn t think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp it appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner i would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet i don t know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner update the more i use this tuner the more i like it it is easy to read and use and doesn t appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was of course i am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used very nice guitar hanger easy to install and it floats away from the wall the back of the guitar never touches the wall when this arrived i didn t realize it was that small thought it has to be so its out of the way then i thought this thing can t work very well but it does perfectly the first few times a used it i wasn t expecting muchhowever i couldn t more wrong it really works well and i would recommend this to family or friends the look of this strap caught my eye i have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well the design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud strong build sort of a double layered nylon strap and nice thick leather for the ends one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new but it should be easier with some wear easy to adjust comfortable i think that with many things you get what you pay for and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get purchased this snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try for the money i figured why not great little tuner dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners this clips to the headstock and is very easy to use the face pivots around and the display is nice and bright i will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it not much to say if you play guitar buy one you ll never be out of tune again lets you tune anytime i never even take mine off no more does this sound in tune because it will always be in tune so do your self a favor and go out and buy one very affordable you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hours so enjoy i have seen people complain about battery life i turn it on tune and then turn it off and my batteries last forever the display is good and the tuners work well i have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity i think it is a well made product and good value thank god for tuners there is nothing worse than a bunch of out of tune loud guitar players at one point i had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat but then i smartened up worked my calluses to the point where i could probably play s tuned to e with no trouble and realized that these strings worked great for my strat because of the strong tone that these provide and ease of bending on the upper frets these strings also are good for les pauls where the scale length is shorter than the fender guitars making bending like velvet i ve got a bunch of these little tuners i keep one with each instrument they are a little tough on batteries but they are accurate even picking up notes below e on my double bass c extension highly recommend tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy why you would almost think i know what i am doing this was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings he found just what he needed and at a great price i ve only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well the cover is supple and easy to coil i bought this guitar in it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way i think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value this model has the cedar top i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars it is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that if you prefer the bright concert sound of a martin then you ll not want this cedar top yes this guitar has an oiled finish this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded it also allows you to knock the heck out of it funny thing is that after five years there isn t much damage just a little arm wear i think you ll like this guitar enough to not knock it around the neck feels silky smooth the frets are well placed and don t stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you ll get in other guitars in this price range paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing this doesn t come with a case so i bought a hard shell by the brand name canadian great case when i bought it it really didn t need an adjustment but i took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me i ve also taken it in every other year for setting the action checking and tweaking the neck and getting the frets polished i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago performing these tasks will prolong the life of your seagull and your enjoyment of it update update of my review this guitar sounds even better i went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic just for fun and i had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior you see i learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will open up and keep sounding better yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of it will increase in value to you at least string trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons it is lovely clear shard silk screening the capo itself is really good it is very snug on the strings this little music stand folds up small enough after some disassembly to fit in a pouch less than feet tall and inches wide once assembled it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you re standing seated on a stool or in a chair the angle of the tray is not adjustable the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location but for a portable stand it s hard to find fault with this one especially given the low cost i got this as a gift for the my guitar mentor and lead guitar player in my band i have a tuner built in to my amp i use but he has always tuned by ear which is hard to do on stage or even at rehearsal the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it i ve bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags sturdy stable and reliable not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though that s my preference but i would use no other tuner on stage i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars i have dozens of guitars i ve been using this brand of strings for years the super slinkys sound great the gauge is very easy to bend and on a good guitar will also sustain well they last a long time if you wipe down after use better yet get the big bends string cleaning wipes to increase the life of your strings like the other one star reviewers my problem is that the head broke off i tried to glue it back on but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that if you buy this you really need to baby it my advice is look for a more sturdy model i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for it is made from a very good material and i have been using this for years there are some others capo that are less expensive but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension i like this and i highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level good luck nice feeling to them they get the job done and that about sums it all up can t expect to much more from them i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont if you hate droping your pick while playing get these i have used d addario ej pb lights for years i find them hard to beat for quality and sound and will continue to use them on all my guitars much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning i can t recommend this enough and the battery last a long time i haven t had to change mine in almost two years since i ve had it just a great overall tuner i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did i am now able to play record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
707	i have had this stand for over years and still like it s compact transport capability since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping i ve used it at both inside and outside gigs without any problems i ve owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex i ve regularly rolled pound half stacks over them jumped up and down on them and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements and they stay clean and work like the first day pros proper shielding means this is a quiet accurate cable slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle very flexible metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen available in some very cool colors lifetime warrantycons none to speak of spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today a lifetime warranty means you ll have it forever bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products i even sound ok when i play his guitar so i say try em out i bought this to replace the inexpensive musedo t tuner that came bundled with my kala ka s ukulele the snark sn is much more accurate but its lcd display is not very bright and has a narrow field of view yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference i wish it were brighter and easier to see still it s a very good tuner overall the tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks it may be my imagination but i think the recent ones work a little differently than previous generations they seem to register differently than older ones and sometimes give you a tuning that is just a wee bit sharp i have used them to tune many different kinds of string instruments from autoharps to mandolins to guitars it works with all of them tuning by vibration is very useful in a loud room but it is not always perfect if another band is playing loudly the sound vibrations from the speakers will affect your ability to tune so you have to wait until the band is between songs to get an accurate reading to my taste the display on these sn s is the best of all the snarks i like the extra bars and the smoothness of the way the display zeroes in to the perfect pitch it looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes finally do not drop these the head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily it has a ball joint construction that is good and seems to hold up to use the plastic socket however on the back of the tuning head does not respond well to hitting the floor even a carpeted floor i do not treat my tuners rough but it is easy to drop them when you do out of times the plastic socket will break i have tuners whose heads are separate from the base they still tune but i have to hold them against the guitar they do not clip on any more so it is inconvenient for the price i got a little more than expected the sound is pretty great the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound other than that your can change amount of distortion its cheap and maybe it doesn t have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot but for the price this is one hell of a deal quality item only complaints are its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something but thats expected and not that big of a deal if you re careful now the one issue i really have with this pedal its cosmetic so its not worth starring this review but it did get to me the knobs they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures they are black plastic ones they look sorta bland and not as cool but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet still a great product though i bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar i have a sabine tuner with a mini mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps i d rather not go through this tuner is compact and works well i clip it onto whatever guitar i pick up for a quick tune acoustic or electric push the power button and off i go i haven t fooled with the other features metronome detuning so i can t comment about them an added comment i broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended my fault but it shouldn t have broken so easily i m sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit stronger thicker or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely this has got to be the best little tuner i ve ever owned and the cheapest too i have a tuner that works nicely but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to the sn has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn doesn t so i use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there s no place to clip it i highly recommend it this cloth works well in cleaning off the dust fingerprints oil and dirt off of my guitar it is thicker and bigger than the ones used with glasses cleaning so i m sure it can be used to wipe down other things as well easy to see easy to use easy to get used to the display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound that is what makes it so useful you can t beat the price for such a great little tuner amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience i will be buying one for every guitar case i own i bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was easy to use and handy for any string instruments only thing i regret is not getting one sooner i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well yes there many banjos and some with more frills there is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely i see no flaws on my banjo i did not have the problem with the th string machine being to tight as others i bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was bucks cheaper with free shipping if i could give it more than stars i would i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either a keeper for sure the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode the screen could be a little brighter otherwise no complaints i love these picks especially in this gauge they are a bit thinner than the jazz s so if you master em you can in theory play faster they have a good grip and a nice texture the tone it gives isn t bad either good cable doesn t tangle very good ends picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology these pick are cutting edge none better possibility created by the multi flex feature and the grip awesome these make me a better player i used to have trouble holding on to picks problem solved stress gone if you play a string instrument this one is a must i have several and a snark for each one unfortunately in the span of about two years they ve gone from about in bulk to about double that it s a good product but shop around wisely for the best price and hint read the fine print if they include a battery you ll pay lots more i even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store five stars for performance take away one for greed and another comment in i decided to buy more but went to another source which only charged one shipping price not i was shocked when i got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was for the sake of letting you know its compatibility i have used this to effectively tune an acoustic guitar an electric guitar a mandolin and a string bass that s a huge range for any tuner i ve had older versions of clip on tuners and this one just works faster and better recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges the ones made for guitar have limited range but are cheaper but i would imagine they re just as accurate i m not a huge fan of the red color it is really bulky and noticeable on all the instruments i ve had but i m happy with the trade off i just wish there was a smaller more discrete option or something in black or a more muted color although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic that was not always the case and i ve actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since when i bought my first one which was then known as a shure model unidyne iii that mic got stolen about years ago but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and i was still using it when i needed one with an on off switch function i ve owned or used countless modern day sm s and sm s along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers i have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and i don t need to get closer than about or inches to a sm to me the sm sounds similar to the shure sm studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about inches away i d only use an sm in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive by design the sm s require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the sm s i prefer the sm s over the sm s for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end the sm sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled the sm has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic i ve ever used if you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the sm if you are ever going to use an sm for vocals i d recommend buying the shure a ws windscreen with it that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm the sm will pop like mad without one the only possible drawback to the sm as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on off switch these days i can t find a modern sm with a switch anywhere however if you ve ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability for my money the sm is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes for studio vocals i d use an sm which really doesn t sound all that much different from the sm when the built in variable eq on the sm is set the way i like the sm and it s predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since and certainly the most enduring and durable you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen i purchased this to use with my old yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele it works great on both very accurate and easy to use the swiveling head works very nicely and makes it easy to see at any angle it appears sturdy and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument i haven t used other tuners of this type but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price i received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping it looks great the price is right but most of all it works wonderful very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case i bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo it works good on all of them and is very accurate i also used it to tune my uncle s mandolin for him because he couldn t find his tuner other than that theres not much else to say p i haven t used the metronome so i can t comment on that i ve been eyeing these stands for a while always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright i d spent a little money usually here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base now that i finally have one of these i m throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these hercules stands it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar the angle this leans back makes it very stable and when a guitar is hanging on it the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over it holds both electric and acoustics i haven t done any full drop tests but regardless of which guitar i put on it the stand didn t once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitar piece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars and this stand lives up to expectations and does exactly what it s meant to do this rack stand is made up of a heavy steel and welded together very well i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under minutes my audio equipment mounted easily with the included mounting screws and everything looks great and i don t have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over it is very sturdy and very stable i recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to audio or networking devices i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too i am very satisfied with my hard shell a style mandolin case i received prompt delivery it was reasonably priced and a quality product thanks this is a must have pedal for any rock player tight compressed distortion sound you could play with the eq to get the sound your looking for it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion it s build to last forever the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility s the only downside is the battery get the power adapter batteries wont last more than or days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it overall i m really happy with this pedal i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for bucks i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap also this works well with an iphone set up if you want to use some larger effects this little guy doesn t come with also this little guy doesn t gobble up volt batteries like other guitar gear tends to do the only minor flaw is it s made out of plastic so if you need something more durable maybe get a solid state amp the plugs into a wall outlet our buy two more of these they are only bucks this is a great tuner i just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since i mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars other than that works great i like using it this polish works well for what i need it for i am not a clean freak but i take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there this tuner is amazing even more so considering the price it s chromatic so it will tune anything i tune electric and acoustic guitars bass ukulele and mandolin with it i ve bought three for gifts it s great sooooo everything i said initially is still true it s a fantastic little tuner but i ve broken two of them where the clip attaches to the tuner as in a multitude of other reviews this tuner is amazing but fragile for years i ve owned a nice at recently i ve wanted to be able to double mic vocals for vocal doubling ambiance chorus effect etc but didn t have the cash for another at or similar after searching the net extensively i kept seeing the mxl rated very highly and decided to take the plunge and figured i ll just return it if it s not any good wow i can t hear any discernible difference when simultaneously recording the at on the left channel and the mxl on the right channel they both sound great and i think the mxl even looks better and feels just as solid as the at a definite keeper it s great that advancements in design and engineering are producing high quality products for the masses at rock bottom prices who says you can t afford the good stuff these days keep it up technology gurus love the snark sn works well on my bass and does a beautiful job on both acoustic and electric guitars tight tuning and easily used very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price buy it it does what a guitar tuner should do it simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that s about half price better deal if you don t just buy one and have to pay single shipping easy to use portable cheap not exact in tuning might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican for most of us this is more than adequate i wrote a review for the sn which is essentailly the same tuner except this one also has a mic here is my other review i own a few tuners including a boss tu recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt clip on tuner i never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my boss the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better i bought the sn and the sn because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate the other great thing is they are chormatic so besides being a great tuner you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard the display is very easy to read better than the gogo although gogo has a new improved display since i bought mine i love the colors and the matte finish too the rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners the rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too i had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my gogo the snark is less than half the price of my gogo and out performs it it s a no brainer these on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well i have had no problems with them great precise tuning with the sn versus the other snark versions i would only go with the sn but like all the snarks they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather and inches is fairly narrow if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect if you prefer the strap slip easily or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more then it won t be definitely top notch if this is what you are after though stars i wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin these will work for soprano the j is a good investment for under bucks they provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play increases projection and tone to any stock strings not the best not the worse strings but an improvement small size easy to transport and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy but improving guitar playing p i like the sound of this pedal it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound i have all tube amps but they are both heavy i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs the to gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank i haven t used batteries in it because i use a spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard if you rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger you won t be sorry if you re a musician there are those things that you gotta have on a regular basis and for guitar strings are one of those things i give these stars rather than just because i know there are better strings out there however these ones are great i like the sound they provide and the price is nice if you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks i said good not loud loud enough yes i suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time this is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased great color and retro style as well it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe i am still trying to get it tuning in standard but so far it s pretty accurate i know it can do standard tuning i just can t figure it out great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase i haven t read a lot of comments about these guys breaking so maybe my wife and i are just ham handed shrek wannabes but we have busted two of these little gizmos they are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument a round frisbee shaped tuner and an arm that connects the two the arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into she and i have each busted one doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floor while the tuner works well otherwise except the low e string on a bass which can be problematic and the things don t cost very much it s a shame we keep busting them i do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable just be extra careful handling them i ordered this bench for last christmas i m satisfied so far good value for money the seat is generously padded and is inches thick padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion all steel frame construction feels sturdy contrary to one of the reviews my bench came with height adjustment it is not on the fly kind of thing though each of the legs has holes low middle high a fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs and the bolt becomes the crossing point of x three positions roughly correspond to and inches for changing height all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it don t worry you don t need any tool to do the job thanks to a large plastic knob see the picture and you ll understand how it works mine initially came with middle position i also tried high and low but set it back to middle it seems to be a good compromise for my family as the bench is used daily by me my wife and my kids sure it s nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily however with this price i wouldn t complain at all tuner works great both by vibration and mic only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak mine broke off not even a year old d addario guitar strings are favourite strings they last a little longer and always sound good on my ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned sweet little neck stand very light weight folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag padded to protect guitar neck this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great so far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great nice and rubbery and feet is long enough if problems arise later with this cable i will update this review but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable sounds simply great as greasy as a pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume it changes its distortion the louder the more distorted the pignose power supply pignose ac power supply for pignose is helpful when been home but also works with aa batteries you can also amplify it s sound by connecting it to a higher watt amp it comes with really nice looking stickers i m planning to keep it for years update on review jan i admit that it might be more expensive that other watt amps but as time goes by i just fall more in love with my piggy i ve learned to use better it s own volume combined with the guitar s i have other amps of higher power that can get a lot louder that the pignose but i just love the level of distortion it gives i cannot get this crunch with the other amps no matter how much pedals bells whistles i have tried this crunch is unique and the world loves it as simple and plain as that the good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch i so much fell in love with the chords give a clean amazing sweet grumble the one that make teenage girls sigh for you with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar these stands are truly amazing they function perfectly for both acoustic and electric guitars and take up very little real estate in a room they are incredibly stable and have a nice thick cushion at the top so the guitar won t get scratched my old one lasted a long while and it still works just wanted another one these tuners are just awesome got a new tenor uke and couldn t resist putting my fav strings on it replaced ghs strings so far so good i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum these are heavy duty and well made really reasonably priced i love em stopped working all by itself fresh battery didn t help fortunately i ve another plus a korg and an two intellitouch i ve fiddles and guitars the intellitouch is simply champion a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well this case is very durable nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage the mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel the red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life for a cheap tuner this one is pretty good it s about as accurate as the snark and not as delicate the ball joint on the snark makes it prone to breakage if you re not careful packing it in a case or gigbag the display is large and bright i wouldn t use it to intonate an instrument but for quick knockaround tuning it s fine if you perform at gigs you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue this is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations i used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasn t really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around this stand does the trick beautifully nice job fender alot of zoom h users put this over their mics the fit is nearly perfect for that application this is the windscreen to get works great i ve been using national medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke decided to try the dunlop overall i m very pleased with this pick previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums this is true but isn t a complete description basically the national picks are much more elongated so while the nail to thumb pad distance is about the same on both the across nail distance is much greater on the national picks i actually find the dunlop pick to fit much better and i don t get extra overhang as with the national which tends to catch the string produce is great price and good quality it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while i play these dunlop mm picks are the right size not to big or too small been using these for years always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases they never wear out they are not too stiff or too flimsy they work good for the sound on the strings easy to hold on to this tuner is cool it picks up even the lightest vibrations i e i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out i also like the capo tuning feature you put a capo on the rd and tell the tuner to flatten x i highly recommend this tuner the design of this product is innovative and excellent i haven t used it for as long as i would generally like before writing amazon reviews of purchased items and so cannot testify to its reliability but suffice to say that for the price it would be hard to beat the display is very clear and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous i wonder how i ever lived without it before for live gigs playing electric i would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable as noisy environments probably wouldn t be ideal for this tuner this is more for your parlor acoustic setup love it fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate a must have for any musician like it better than the other tuner i bought this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again this little tuner is so easy to use and see i bought two more as presents the price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner if you don t have a tuner or are looking for a new one you need this one a my favorite string from back in the s when i had my own guitar shop great strings and the best packaging i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky very obvious calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red still i can t fault it s tuning prowess it s quick and pretty on the money it replaced my roland boss tu h well more handy for tuning my sweet la patrie nylon strung motif would buy again but i d really prefer a more subdued color the item came quickly and as decribed it clamps on my acoustic just fine no string buzz or damage to the neck so far ok i don t have much to say just i love it because its cheap nice and i don t know i just feel happy to buy this product these tuners including the red version are the best i have many tuners from expensive peterson and boss korg seiko quiktune and many other brands from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons the snark is the easiest and most stable to use even my young guitar students who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that i love have no problem tuning with this tuner this is a great tuner high quality construction the tuning is accurate the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm i liked what it did to live vocals vs an old mic i have that seemed to give everyone small shocks and probably cost way more in the day i originally bought this to check the hype out and can say that i will likely get more as needed instead of buying sm s i have not recorded with this yet but from what i heard online i think it will do just fine the mounting process was simple recommendation buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don t already have one you don t want your instrument plummeting to the floor i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers they re holding up very well the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall whether that s a good thing is up to you i guess i don t have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped so maybe it is a good thing be careful when you hang it though it could definitely hit the wall if you don t place it on the hanger carefully i must have had over tuners in the last few decades and the snark is by far my favorite i change out altered capos every few songs so i have to tweak the tuning many times each gig and this has made it much easier even in noisy clubs with poor lighting i just got the rd monitor great price got here in days so my first units have a very bright blue ish color led for power the latest one has a very mellow amber color led anyone else noticed different color led s comparing the units the newest one seems to have a differnt type feel on the impact plasctic shell weight and sound is the same i use them for everything from full band to acoustic great for vocals and guitar as stated by others not much bass response but from a in speaker what would you expect mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat my guitar doesn t fall down anymore looks nice displayed in the corner of my office very light but sturdy and is portable the only fender i ll ever be able to afford as a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal holy grail of guitar picks i am no exception dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the dollar picks you name it i ve tried it even nail picking on metal strings now if you are new to the perfect pick quest you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your grail different however if you play a light metal string acoustic my main is an aria af tenor guitar check out these dunlops nylons even within the dunlop line i have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same gage didn t acoustically perform quite the same would i try another pick if the chance was presented sure most of us would since the quest for the holy grail never truly ends but until then dunlop s nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection in my opinion this is the best amp in this category i know people who have the marshall and the fender i plugged into my little honeytone and i had the best sounding micro amp hands down they were both amazed with the sound they said well mine was only and mine was only too bad so sad for them i told them mine was since it doesn t say marshall or fender i only had to pay for a better sounding amp if you are looking for an amp with or watts and know what to expect from a micro this amp does not disappoint these strings are great they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot this is what came on my uke and i wanted to make sure i hade replacements i got both hi and lo g sets this product is straight forward and works as it s intended one side note there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings i m not sure if all of them do this but the one i received does it doesn t cause any problem with the product s performance it s just loud much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning i can t recommend this enough and the battery last a long time i haven t had to change mine in almost two years since i ve had it just a great overall tuner
708	i purchased this item sometime in august and think it s pretty good i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember pretty simple it does what it s supposed to do price is right for entry level using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings the mic mount was a plus using it for one karaoke cheap mics it is just pop riveted on so a bit loose but could improve with a little part epoxy only thing keeping it from stars still for the money a great buy this tabletop mic stand works well designed and made from descent enough materials i would buy again when i m ready to replace the one i have or add to it this is a very well built stand even with its slim design which also comes with a nice carrying case very good for light portable set ups also holds a big mic if you position the legs right completely open with the mic parallel to a leg that said do it wrong and plunk will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only paid for it would give it stars but i know user error will cause a less careful person to crash some mics good for kick drum and cab mics by the way anchor it down with a sand bag if using it for this purpose i like these pics i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin good for fast strumming etc they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto i would buy them again it was my fault not to check out it s measurements before purchase but it s not the reason why i drop by one star the reason is it s not designed properly since people stand and sing this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than feet i m i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still also it s way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a pc mic as a result i feel i m either too tall or too short build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten overall a four stars product imo this was so inexpensive i couldn t pass it up i needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactly folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag i just toss it in my gig bag and i m always ready hi guys really simple little review here this is a windscreen it does windscreen things pros it works it fits my microphonecons the package game a little smushed so it s a little misshapen it s it works if it s not the highest quality stop complaining it s what did you expect kevlar i have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for years i can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the james river i used to take my ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing the ibanez is heavy where this rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money i want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere i go when it dies i will buy another one you cannot use this for performance of any kind but for yourself friends and family around the campsite or wherever it is perfect i just got these to collect not to use to play with they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff
709	i am in agreement with others that state this is a must have i battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard this really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood i ve used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard i rub the entire neck down before and after i play it makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop which i suspect is what they must ve been using all these years and never told me though i never did ask foolish me since i ve recently gotten into doing my own setups where i ve read many forums and posters have recommended this and i figured what the heck it s less than this a great cable for practicing at home coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles this product measures approx coiled plug end to plug end thus it is pretty short even when stretched out for me it is the perfect length for at home use especially when using two amp pedal board guitar not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore i just ordered mine two weeks ago it is a fun little practice amp and i agree with the praise it gets the positives have been covered so i ll point out a few minor things i don t like first of all the power button is on the back which is annoying the rest of the controls are on top why do i have to grope around the back to find the most important button plus i keep it in a cabinet so i have to pull it out to turn it on and off next i wish they d just name the settings clean overdrive distortion and so on jc clean black panel brit combo and r fier mean nothing to me then there s another minor annoyance that the input is recessed a degree angle plug won t fit unless you run it around the back lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means it s heavy not heavy like i can t pick it up just heavy for something called a micro amp none of these are deal breakers just things i find annoying overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini good points this cable unlike many other coiled cables i ve tried does not add noise when it s moved i swung it about quite a bit while playing through it and it made no noise at all it also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end as a result the cable does not slip out too easily the connection between jack and plug is quite secure bad points the package it comes in says it s a foot cable not even close holding it up by one end with the other end simply dangling i e not plugged into anything i saw that it measures feet again that s when it s not stretched when not stretched at all it measures just feet of course this would not result in feet when it s stretched sure enough when i plugged it into an amp i could comfortably stretch it to only about feet this might not bother you it doesn t bother me since i didn t want the extra cable length but if you need anything like a foot cable you re going to have to get something else finally a minor point if you re using this on a guitar with a strat style jack this cable will be a bit but only a bit more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar no matter which end you plug into your guitar because there s not much to grip when unplugging of course if you pull on the cable itself instead of one of the ends you ll ruin it in no time overall i am quite happy with this cable and would buy more since i don t need more than the length it has and since it makes no noise i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far
710	works as described on the ipad for the price id expect a more durable product its all plastic but no moving parts to concern yourself with so it should hold up fairly well i bought this guitar nearly a year ago it was my first guitar i never cared much for the sound it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul yes it s x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat but it sounds x better if you buy a squier i think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar you ll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc or just buy a better guitar to begin with at this price point you probably won t find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss my guitar i guess but who cares i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else a question to amazon companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn t be prosecuted p s i think it is too polluting for low cost items to waste again in paper box transportation restocking work refund work and so on this is why of the time i do not ask for my money back but sell this lemon on amazon online with other websites and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith while testing nobody in irig noticed the overwhelming hisssssssing well that is beyond me works perfectly with iphone and ipad the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed my only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it but it hasn t broke yet and it might never break works perfectly with ear buds with mic controller great idea no matter how many times i hard reset my gs no success there is no problem with my jack and the phone is in pristine condition no problems until now there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work but that s about it i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box i tested the irig with an iphone and was able to get it operating i am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend s iphone but for my purposes with a gs it is a brick if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation i will re rate the product this helped me a lot building my pedal board actually think its kinda overpriced but its really really good i have of these actually i recommend this product i was very disappointed when i tried this thing i bought it so that i could play along the songs that i have on my ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted don t thing i haven t tried changing the settings on the effects amps also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables if you want to record what you play you re probably better off saving some money and buying the boss recorder or something like that being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it it sounds so horrible is unbearable update july against my better judgement i brought the slash amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better i guess the tittle of this review stands the free app sucks but if you pay for it it ll be actually useful i added two stars to the product my fav cases ever this little guy worked just as advertised it s a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont feel like bringing it it won t work the best for getting intonation right but it hits regular tuning perfectly super easy to use and a must have for anybody who gigs out this is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iphone or ipad but if you want to use it for any recording at all even demos i strongly recommend going for the irighd the hd sounds waaaaaay better and the build quality is great this guy not so much there was always a bit of noise with my old irig and it seemed to get worse over time it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy if you look you can usually find the hd somewhere for a difference is significant but the jump in quality and likely longevity of the product is definitely worth it i upgraded and would absolutely do it again i got the irig thinking i d use it for performance but he app leaves somthing to be desired i had a very hard time fining a tone i could live with plus once you add any of the virtual pedals the feedback was rediculous
711	i ve used different brands of clip on tuners to tune my classical guitars and electric basses but this tuner is the most accurate it captures the note immediately without errors whether the low e on an electric bass guitar or the high e on my classical guitar it is fast enough to use real time during intonation practice training on fretless bass it works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments takes a little getting used to but simply if the rings spin clockwise the note is sharp if the rings spin counterclockwise the note is flat if you can afford it the peterson is the best clip on tuner out there sat on my snark good tuner but takes some patience no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc would probably buy again however will also get another snark much easier for quick stage sight tuning this is my first strobe tuner so far it has been wonderful for intonation initial setups it may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure it is accurate the only thing i don t like is that the housing feels cheap like plasticy cheap it was packaged in an attractive tin which is not good for fitting in the guitar case and i wouldn t take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the go to tuner it is easy to use though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tuner update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer since i only use it for initial setups and intonations i remove the battery when i place it back in its tin there s a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful i am a believer that if you have a musical instrument it has to be out if you are going to use it regularly with these sturdy stands my guitars are out and around the house and they seem to talk to me every time that i walk by this encourages if not compulses me to pick them up and play them for minutes at a time these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well i would not recommend them for heavy on the road stage work but then again most of us are not on the road nor the tour we are just playing for the love of it i ve used d addario s on so many different guitar s the only opinion i can honestly give ya is that they are the best in the studio or on stage they stay in tune and work very well with any pickup you are using i put these on my wife s bass cause she is still learning and with a fender squire it sounds almost as good as a precision fender bass they stay true to the note so she will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time
712	i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference the nyxl s have a brighter tone good playing ease and stay in tune better when making new string changes if you have a mahogany body guitar such as the les paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies these are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are pertaining to output i am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in acoustic unamplified output but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears these do stay in tune better than my usual ernie balls nickels when you first put them on the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference i find that by lightly sanding the nut with grit paper and using big ben s nut sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other having these nyxl s on there is just one more added benefit i would say if you are looking for a brighter tone with better tuning stability these are the ones to have you can tell from the wall to wall star reviews these are the one to have we opted for the world tour guitar gig bag over a hard case because most of the time my son s guitar is hanging on the wall usingstring swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary this case is generally good quality and meets our needs with the following observations pros lightweight doesn t add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar good quality strong material stitching and zippers storage pockets big enough for music pages picks and a small electronic tuner handles good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapscons limited protection this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact appearance this is not awe inspiring to look at being very basic and the world tour logo looks a little cheesy this was a good choice for the limited light use it gets from us recommended cfh i love my mxl microphone for its versatility warmth in capturing the voice and build quality most reviews i ve read of mxl microphones have always emphasized it s clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments the mxl studio aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable in short the mxl studio has an excellent build stand microphone easy to use software and clear recording capabilities features mm condenser capsule not very big but will suit most people cardioid pattern i recommend also looking at microphones with figure and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better zero latency monitoring a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have frequency response hz khz my mxl has a hz khz the hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows output headphone jack usb audio high pass filter hz hz hz software controlled lightweight gthoughts very impressive build it s built like a rock has a very fine finish the grill and the frame around the grill are solid i was surprised at how heavy the base was it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place it s not some cheap plastic the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl multi pattern studio mic the clarity and power isn t nearly as good as the mxl but is certainly close using an usb interface a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more with usb it s a bit more set for you but that may suit some people perfectly if you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software this is a solid option easy to use plug it in via usb and you literally on your way the software installation is optional the microphone works without it windows bit detected this microphone with no hiccups summarythe mxl studio usb microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build there are certainly cheaper usb condenser microphones but not many compare to the build and durability of mxl products like this one to me the fairly luxurious price of the mxl is justified with it s excellent build clear recording and the ease of use if you re not too sure about getting this usb condenser microphone or any usb microphone for that matter i recommend getting a condenser microphone non usb and plugging that in via usb interface if you need any guidance at all with that process i m more than willing to help out cheers i occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls i m also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast and or recording audiobooks when i first opened this package i was struck how sturdy and professional looking this microphone was even the case impressed me the travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself the microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand one thing i didn t like was having reaper pushed on me i ve successfully used audacity for years and even more important it s a free program that does everything i ask of it i installed reaper and immediately disliked its interface it also repeatedly yelled at me about how if i used it past days it was going to make me pay for it i didn t like its tone so i uninstalled it mxl really should reconsider its association with reaper i tested the microphone on a phone call using google voice everyone i spoke with said the voice quality was superior to the cheaper mike i ve been using i also tested it with audacity in recording my voice again i was very happy with the results the packaging materials said that i should have received a cd in the package i looked everywhere but couldn t find it apparently i need it for something called a custom grahic user interface gui i emailed technical support and i m still waiting to hear back not cool so reaper and customer service are definite negatives but the equipment itself is outstanding this is an intriguing idea for a microphone a nice condenser with built in monitoring a possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal it seemed to me that i should test it both as a microphone and as a usb io device the very first appearance is impressive there s a nicely compartmentalized carrying case inside there s a milled aluminum desk stand a cable a short manual and the microphone no shock mount the mic looks good but has almost no mass while this may not mean much i own and have used lots of mics none of them this lacking in heft i set up a shootout in my studio i have an acoustically treated room with calibrated studio monitors so i think i can do a fair test i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles for a comparison mic i used an akg perception this is a multipattern mic that s only a little more expensive a cardiod only version is exactly the same price as this mxl i used only the cardiod pattern so i think it s a fair comparison on the basis of price to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way it was quieter with a much better midrange a glance at the specs online at mxl shows a significant boost in higher frequencies leading to about a db rise at k or so the polar pattern is shown only in broadband not at multiple frequencies and it shows a dip at the degree position these were things i could easily hear so purely as a microphone the mxl doesn t match up to other mics in its price range but that s not a complete comparison the mxl has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency that s a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses the mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable better make sure you hold still when you use it there s also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level this means that it s easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you re mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level there s also an optional software control panel mac and windows that goes with the mic it provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring i m unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it can t be undone i d apply those after the fact when i ve got plenty of time to dial them in this leaves the level controls a place where mxl could have been more careful there s a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself it takes some doing to figure out which does what there s a highpass filter tremendously useful when rumble is a problem but we don t know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain i hope it s analog but there s nothing about it in the documentation then there s the biggest problem there s a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic s headphone jack but this also means that depending on your daw it s easy to set up a feedback path you won t like that the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for a traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that i ve had for years and years only the preamp interface changes this mxl is usb only only you can t easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues most usb firewire mic preamps have a zero latency monitoring mode so the mic doesn t really offer anything you can t get elsewhere in the end i don t really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer if you re a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration it s a decent mic for spoken voice the hf boost is helpful in bringing out articulation and the single usb connection keeps your desk uncluttered of course there are plenty of other choices for that application but i think that s the best light to shine on this one
713	how much can you say about a patch cable this is a good one at a good price i recommend it trustable quiet good materials durable etc maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalb bcuz of their large plug heads but they do a perfect job with my guitar signal and honestly for me that s what i need good stuff to have i love this pedal i bought one used at gc the other day for and never looked back before it i was using a joyo vintage od that is also an excellent clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better i have it set so the level is set to low is set to high is set to and the gain is set to next tuesday i prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that it also is a nice smooth od not too crunchy for a cheap clone this is the best i have used hands down maxon ibanez ts digitech bad monkey joyo vintage od all great pedals for the money but not really sold that the maxon is times better its a must have for guitarist with multi effects it comes with a range of wires but i did not like that you camt use the last two ports together the ac ports other than that it good i put this pickguard in a mim white blonde stratocaster and guitar looks so great i didn t need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar
714	i love this guitar it has a terrific sound and it s gorgeous the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made the pockets are very handy all in all one of the best purchases i ve made for the money very happy highest quality guitar i ve ever seen in this price range it looks feels and sounds amazing a i bought two i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out this one is definitely the best i use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke you do have to find the sweet spot but once you do it works great through my pignose amp and actually fits right inside my pignose great value and price too
715	the ukulele is very cool looking it plays nice it doesn t sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele it comes with cheap strings but it s a very fun ukulele i think it s worth a hundred dollars this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound i m looking for i used to buy all shure products i m switching to gls they are just great i have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps this fits just right and looks just right it s well made and not too expensive i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps it s kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already but i can t help it i like this guitar quite simply this is a really nice guitar is it nice no but for less than nice doesn t even describe it my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing the outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problem since i d read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly nope no flaws noticeable to me kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without it other reviews had complained about a too low action but mine seems dead on of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule but even so there s really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low some mentioned rusty strings not on mine the strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well and of course the guitar sounds good again maybe not good but at least good and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price so if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar you ve found it stop wasting time just click the buy it button having bought sizes of ukulele only to discover the baritone uku is much like a classical guitars lower strings i was curious for bucks to see what it is like to play the mandolin if you are interested in this style of play search you tube videos and watch people i have not found anyone cutting hotel california out on these things i also didnt feel like i wanted to learn yet another chord set tried playing the electric guitar even going and getting rocksmith software to learn which is prety cool anyhow i changed the strings on the baritone to be a ukulele so this mandolin has a very thin neck maybe width i have watched videos of other people playing and their necks look wider this is hard to fat finger yea i have fat fingers my initial problem is this thing doesnt come delivered anywhere close to ready to go the saddle moves is not hard mounted and has height adjusters so once i figured that out and also put some in oil on the nut so when tuning the strings dont drag whether this is right or wrong i dont know i did it regardless i measured from the nut to the th fret then the th fret to the saddle and moved the saddle so both measurements were really close if you are having tuning trouble withe yours i bet this is the problem with your tuner set your strings tight that was another problem this thing should twang high pitched like the dude in the geico commericals again on you tube someone posted videos of tuning i also read buy a very stiff pick not for me i guess i am not gentle and smashed the strings couldnt keep the pick in my fingers so i use a light one the grounds for using the stiff was the pick will not bend and create delay i guess between the two strings same note the light weight one works well for me when i do pick this thing up it is not hard to tune i use my ukulele snarks and pick one string at a time it is a cute guitar regardless and i saw one for sale used at guitar center for bucks same one if you are someone who can play guitar this might be fun i suck at it i pretty much suck at ukulele playing too but manage to play rock tunes that actually sound like something i might some day figure out how to tune it like a ukulele but you can play songs with three to four chords good luck i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy now if i can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand or to the desk where i sit and play maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument yeah i think a few of these would be nice
716	easy to hold onto i m a big fan of the dunlop picks and these are great for playing live because you simply won t drop them i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room this does the trick just fine it is light sort of cheap etc but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg i wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home practicing it is just fine i also own an olympus ls this gives me the same recording ability but it is much less expensive you do get the ability to record with four channels which i am dying to try once i get my hands on encoding software also nice and not included with other brands a tripod to hold the unit a handle to use the unit like a microphone charger and earbuds some have noted the zoom doesn t have speakers built in if you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it you need monitors or quality headphones i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls this may be a big issue if you don t treat your equipment carefully time will tell but i have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money i am also looking at the zoom h which will come out in sept this product may actually be the ls killer i got these for a custom les paul string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use i had never used strap locks before and don t think i will again the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great i was expecting a so so mike for the price boy was i surprised this mike is great one thing i did notice was that if it wasn t fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing other than that it works great these strings have great tone and feel they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time i play in our band at church and as such i ve been wanting a vox ac for quite some time for those of you who do not play contemporary christian music and are wondering what the heck i m talking about let s just say that it s an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music you must utilize a vox tone because of u i know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it anyway for the past few years i ve been utilizing a line floor pod plus to achieve this tone i ve been using the class a sound which is close and quite useable but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and i ve never found a way around that i just sort of dealt with it then came father s day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used vox ac c and i love everything about it doing a little research it seems that its predecessor ac cc was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners well the ac c implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that s awesome right out of the box i ve seen some people complain about the fact that it s a pcb inside and not hand wired and that it s made in china so what it sounds very nice especially for the low price the amp s overdrive is very rich with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume i cranked it to in my living room and was quire loud for a w amp but not window shattering loud in a church setting this is obviously not an option fortunately you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy vox tone just at a more manageable level you need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the top boost and normal channels i ve opted to just use the normal channel and push it with a joyo ultimate drive pedal which by the way is the most impressive overdrive pedal you ll ever hear that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all i used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with dimarzio hs series pickups and the joyo pedal pushing the amp and it was classic vox chime all the way i also used a boss dd delay also required if you play in a christian band same reason as the other thing i mentioned pure tone heaven some have noted noise or hiss problems with this amp which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes mine did not have this problem actually i thought it did and i was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before i realized that it was the way i had the amp set up as i stated earlier this is a channel amp normal and top boost but which one you re using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into i was plugged into the normal channel and didn t realize that the top boost volume was dimed and that s where the hiss was coming from i just shut that volume completely off since i was not using the top boost channel anyway problem solved i m amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice i ve owned marshalls mesa boogies a laney a music man and other oddball tube amps over the years some costing several times the cost of the vox ac c and the vox can hold its own with those others think of it as an affordable boutique amp if you can pick one up used like i did all the better interestingly enough this amp was advertized as a used vox ac with no indication of whether it was a c or a cc fortunately it was a c it s a value at full price also get one i ll start this by saying i prefer metal slides to glass tone snob that i am so i wasn t too excited about playing with this until i played with it the tone is amazing great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics i now only use metal slides and my dunlop bottleneck
717	this capo looks great and does the job it does take a bit of pressure to open the camp but its better then the winding versions these do really well i only wish i d ordered the light s i usually buy the elizir but i thought i d give these a try i m sorry martin but i like the elixer s the best just my opinion
718	solidly built works just as a mic stand should couldnt be happier as long as i take care of this ill never need to buy a new one again i ve played string instruments for the better part of years starting with a cheap tijuana wood box as a year old progressing to martin and string acoustic guitars and a few electric fender and gibson units all good in their own respect i decided to treat myself to a les paul for my th birthday but not having the financial resources to buy a git i shopped and shopped finally settling on this cherry burst lp it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding it was even sorta in tune but a quick dial in with the electronic tuner brought that right simply put nice guitar after allowing the strings and neck to settle in together i spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height intonation and pick up distances and now this lp rocks if you re going to spend mid range on a fine practice performance guitar you can t go wrong with this one kids two thumbs up suggestion a fender mustang or amp makes this guitar sound even better the last amplifier i purchased was a fender twin valve some years ago it is difficult to use in a small apartment too loud so after giving up trying to use this with the volume at i searched for a smaller thing this amp looked suspiciously cheap and although the reviews were great still was concerned whether it would be good enough it arrived and i got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features including recording this was really a mind blowing thing the built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals and i no longer use my zoom setting it emulate a twin reverb with the effects used lightly i am amazed at both the quality of this practise amp and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck i use these cables in my home hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors they appear to be very well built and sound just fine i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly highly recommended for the price i just received this mic today and tried it out i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers this is a heavy solid high quality mic are you kidding me at this low price they giving it away heck the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and it s worth all by itself i recorded a song today with it and i sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping you can t beat this deal awesome nice mic i ordered this epi jr because i had one years ago my son adopted for his own and missed having one saw this in tv yellow and had to have it i came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website it was set up very well among the few guitars i have purchased that were playable out of the box fret work is top notch finish is good some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you ll add some of your own there was a slight binding in the nut most people think it s the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up if you can t make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue the only thing i did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream plugged in it sounds good you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region this guitar will make you a more versatile player the absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out sustain is very good as a result i could carry on forever but you get the idea i ve been a player for years and a collector for half of that i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch i have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports the quality is superb on the most recent ones tone snobs may laugh but my new epi les paul jr plays just as well as most anything out there quick snap on and off sturdy if it is not convenient it won t be used in this case it is very convenient and easy to use hence your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident well worth the money spent i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new i bought to use for my squire strat it also fit my tele to a real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig we geetarists are a funny bunch we ll change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long and spend a fortune doing it but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks case in point pure nickel strings time was when that was all there was and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled coincidence nope these things just sound better if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds if you re used to wrapped strings and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general especially if you use tubes tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs they just fit i m not nuts about fender acoustic strings but i like their normal electric strings fine though ernie ball slinkies have been my go tos for many years but these fender pure nickels are very very nice and at they re a real deal most pure nickels run nearer to ten and these sound pretty much the same and i don t seem to break many of em neither if you re used to mixed alloy pure nickels might seem a little dull but wait a bit and you ll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips try a set and see what i mean it s subtle but it s beautiful but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume i turned my modded hot rod deluxe up to call the cops levels the neighbors are getting used to it by now louder than the drummer by a good chunk and i got less squealing warmer tone by far and full chords triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string i ve ever used i think there s an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime check out bb s tone on the legendary live at the regal to hear what i mean that s the stuff so if you haven t tried pure nickels spend a buck or two more or maybe less than you normally do and give these bargain priced nickels a try you might find that you re a convert within seconds i know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up those zep and jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel and digging into some otis rush or billy gibbons licks is like night and day the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels hell of a bargain at less than five bucks the mustang was a great buy for another great fender product it has more bells and whistles than i can mention but it s sophistication is lost on me i was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the mustang it seemed that s all i was getting great little amp just not for me constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp it is not nearly as heavy as i would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together controlsthe iii comes with a button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly you can expand to add an optional button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets the controls are intuitive and easy to use it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs comparing to other amps the fender gdec does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line vox and peavy have offered in the past all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects but how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them line offers tons of sounds most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what i find with line is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little inch champ tons of character and tone you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model think the jimi blues cd the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing fender bassman wow you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end with some singing highs deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps they are all bold and in your face just play one acdc riff into the s amp and you ll recognize the sound as far as the vintage tones go i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good i was wrong the s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model this is certainly your metallica amp the metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones you can have one guy who sets all presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash it is limitless i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar they all sound very cool on this amp the classic vibe s strat really impresses me through this amp so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound i am really loving it this amp can play really really loud with it s watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes i have kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse the system is super easy to use and store on your amp as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well but you will find some gems too i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later the final wordi am a father of who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones i hate overprocessed guitar tones this amp is perfect for me perfect the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased i have a strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it there is no better modeling amp for my needs this amp is awesome its great just like it s advertised i play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the fender fuse software fender fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire the amp itself has presets as advertised are shown in different colors red green orange and you can totally customize the presets so if you want different distortions go for it another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials learn how to use it record some music but you can t save them bummer i know but it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings one last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal about the fender mustang can only use the button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses buttons or up can only be use by fender mustangs up remember this this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling the heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through but your know that they are not going to slip back out the picture does not do it justice i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal i am very impressed with how nice this strap is i had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack it never sounds thumpy or unnatural but always musical i really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like this strap is cool it is black made of nice material with gel padding and it velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros where i once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap now i feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever adds about lbs to the weight of your guitar get it if your strap isn t feeling good other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss this one is legit who say s ernie ball can t make good acoustic strings this set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itthanks amazon o i do own a few behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range and this pedal will stay in my collection i ve spent for a few of my pedals but i order and try many other pedals within the same effects range because some i believe are just to costly for what you get and the sound quality usually are not that far apart i would put this pedal in that category this is my st compressor pedal and while i dint think i really needed this type of pedal for the price i thought i would give it a try wow the behringer dc dynamics compressor pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal board plus i get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set so i can go quiet on an apartment at late hours with a watt amp that s nice so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal these are the only picks i use they re fender thins and the quality is one thing that fender has kept consistent they arrived on time and i will order them again the saddle after some minor rounding at the edges fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my takamine acoustic i haven t replaced the nut yet but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment edit i have since replaced the nut too and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one but the difference is negligible and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions this is the neatest little light i have ever seen it takes aaa batteries included but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out and has nice leds the lights are bright enough for my something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand battery life so far has been at least hours actually probably hours as my daughter has been using the light also i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable a real needed item is you play in darker rooms i could not believe the quality of this case fits my epiphone les paul like a glove very plush interior plenty of storage and very durable i got one of these here on amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp an older fender watt blackface two channel that didn t have integrated efx that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my church great little amp only had it for a couple days but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing clean tones are pristine distortion tones a bit on the transistory side but again i haven t played with the setting enough or even tried all the emulations controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on it is a bit lacking in low end to be expected from a small speaker but that is okay for practice and rehearsal it is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer depending on the style of music i did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any two settings you define have not had a chance to mess with the included software but intend to do that when i have time i like the fact that i can tweak the amp to my exact preferences and it stays in memory i only really have to do it once great feature only suggestions to fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord standard computer type and optionally the included usb cable overall for the price it is an incredible value great alternative to lugging my full rig marshall x cab racked rocktron pirhanna ada watt tube head alesis midiverb iv and some other stuff get yours while you can at this price update the fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing i now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via usb and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones the princeton amp emulation is sweet i am going to buy a second one probably the larger mustang iii cause i want the larger celestion speaker you know pretty much every fender product i have ever purchased has been first rate and this amp is no exception and i don t care if it is made in mexico my guitar is a differnt matter though
719	as far as amps that model vintage tones this is the best for my ear line vox crate digitech etc are nowhere near the fender mustang if you are comparing vintage tones i have played amps and effects from many companies as well as many of the hybrid amps that combine tube and digital tones and if you are looking for the best recreation of vintage blues rock hard rock country tones the type of tones that you get from some of the famed fender amps the mustang series is as good as you are going to do i originally bought the mustang i for my year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him i could hardly let him play the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp it is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs when you add the fender fuse to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value not to even mention the ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp the reason i love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great fender amps like the bassman deluxe reverb and twin reverb i have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well i have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy for the tube amp snobs nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp but if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the mustang will be a great practice amp for you or if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your fender tube amps weighs the mustang is a great choice i am selling my only tube amp now that i have the mustang ii because i don t gig and really need an amp that i can practice with at night while the kids are in bed for the non computer folk there is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer and if you want to give it a try it couldn t be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones for the metalheads this amp probably is not for you go try and buy a higher gain line or the vox adt series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones there are some decent metal tones to download on the fuse but the real strength of this amp is vintage tones let me make it clear i played my son s squier mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing i have a fender strat squier tele and a les paul and they all sound amazing in this amp this is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely no buyers remorse unbeatable value a great toy a perfect practice tool you can t beat it the eminence patriot cannabis rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker i ve ever heard period this does not mean that it s dull sounding or muffled at least not if you hearing is still good i hesitated quite a bit before i decided to buy it and install it in my fender mustang ii but my worries were for naught incredibly it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds yet for overdrive sounds there is very little fuzziness just a big full and fat sound that s articulate without being buzzy if you play metal you ll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy classic rock and jazzy sounds this is a speaker to seriously consider i turned my mustang ii into an open back combo and the cannabis rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed i had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps it never got shrill or piercing just buttery smooth and clear it s also much more efficient than the stock speaker at db w m i don t know how eminence did it but i love it
720	i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones they are great products but i find one thing about them absolutely infuriating the design of the ball joint that connects the tuner to the clip both of my snarks have broken off at this joint i am a home player i do not put the tuners under any type of stress this fender tuner is a great alternative the way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a snark however as others have mentioned this fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a snark so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented however for the home player this tuner will work just fine the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be it is smaller than a snark but not by much the clip works well with a prs headstock which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a strat style headstock the only real negative i see is to change the battery and to put the first battery in requires the use of a very very small phillips head screwdriver i build computers so i had one handy but i would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar i would have thought pledge would work but after a little reading i found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use it also comes with a nice polishing cloth great deal for the money i wanted this for overall practice however the only clear and good sound will be the satriani effect if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it can t still use it for practice and wont change it its just hard to get a clean sound out of it for most guitarists tremolo is a very simple effect you simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a shimmering effect it s used in subtle fashion in everything from to s s rock and surf guitar to modern indie rock but most guitarists like me were never going to shell out or more for a boss or other expensive tremolo option in fact there really weren t that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market enter the joyo jf tremolo this pedal is simple durable affordable and it just works the only two controls are for intensity depth of the volume swells and rate how fast the swells cycle the led light dims rhythmically along with the rate control which is a nice visual indicator as for the sound the pedal sounds great it doesn t color or diminish your tone in any way i m not a tremolo expert but the effect sounds as it should if you re the type to obsess over tremolo then you probably aren t looking to save money anyway and there are boutique options from catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features i m not particularly interested in those so the lack of those on the joyo won t detract from my score regarding the quality and durability of joyo pedals there s a lot of discussion about that but also some misinformation i ve personally owned of them at one point or another yes i like them that much and i ve yet to have one fail the early run of joyo pedals is actually quite durable and includes the jf tremolo and every pedal numbered from jf through jf the more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance and while many of them still sound great they feel lighter cheaper and the switch is a little more suspect i recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the u s rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from china many of the u s vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it which is a huge advantage highly recommended i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness no mud clear mids and highs with clashing mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now love it
721	it wasn t terrible for someone who was a beginner with electric guitars and amp but after a while it becomes less and less useful the strap is strong and well made the color is perfect and with the pick pocket it makes for an easy place for picks to be stored i like it a lot these guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing the colors are nice as well i would recommend these planet waves classic leather guitar strap black is good product it s soft and pretty and looks nice with my strat recommend it i m happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for good deal the fender medium is my second choice for picks my first is the just strings pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer less scrape feel on the strings at half the price pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion this was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings he found just what he needed and at a great price works well for my guitar it holds where i left it over a year ago i don t use it all that often though
722	i have a fully weighted key alesis qs and an m audio axiom semi weighted and they re both fine when i m just playing standalone or recording audio or midi but i wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing per se the alesis is perfect i can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard correctly if that makes sense it makes a clear difference to me i opted for the key strictly for space considerations and while the down up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use i often wish i d gone for a larger model to get wider voicings i may trade it in for an upgrade at some point but overall i m very happy with the keyboard received the unit plugged it into my alesis q tested it in logic pro x and it works fine the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box plugged it into the macbook pro fired up garageband and right away it s midi connectivity was intermittent then it had some stuck notes then it stopped being recognized at all it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound the jack was visibly wiggly too so you re mileage may vary but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back rather than bust it open and get soldering iron i returned it and bought an m audio oxygen for more
723	works as advertised but the keys are stiff pads take too much presure to activate nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop after the first few uses the usb socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed i had registered it with akai already so i complained to them and they sent me a new one i had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product not recommending this product first off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable there is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last for this price it is a do not recommend for me i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately i am missing out on a lot of this thing s capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what i need it for it s perfect i use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks i researched a ton before i bought this one touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys i could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my band s needs just fine this is a really amazing portable midi keyboard this is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling i ve had no problems with it and the beat pads are really firm but nice you have to use a lot of pressure on the pads but oh well it is perfect plus there are soo many settings and options to play with as well as setting the knobs on the keyboard to do whatever you need it to do works amazing in fl studio
724	small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you it tunes without any problems and i love using the word snark i thought the creaters could have implemented the clip feature i have seen on other tuners which tunes through vibrations but it still works great this capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar it does not break and is very sturdy highly recommended i m so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool i ve been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill the reason i never did was that i was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose this is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners i love it these tuners are so convienient and i have yet to see a musician i show these to who who doesn t appreciate it s simplicity what you see is what you get it s cheap it s basic and it works the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options for this price you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things better yet get one for each guitar you own they re reliable and easy to use and accurate you can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock that way they re easy to read and don t screw up the look of your guitar why no star review because they re battery eaters the provided battery lasts for about a month then starts dimming not cool a rechargeable version would be good i have one one these from the s back home and when i was looking for a new peddle i found this was still the best around i remember searching for the right peddle back in the s and going through dozens of them before settling on the rat and it s exactly the same simple sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain i run it through all manner of amps including marshalls vox and even crate both tube and transistor and with a few quick easy adjustments i get exactly what i m looking for no matter the box i m an old school player meaning i want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors this is just an enhancement to my sound and not the basis of it though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby easy to use i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background this is definitely more accurate than a person s ear while other instruments are playing my preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it but it wasn t adjustable i bought this one for its adjustability
725	i don t play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as hardwire ht polytune or korg pitchblack i researched for other alternatives and decided on a clip on tuner i narrowed it down to korg aw snark sn intelli imt all have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under i visited each manufacturers website for more information and found out about the snark sn snark claims that it s their best tuner yet if their sn can go toe to toe with the others then i would assume that their best will do even better i took the plunge and ordered one i have only requirements for a tuner it should be accurate it should be fast the snark sn delivered on both counts and more it came with other extras like tap tempo metronome super tight tuning pitch calibration transpose features etc i may not have any use for all of them right now but it s nice to have them at your fingertips you can use it for other instruments as well but i only use it for my guitars the sn is small unobtrusive the display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like after tuning i turn it off and put it back in the guitar case i don t like it hanging in my guitar of course it doesn t stay long because it tunes fast for under these little tuner is all you need fast and accurate try it you won t be disappointed this is a clone of the boss compressor and works just as well as far as i have been able to tell as the original being the owner of both i would have to say if you re not too stuck up about brands then i would go with this if you like the boss cs but many people say that bosses compressor is not that good i know some compressors do seem to be a little more natural sounding however that is just preference it does what it needs to chicken picking or just crispening up your sound its plastic but nothing is unbreakable so use some sense don t hit it with a hammer or jump on it and you ll not break it i ve had no problems with behringer but heard great things the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow great strings used them for years always loved them put them on an eric johnson strat wouldn t use anything low quality for that guitar i received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard i was assembling my plan was to try something different to compare against the boss ns noise suppressor on my other board while i love the build quality and simplicity of the one knob setup i can t say yet that i like it better than my ns with the caveat that i may not have it wired up correctly i felt that it did kill most of the excess noise but not all of it good product but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price will update this post after i play around with different arrangements and get more experience with it people say its an ocd clone it sounds very similar i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges but its a very subtle thing all in all i m happy with it knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones good pedal to add
726	open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now sounds pretty good great for the price new to guitars but in hrs it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings i ve been using hosa cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced i particularly like the right angle plug it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars that s still not a problem because i simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables i m very pleased with it and recommend it i use these pins on some of my size guitars not really sure if i can notice a difference in sound between these plastic or ebony pins that i have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal the kick mic s base is beginning to fall apart but i have used these things on the road all this brutal summer and the sound is still the same i have other more expensive mics but often use these in clubs as a backup when the drummer doesn t have a favorite or bring his own kick mic while it cannot stand up to say my favorite the d it does the job and the overheads are the easiest o h mics i have tried yet the tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece except for the kick mic mounting bracket after months of use i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics update now that i have been using them for a while i can say they are reliable durable and sound good my akg drum mic kit sees more action than the pyle s but the pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs mic ing the kick drum mic s mount is falling off but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians they are in great shape these mics have more life left and i have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point
727	i have a lot of pedals in fact i have distortion and overdrive pedals though only the mt and the od are regularly in my rig this pedal won t give you a cranked up tube stack sound no instead it s very edgy and smooth as can be it has a mid sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone i usually use it as a mid boost for solos you ll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won t be able to replicate easily i m sure the huge boss distortion box comes close but for the price with any other pedal i just got this pedal so i don t know how it will hold up over a long period of time but on first play it pleasantly surprized me it does give you some of the way out sounds other pedals my give but it does provide a gradual increase in phase as you turn the one knob mine came with a volt in it but you can also use a adapter useful tones at dollar store price good deal i m really happy with this pedal give a good phase sounds like waylon would use simple to use one knob and it doesn t boost or reduce the signal thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs the pedal responds well to the guitar s volume and easily replaces my holy fire custom badass od and every other od i have how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me just buy it this is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers i ve used it for months with no issues at all it sounds great it works perfectly and it was as for quality control i have several joyo pedals and i can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome i ve never used a phase so the clone factor was a moot point when i purchased the joyo vintage phaser it works it s simple to use and i had money left over to buy more gear i ve been playing for years and i highly recommend joyo pedals if you don t like it get a refund it s not rocket surgery
728	it does exactly what it says it does my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower but very pleased it s cheap and works like a champ a dull inept version of a tubescreamer just sounds flat and boring not very inspiring at all then again i never did really like ts s been playing for years and i have used tube screamers extensively as some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over dollars are there better tube screamer clones out there probably but for the price you will not find a better unit build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation i hate to leave this review because i know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products great pedal great value really wanted to like this one because i loved the price there is no way this is true bypass the one i got was defective out of the box and so when i checked i saw the circuitry did not support pass through maybe it is because i received a defective one but i still wouldn t try this brand name i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something i ve had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap durable and reasonably accurate i own several different tuners and what i like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it at ten dollars i think it s a no brainer it s the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own no problems with this fits my behringer dollar condenser mike just fine like it was made from the same company but it s not they must have standard fittings on mikes yep i said it better than a tubescreamer this pedal has a wider gain range far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid s screamer the only thing it seems to lack is the smooth creaminess of an old but i can easily live with that this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat i m no audiophile but this thing is just as good as my bbe green screamer it s perfect and i would suggest getting one before the cost goes up i don t know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all mighty vintage tube screamers of ibanez but it is an exact clone including the same component values potentiometers ics jrc etc for proof that it is exactly the same i was able to modify it for different frequency response corner frequency and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in ts mods of course the board is layed out a little differently the only reason i gave it really stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise hiss at higher gains but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter this gives it the characteristic mid range boost it can be cut with the tone control but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier and or a one spot power adapter if you need an clone on the cheap this is your pedal don t be fooled though it does not school the classic tube screamer but it holds its own this was a main staple on my pedalboard until i found a great deal on a bad monkey and then sadly it came off i was not looking to replace it at the time it just happened the bad money did what i needed it to do better i recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an but has the budget of your average gigging musician maxon ibanez ts joyo vintage od i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately i am missing out on a lot of this thing s capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what i need it for it s perfect i use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks i researched a ton before i bought this one touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys i could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my band s needs just fine in my opinion this thing is well worth the price gives great overdriven tube amp sound versatile for of music not for bone crushing metal the knobs work fine but do not seem to roll off or not very sensitive precise full range achieved from to noon i swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts tube screamer you wont regret this purchase awesome pedal i love the joyo pedals they don t break the bank and sound awesome glad i bought this pedal finishing a build for a customer without these would have been a real problem also used these for the tremolo back cover very handy and no digging the the parts bin for screws this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal i heard good things about the build quality but didn t end up with a biyang until i needed a reverb pedal turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal most of the popular options or and up at around the tri reverb has a distinct advantage in price but don t underestimate its quality as some other reviewers noted the reverb can get extremely deep and lush if you so desire i found myself with the blend and time knobs around for a practical spring reverb there s a multi switch for hall spring and room there are subtle differences between the three but i d be lying if i said they sounded dramatically different the a b switch isn t well explained but if you re in a mode the effect is much more dramatic i found that operating in b mode was similar to the type of reverb i had enjoyed on my amps note it has a stereo input and output but i only use one input output so i can t comment on that at the end of the day it s a fairly simple always on effect and the biyang does the job without costing a fortune but what makes it star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality having a thumb mini screw to open the v compartment instead of a plastic door or needing a phillips screwdriver is a big deal also love that the v jack is on the top of the unit away from the other jacks the pots are smooth and easy to turn and the mini switches and footswitch are boutique level quality this is a great reverb pedal i don t think i ll ever need another one i ve bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags sturdy stable and reliable not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right
729	i ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price this unit is of high quality though i wanted the version of this device with the built in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar maybe i should just change the guitar pitch to my off pitch singing and i could finally achieve perfect harmony i like everything about it especially i think it s ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life a well designed device well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack they work i bought them at dollars use for small music gigs and dj mc uses they are great for dj uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn t so important as long as you can be heard and understood i recommend for use of small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practices rehearses etc for higher quality microphones at a reasonable price look at the audix om when it s around bucks or audio technica products i buy many of these cable and they all test correctly with a meter and they all work great so far i haven t had any issues at all they feel well made and i will continue to use them for the bands pa
730	my first guitar ever i am happy with it i read great reviews here and the price seemed good it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned and the top part isn t pink like the pic also as others have mentioned it still looks pretty i did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones to minimize finger pain i ordered d addario ej d phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings extra light in a package of three sets and i like those strings better the color is nicer though the originals weren t rusty they looked new others have said their strings were rusty but mine weren t but most importantly it s easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter thinner strings i might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part i am a female and it s already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a man s especially bar chords but for now this is fine i also ordered dava grip tip guitar picks they are nice and i got a kyser string capo in gold and that works well and i got a planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system add on for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck the strap i got was a levy s with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable and i got a planet waves pro winder string winder cutter which came in handy for re stringing and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i haven t tried yet and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg guitar stand and i got a string cleaner by fender so i write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar i ll be using mine to sing with so that s why i needed a capo cause many songs i sing need a capo i use a lot of youtube tutorials to learn how to play and also find tabs chords on ultimate guitar website i can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband a music recording program that comes on mac computers and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful i am very satisfied with my purchase it came in a big rectangular box and inside that box was another one that looked like a coffin haha it made me laugh and inside that was my lovely new guitar great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the p s i don t know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue i tried this about months ago i use fender l s and with it the longevity doubles i play every day and gig one or two nights they normally go dead in a week or less i just did my rd weekend with the same set i put it on when necessary on gig breaks after practicing i wipe down the strings first with a cloth and fretboard then i put the slick on next day it s not so oily that it bothers me since i don t care for that oily feeling i just ordered more of these obviously i think it a good product update about years later i won t do without these they are part of my rig and i always have an extra at home in case it is time to change they also last quite a long time maybe months i purchased this for my son s acoustic guitar i was tired of finding it not in its case and lying on the floor or against his dresser since he got this stand his guitar has been put away on it every time the security strap is a nice feature to make sure the guitar doesn t get knocked off the stand great value for the money i was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when i was thinking about buying it but i read all the review on it and decided to give a shot i figured for the price in late nov that it wouldn t be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because i bought it to play around with while i visit my family in ca when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised the guitar came in great shape it was packed well and didn t have any damage on it the top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it but it doesn t affect the performance of the guitar it came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once i lowered the action on the guitar it was much easier to play the sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight overall i m extremely pleased with my purchase it sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much the pick guard looks a bit cheap but that s just nitpicking if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one i am extremely happy with this purchase my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning i am pleased with this product this was a precent decent product i was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great i just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets is kind of good i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit tending to sound better for more time and last longer you just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so i m not sure if it was worth the purchase but is a good product recommended finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in finally died a great pedal well made i am so in love with my pinkie i have been taking lessons using an electric acoustic guitar and i wanted to see the difference this has a thinner neck so you don t have to stretch so wide so it s easier on my hands it s actually fairly light for an electric guitar and i went with it because it s by fender and it does seem to have that fender quality for the price the only thing that i don t like is that it has a slight buzzy sound on the th string i will know better when i take the originals off but for now it wasn t a major issue i got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail saves some money on replacements i found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so i like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings i use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning i can t say much about this product i tried it twice it seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings but i really didn t notice any great change the strings didn t sound betteer or brighter now it sits in my drawer and collects dust maybe i will try it again at some point but this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard it s got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new the great part about it is the design the fact that it is wide enough to run along all six strings is a definite plus the things i don t like about it is the top does not close tight enough and can come off during any kind of travel once the top is off or just not closed properly the pad dries out and then it is useless also the little cloth that comes with it is almost impossible to fit back inside the container once you have opened it as stated it was really good at cleaning and was easy to use but i was only able to use it once because the top came off and it dried out unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item go with the fast fret for a cheap tuner this one is pretty good it s about as accurate as the snark and not as delicate the ball joint on the snark makes it prone to breakage if you re not careful packing it in a case or gigbag the display is large and bright i wouldn t use it to intonate an instrument but for quick knockaround tuning it s fine i already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw i like that one more and overall quality seems better on it even though pricing was similar when i bought the first one and the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they don t line up just right but when i put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay and that s the important part i honestly don t see the purpose it doesn t seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar i ve used it a few times but don t see the benefit edit after coming back to read the other reviews it s obvious what happened this was shipped to me completely dry there was no grease lubricant qualities it was like a dry erase pad they need to improve their quality control i m changing my rating from star to star they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn t dried out yet to place this product in a air tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out these strings are amazing they have increased power tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups the tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone i cna t say enough about them but get some for yourself i d be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings
731	this cable is built to last overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly what more could you ask for hold a tune very well and sound good the seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge but thats ok if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long but i always do and i change strings often so that isnt an issue for me overall some of the best strings available i purchased this pedal with good expectations however my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained overall the pedal sounded descent for a pedal but i could not handle the frustration i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus i am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar i got the natural finish and i am blown away at the beauty of this thing mine arrived in perfect condition will only need a minor setup the intonation was surprisingly spot on and the strings are actually alright to practice on for a while if you are looking for a great quality strat for under bucks then don t hesitate and order one of these babies jf again omfg the mk type sounds take awhile to get so tweak consider your amp settings guitar type etc the other pedals like it in the series i m intrigued by but i can get any sound i want so far with my stuff i tried both the joyo jf ultimate drive ocd clone pedals individually on strats an lp a harrington through my slightly modded vc webber speakers tube amp clean channel as with any pedal it won t make you a better player only practicing gear research use and your hands touch grip whatever you kids call it these days will have the final say of what comes out of the amp i intentionally got the jf after reading positive reviews all over the net the jf was a curiosity purchase i was able to dial in sounds of anthrax stryper stratty buddy guy blues remember he uses a metal finger tip clip at times works with pickboy metal picks the dad friendly radio rock sounds of nickelback daughtry foo fighters to get your marshall sounds takes a bit of work but i use their blues breaker ii reissue reflector and sometimes the crushing jackhammer a bbii with more options and gain i also use a digitech valve hardwire for vintage s rock or switched to saturation and mid scooped for the pantera sounds so in closing this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a boogieish sound if you know what you re doing for the sound your leaning to i have been a gigging guitarist for over years now i own all the coveted amps guitars fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town i ve used all the roland cubes that are battery powered they were just fine on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone i d read some good reviews and isnt much money i was shocked going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones but in my gig i have been using a boss me with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc looper and lastly my phone with all my backing tracks i play rythm leads and sing in my gig i connected all this to the single input of the n put volume and tone the same od turned off the sound is rich full and imho sounds just as good as my roland cube street i have all the volume i need and great tone the v battery lasts the entire hr set i am amazed by this amp
732	used this on my mandolin and it brought back the new instrument sheen it had lost months ago i sprayed it on a bit of cheesecloth used that to rub the instrument down then wiped with a soft chamois worked like a charm i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around i m just starting to learn guitar so i didn t really know much about my options i figured i had a fender guitar so i might as well get a fender gig bag little did i realize how good this one really is most gig bags don t come with all these storage pockets there s plenty of room for a few books an electronic tuner string winder strings whatever padding could always be more but that s the case with probably any soft shell bag you buy all in all i like this bag more and more since i ve discovered that all the other options in the price range aren t nearly as good i used these on my ukuleles and they worked well enough that i bought tow more pairs they hold a regular strap well and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a uke leash google it those are fabulous cheers this tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that i can t plug into a tuner banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice great product great price
733	the tuner doesn t require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it so it will work pretty well in a noisy social environment overall works just fine great little piece of leather does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar thank you this is my second and i love them so much they work flawlessley and tune is amazing get one and dont hesitate it works well with several different instruments that i have makes tuning a lot easier and accurate it is a good value i ve purchased many snark tuners for my young guitar students they are the easiest for them to use very stable and they make tuning a joy this new snark is compact and is also fast stable and easy to read my one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use i have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it they need to rethink the design but overall i like it i ll still keep my older snarks and continue to use this one as well
734	its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back very handy i just slip this into the sound hole hook it up to my amp and then when i finish playing i slip it back out this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality we purchased two of these and one arrived with some minor issues constant humming regardless of volume or eq settings amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem this is not a w stage amp nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors it has a full punch output at full gain volume and can easily light up a back yard specs input mono not a tip and ring jack controls volume gain and selectable volume eq range knobs there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector outputs mono for monitor or mixer dual mono headphone jack tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel power lighted front panel rocker switchthe box is very slim and small about a foot by a foot and deep the rear is partially open speaker exposed and allows for cord storage pros portability easy of use and set up quality finish leatherette with steel corners and good construction heavy duty lead guitar speaker excellent sound and electronics for any amp under there are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are more go with this one cons units run hot and cold as to quality but if it works out of the box it s good if not you ll know it as soon as you power it up buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldn t have any worries these amps power two squier tm by fender electric guitarssquier by fender bullet strat with tremolo bundle with strings pick card and polishing cloth black rosewood fretboardand do a great job other accessories for the beginner electric to consider cords hosa gtr guitar cable ft planet waves classic series instrument cable feetstrap planet waves polypropylene guitar strap blackstraplocks dunlop dual design straplok system nickelhanger string swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary this is my first amp which i am using with my new applause ae rrb acoustic electric guitar also purchased from amazon the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp my only complaint is that as a first time amp owner user i needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with no paperwork at all not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit i received i downloaded the users manual from the pyle website but it was also not much help but just by trying different settings i have managed to find what for me is the sweet spot for my guitar when paired with this amp very happy with the amp and also happy that i spent the extra few dollars to get the amp rather than the amp version this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers hey it s a pick it s to a bag i lost one already so now i have i my world that s good stuff
735	the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes i don t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound this cable is complete garbage never again great gig bag for acoustic guitar very well made with good padding it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps it fits the guitar nicely i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag the strap and picks were an added bonus a great value i have of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolins they attach to the wall with screws hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall it takes about a inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone rubber which protects the instrument the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again very sturdy well made product i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me it filled a hole that was missing since of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph classic side by side with the mxr there wasn t a hole lot of difference and with the behringer s added swirl switch gives you a few more options it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals i ve read a ton of reviews and still haven t heard of one breaking because of the plastic as far as value to money spent this pedal is again at the top of the list oh it also sounds great
736	its just a basick thin leather strap my only problem with it is it could be longer my bass sits to high with this strap set at its longest setting i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home i really liked the sound it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg it looked great and felt solid then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case the rattle just got worse louder as i played it was very annoying i didn t feel comfortable opening up a new amp and trying to trouble shoot it myself i had visions of voiding the warranty and being stuck with an amp i couldn t play i was sad returning the ampeg great sound for the price but i was soured on ampeg perhaps unfairly from a sample of i replaced it with a fender bronco which has an ampeg emulation setting so my bass world is back in balance admittedly since the fender bronco was more than twice as expensive as the ampeg i have thought that i could have just taken the money i spent on the fender bronco and bought a more expensive ampeg on the guess that a more expensive ampeg would have a better design or materials or quality control but a guess is just a guess and i didn t want to test that guess by throwing more money at ampeg so the fender bronco got my money my rating of stars is an average of stars for quality of sound and a star for quality of production it might just be my pickups or my strings but if you set the bass above seven or so the bass gets fairly fizzy on the e string the effects loop is useless and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals but that s good news because with this amp you don t need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive so if you ever do use a driven distorted tone you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp i was really looking forward to receiving this amp i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight unfortunately from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser like effect to the sound i tried different basses with it i tried different cables with it i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase shifter sound came out i tried all different knob and eq settings as well nothing helped so i m returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don t think less of ampeg at least not yet i really hope it s a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful for it s packed with cool features like an effects send a cd in a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice it also just looks cool and very pro my intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here i have to say buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label if there is a choice between amazon com and other vendors and even if amazon is a couple bucks more i recommend using amazon the customer service is so easy and immediate it s worth the piece of mind i ll update this review when i get the new amp later this week i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received see below
737	i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds this was my first fender amp as well the presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how it s clean sound was the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max the master volume was at and no effects were turned on i ve never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts this isn t a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond it s clearly a defect with this product dirty pre sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume you d think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy hiss at low levels wtf the next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note there s a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp file at a low bit rate and frequency whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable the weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but i m not going to be stuck playing a watt amp through my pc or cans i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted celestion speaker read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar amp related websites there s a page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and you ll find that these amps are having issues apparently the mustang i and ii don t have these issues and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesn t seem to care definitely try this before you buy it you may get an amp that doesn t have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds good this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage i am disappointed that fender hasn t yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong but i m not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong whatever i took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the built in noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and i picked up a watt marshall instead guess what the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked how about that even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noise i ll knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that i d like to try but before i buy another fender amp i ll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds i was really interested in the m and checked with the fender forum and i found that there is a problem with the m you can go to the fender forum and read about it under the mustang amp section to make the long story short some not all m m m s have what is decribed as a fizz on the clean setting when hitting the low e string sometimes it s noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible some people think it s the power supply but nobody knows for sure apparently fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a fizz problem there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz like i said i just want people to know about this before buying a m now i am considering the m which also has the fizz problem but with the the software fix released from fender there is no fizz in the m i don t know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because i didn t get the m but if i bought it i would give it a rating of stars because i don t like this fizz on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me if it didn t have this fizz i would give it a star rating i can t say enough good about this amp i have a marshall jcm which is a great tube amp but side by side this little amp really stacks up first and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp but if you want something that is close well this is it so versatile light weight and well constructed great fender quality for a great price love all the presets i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend love it i gave it five stars i purchased this for my young son but i find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does i wanted something flexible and decided to buy the mustang iii over the ii because of the power and the larger speaker i ve read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what i think about the amp it sounds great and it has loads of power since it s solid state it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end but for this price wow i have no complaints one thing most have failed to mention is the non amp features like the input for an mp player and the fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes both mac and windows are supported my son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively since he s he doesn t have many opportunities to play with others he can create jam click tracks and play along we also downloaded new firmware from fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions people who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks then upload them to fender s user web site we watched a david gilmour concert and he was inspired he wanted a tone that sounded like his we downloaded a few pink floyd tones created by other people one of them was particularly great we tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it he loves it great amp i can t compare to line but i can compare it to other amps i ve heard it s pretty nice equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of on fx as far as amps that model vintage tones this is the best for my ear line vox crate digitech etc are nowhere near the fender mustang if you are comparing vintage tones i have played amps and effects from many companies as well as many of the hybrid amps that combine tube and digital tones and if you are looking for the best recreation of vintage blues rock hard rock country tones the type of tones that you get from some of the famed fender amps the mustang series is as good as you are going to do i originally bought the mustang i for my year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him i could hardly let him play the tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp it is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs when you add the fender fuse to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value not to even mention the ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp the reason i love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great fender amps like the bassman deluxe reverb and twin reverb i have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well i have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy for the tube amp snobs nothing is going to match the sound of a really great fender tube amp but if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the mustang will be a great practice amp for you or if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your fender tube amps weighs the mustang is a great choice i am selling my only tube amp now that i have the mustang ii because i don t gig and really need an amp that i can practice with at night while the kids are in bed for the non computer folk there is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer and if you want to give it a try it couldn t be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones for the metalheads this amp probably is not for you go try and buy a higher gain line or the vox adt series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones there are some decent metal tones to download on the fuse but the real strength of this amp is vintage tones let me make it clear i played my son s squier mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing i have a fender strat squier tele and a les paul and they all sound amazing in this amp this is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely no buyers remorse unbeatable value a great toy a perfect practice tool you can t beat it
738	i got mine in a trade for practically nothing i figured i could sell it and make a few bucks saw the mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility looked like a toy to me anyway i decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little inch speaker i researched and found there is a program called fuse that can interface with the amp i downloaded and linked to the amp there i saw you can make a lot of changes that can t be done with just the knobs i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting i have the deluxe reverb reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe fender really got close with the modeling i went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between settings i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii i almost like the mustang i better but the ii does have enough power to gig with if you aren t a loud band i will leave my deluxe reverb at home for my next small gig and use the mustang maybe even the little one and mic it up my fav cases ever pretty decent sound and it s not too small for an adult to play but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm jazzy tones you can get still very satisfied these are amazing i m an intermediate player have been for the last years i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers loose grip little sweat slick finish ok now thin med heavy you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it and i can even hold onto it very nice grip on these i have to keep getting more cuz everytime i hand one to someone to try it s the last time i see it just hit add to cart you won t be sorry
739	i have used these strings since they first came out d addario make the best strings out there i am sure there are others who do a good job but you can actually hear the difference it doesn t really matter which you buy they all sound different as in better i ve read some complaints about this unit maybe those folksshould shell out an additional for something better to the rest of you with the storage units this is a great tool my band i to be exact uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track i just loaded the whole pre recorded track into a slot or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background i loadedthe effect into a slot or another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need butdon t have someone else to play it you can play it back using this device another great roland product really easy to use and well built very good sound great for practice certainly do not get the rc get this rc model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later i did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big check for sales or demos
740	this pedal work although i find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup my issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough the m does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal even running the delay on the output side of the m the noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup i run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig when using fuzz and distortion nice daisy chain if it s bought along with the spot adapter just make sure to avoid using all the connectors since it could overload the adapter and you ll have noise problems and performance issues if you use analog pedals connected as i do there won t be any problem i had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions so what i do is that i have a spot adapter connected to a power strip with my boss pedals and a wah and in the other power strip slot i have another generic adapter connected with my mxr noise clamp so it doesn t interferes with them i works just fine i use this every now and then it does seem to suck tone but it does reduce noise though i actually stopped using it and didn t hear much difference with distortion and reverb things can get a little noisy in there but the original tone with everything set up is worth it unaltered but i will keep this as it will come in handy one day i m sure i couldn t be happier with this pedal i have a les paul marshall class bb preamp ep booster analog chorus and carbon copy i used to get this annoying hum and feedback when i cranked the amp up even when i just plugged the guitar straight to the amp but those days are long gone now everything is nice and quiet i even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job i haven t noticed any difference in tone so far i was scared that the smart gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it s cheaper not to mention it has its own effects loop i don t understand how the noise supressor or the decimator could be better than this one i mean the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no warm analog delay very natural sound not sterile at all very ez to use no harsh digital bs i like this way better than the boss plus is is mxr and built like a tank to last a lifetime i recently picked up the tc electronic mojomojo overdrive at a steal of a price but i m evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price i own many different overdrives including light overdrives in the tubescreamer and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous blues driver ocd joyo ultimate drive etc to me this is closer to the tubescreamer family as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive actually the separate knobs for bass and treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the digitech bad monkey build quality outstanding it has an mxr style click button press but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last the v jack is on the top out of the way of the i o jacks the battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw button that you can easily get open with your fingers or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver the thing is dense and build solid as a rock i always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush resistant and tend to get punted around by your cables finally the knobs are built will with some force feedback and several of them are actually notched to settle into the position which is a nice touch tone quality obviously the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review i would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a and absolutely loved it as several previous reviewers did but based on the pedals i have used and my experiences with the mojomojo it feels more like a to me the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy whether the mod switch is a boost or a cut the pedal is bassier in the up position don t get me wrong i definitely appreciate the abundance of low end frequencies but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through i could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments it does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character however if you d like a similar effect with a much more expressive and brighter output try the mad professor sweet honey overdrive or its clone companion the joyo sweet baby overdrive ease of use versatility many overdrives only have the single tone control so i was excited to see controls for bass and treble still i feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps and very muddy with others i will update my review if my feelings change as i have a few different combinations i want to try out i feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer i will say that it is one of the more tube like overdrives i have tried hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone attack them harder and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup much like a tube amp however if your hope is simply to plug into the mojomojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal
741	i originally was planning on purchasing packs of xm s but after hearing the difference between the xm and the xm it was a no brainer i was looking to get vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song i really wanted sure sm s but the budget did not allow it i normally stay away from behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc but these microphones were a game changer for me they have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives also an excellent output level to the mixer i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges i was told by all singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end i do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now
742	i ve seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but i ve never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this kyser one it is by far the best i ve ever seen and i ve been using it for years now and it still works fine it makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn t corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years very highly recommended these cables are perfect the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent i really love monster cables this pedal is a great delay pedal works well with my marshall has a lot of feautures and is very versitale very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass if you don t have a pedal board with a tuner this is invaluable to quickly tune up small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case good accuracy compared to my korg pitchblack
743	smart design excellent performance what more could you want the samson meteor mic usb studio microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use with great pick up for desktop podcasts user testing screencasting and similar being a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic i had to look up what cardioid meant i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek they explain cardioid several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks some such as condenser microphones pick up a great deal of sound from several directions while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction of this latter group the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable it gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis this means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides my apologies to those pros out there who didn t need this clarification having used the samson go mic usb compact mic for a few months i was familiar with the samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the amazon vine program i had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the go mic but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the time i ve been happy with thesamson go mic compact usb microphone plug n playfor use with my desktop and laptop pcs i do a lot of usability testing for various websites and it s imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise pops hisses or similar i have to say that the samson meteor is a touch better offering clear crisp recording and reproduction it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous i like the retro styling of the meteor and the built in stand is great for desktops less portable than the samson go mic the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch the included usb cable is also of ample length for easy set up in a multitude of situations the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy much easier than using software to get the job done and an amber light makes it easy to recognize it s muted the build quality of the mic is excellent very solid high end feel you can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the front the samson meteor didn t ship with any software which while unnecessary for installation my windows and pcs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included usb but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with it another product i m reviewing the samson c ucw studio usb mic with cakewalk sonar leand the samson go mic both ship with cakewalk software the samson go mic with cakewalk music creator le and the c ucw ships with cakewalk s sonar le software so i found it kind of surprising the meteor did not at this price point for me it works out as the others have the software and they work with the meteor the included booklet includes a quick start guide for pc and mac installation how to the layout diagrams specifications polar patten frequency response and recording techniques for vocals acoustic guitar piano guitar amp and overhead drum kit the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet overall i m very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the go mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using dragon voice recognition software i have purchased an adapter to use it with my ipad so i can play with garage band and know it will be great for future screencasts my only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package which other samson products as mentioned have packaged with them i give this product out of stars i like it for this reason if samson included software it d be a star product for me super usb mic i use this when i broadcast from streetjelly com i set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal just make sure you have all your mic levels set to not clip and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic first i would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under second as a professional piano player i have never found a use for a traveling bench or stool think about it you ve got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand electric light and music perhaps even a storage case for the cables adapters extra fuses batteries tuners sometimes an extra keyboard or two or a couple of tone generators with midi cables or if you still pack a rhodes spare tines and a pair of wire cutters and you re going to add a bench to your weekly moving equipment caravan in of the locations that i ve worked i m able to locate a plain chair without arms usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players especially are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half remembered melodies to register the physical neurological effects until after the job i ve always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy not to mention prostate in fact if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded rising and lowering black steinway cushions try to replace it with a plain chair without arms especially if you re doing hour gigs sometimes two in the same day you ll notice the difference short and long term bottom line your back needs more pampering than your bottom which is why you need a seat with a back only concert artists like horowitz and rubenstein could get away with those cushy steinway stools minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement some of us aren t that lucky or gifted or smart i like everything about this mike except one no gain adjustment on the mike you have to do it from the software that was a big disappointment because i had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustment of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably won t care but if you are recording instruments particularly loud instruments you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps
744	i bought a cheep violin to decide if i would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping the peg drops really helped keep it in tune i wouldn t have been able to do it without the drops this is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use it s easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone it s easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not the only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc sounds better than any sound card i ve used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency it s a great intro model not just for ipads whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord i m so impressed my main pc audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device it s an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper beware this tuner works by guitar vibration if your playing loud with other people you ll have to ask them to stop playing so you can tune not recommended for band environments probably ok for solo gigs or home practice otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
745	i got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet construction features too well soldered trs male connections and the only downside i can complain about is the lack of strain relief but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less good cable and has m et all of our needs as all of know who use cables only time will tell whether they will last if you understand what this is for i think it s a great idea maybe not a perfect tool but i believe it does what it is supposed to and does it well keeping in mind i m a guitar player who just bought a drum kit my assumptions when using this are that drum tuning is relative meaning that of drum pitch is established by ear based on what you want each drum to sound like unlike a stringed instrument which is tuned against an absolute reference frequency and each string has a distinct relation to the others the concept with this torque key is that it assists you with applying equal tension on each of the tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all the way around the circumference of the head it by no means will help you establish as specific pitch on any drum it simply helps you achieve an even tension and relative pitch all around the head the tension numbers on the torque key are for reference only is tighter than is tighter than and so on yet these numbers are only relevant to each head i find that you don t necessarily pick a number such as and tune all the drums to that the way i use this right or wrong is that i tune an approximate tune on any given head using the traditional method of tapping around the perimeter and tightening apposing rods as necessary until the pitch is the same all the way around and at an audible frequency that i like for the drum i m tuning now theoretically you re pretty well tuned anyway but this is when i grab my torque key and i set it to a number a bit lower than were i expect the torque is this only comes from experience of using it a few times then i check a tension rod and i increase the setting on the torque key until it no longer breaks over now whatever number i m on is the reference number for that drum my process from here is to move around the head in the same crisscross pattern as you would tuning traditionally but i loosen each rod a bit first and then bring it back up to torque with the torque key after this process my drum head should both be at a pitch that i have chosen by ear and have equal pitch all around the drum head i believe it is a common practice to use a slightly different tension on the bottom side head ether a little tighter or looser than the top side typically a little lower pitch on the bottom once you ve tuned the top head and you know what number you ve used you can quickly tune the bottom by reducing or increasing a click or two on your torque key sure there are a few other variable that can come in to play like did you seat the head adequately when installing it which in essence means did you apply some light pressure to the center of the head while drawing down the tension rods in small equal amounts in a crisscross pattern also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated any variability in resistance of the threads on your torque rods will directly translate to pitch in that location again i m just a rookie and i may be off with some of these assumptions or they may have an essentially unmeasurable impact so take it for what it s worth once you find a tuning you like you could write down what number it took to achieve the pitch you like on each head that would make it easy to quickly get back to the same pitch if when your drums need to be tuned again what s most impressive isn t the top drawer leather and craftsmanship that goes without saying from levy s it s the clever design the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap adjusts to almost any position and adjusts to almost any small wireless transmitter transmitter not receiver
746	these are high quality cables both construction wise and in audio quality i use these shorter cables if i have to run bits of my rack to external amps units ie unplugging and plugging in a lot and i find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable i m satisfied i needed a new strap but i didn t want to pay for one i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot i m glad i did the strap is awesome it s very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i ve ever had it totally deserves stars i bought this guitar nearly a year ago it was my first guitar i never cared much for the sound it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul yes it s x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat but it sounds x better if you buy a squier i think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar you ll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc or just buy a better guitar to begin with at this price point you probably won t find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar if your going to use on amp get some two sided velcro and stick on amp or two sided tape etc for price its fine amazon is the best it is ok as long as you don t bump your guitar else boom it hits the floor i don t trust it and amazon has it way over priced it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place i see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts much more fun than a black box i own one of each model the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles i just got one and have used it for a few days and it s the bomb i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over this product is a rubber disc with small arms in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface and you can set your instrument against it and voila it doesn t fall over here at home i use it on the second shelf of a bookcase and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove heel on carpet neck in guitar rest i m going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases because i can use them at one of my uke parties if one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor for instance to take a whizz they re just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them here i just find a spot near wherever i m sitting and it becomes my lean spot and i can even set my beer can on the round part on the back coaster uke guitar holder it s quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument i could carry a metal stand with me but it wouldn t fit in my ukulele case this planet waves product does a winner i usually use extra lights because my fingers are wimps i like the bottom e to go down to a small i have heard though that you get more oomph bass and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings so i decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo and researched strings for it and i read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the light mediums were a happy medium and a good balance when i got my martin d m i cleaned it up and then restrung it with a set of these light mediums at first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast but that is because i am adding width to the e string to ouch i just have to build up my callouses which will take a few weeks of torture ugh but the sound is awesome part of it is the martin guitar of course but these strings when i hit the g chord ring out with a deep warm and long sustaining bass thump you feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings the th th and th the treble strings bend pretty easily no buzzing they have no coating so they squeak like hell tip i put a molecule or of hand lotion on my fingertips minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down these strings are great i recommend them i will try and update my review months from now and let you know about their longevity etc the price is great the sound is good the power jack however leaves a little to be desired my standard boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal x easier than any other pedal i ve now secured it with tape so it should be ok based on other reviews my guess is that i just got a dud and that most of them are okay this was much smaller than i thought it would be but i kinda like that because it takes up no space it does exactly what is expected of it the effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work although certainly would not replace the likes of tc electronics or lexicon relatively transparent and controls are responsive for the money good value this mic is absolutely awesome it looks and feels so high quality the sound is stunning it could be a tiny bit better for the price but i m absolutely pleased with it overall best mic in this price range by far i have used this winder now times it does what it is supposed to do and adds to speed and efficiency of the task i ve had this thing for several weeks and just now when it fell off the table for the th time i tossed it in the trash the whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber it s not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck and it s not heavy enough to stay put even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over unless you glue this thing to the table or something like that it s useless even worse than useless it s in the way addendum i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributor manufacturer at least these guys listen this is a pack of guitar strings it sounds good on my guitar and it s not that expensive i like it star rating according to amazon i would rate it stars amazon rating for stars is if you love the product if it made me sound like clapton unfortunately none of the gear that i bought can do this also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings your option to change the wah configuration is amazing only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately this can work but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table i really like this foot controller because you don t have to reach to the amp all the time to change channels i wish i had the big usb cable but i can t find it in walmart this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but it s gone now anyway this thing is nice if you re too lazy to reach to the amp to change channels i think the product should have been around i love this stuff for all my fretboards except for unusually dirty ones if it is super grundgy clean it with something stronger than follow up with this stuff leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel i usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality if you don t have something heavy on the flat end the rubber piece moves and before you know it your axe is on the ground i saw some pictures of putting a ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight but i m not so hot with that idea especially if the can is open the lip need to extend down longer and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around if i had a permanent place to mount this i d gorilla glue it down but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i ll get an extra guitar stand instead good idea but it doesn t work i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack i m not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with this rack is constructed better than i had really expected it s easy to adjust however i found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward getting he harmonica unto te spring loaded holder can be a bit tricky still this is a good deal we ve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job when i see the word microfiber i always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck this cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing i ve tried before with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it this would be great for any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions reasonably priced too i just can t trust it i thought it d be a good idea if i needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute but i just can t get myself to do it i always end up using a little fender portable stand it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp this product is worth having if like me you find yourself needing a place to quickly park your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand works great only suggestion i have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside or a way of semi permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn t move around i wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed overall i like it
747	the snark sn b super tight all instrument tuner is the best snark tuner i ve purchased of models this sn has a matte type finish not glossy it has a gun metal black look to me which i prefer to the glossy finished models the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand i purchased this instrument brand new on an impulse whim due to a managers choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore it was brand new unopened in box they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase in that environment i thought it a nice instrument however it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store and that store was very busy and noisy it s when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out this is indeed a string ukulele it measures a bit over top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range the advantage to this of course is it s string so if you re a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering that is of course until you realize that while it has strings it is not tuned like a guitar it s tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe one cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned being a total newbie to ukes this was news to me until i got it home and read the instructions so my primary purpose in purchasing this to have a small portable guitar hit a snag now that s not totally the end of the thing because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning it takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn t mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup so all is not lost there it was just an unexpected surprise mainly because i didn t research the instrument prior to purchase it s rare that i impulse buy so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument that s where the yamaha really falls short this is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box that this was a rush job out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious there are no strap pegs those will require being added by hand not difficult but extra expense and time the action is of course too high that s not unusual in truth it s quite common in off the shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here however the thing that bothers me the most if i wasn t aware this is a yamaha guitalele i d think it s was a cheap knock off child s guitar there s not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing this instrument sells for about that low cost is obvious this is a cheap guitar in every way i can t honestly say it s a toy but it reeks beginner instrument the tuners are as cheap as they come the finish is cheap there is no decoration no protective edging the finish is unfinished i bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on amazon and i respect those reviews people have different tastes and for some folks this has a home made feel that they will love however i ve been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca uh years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap i own two ovation guitars a peavey electric bass a hand made violin and an epiphone electric uke which is of such higher quality it s not even a contest and no i m not hawking epiphone facts is facts that s all you can read my very positive review on the epiphone on amazon when i got this home and took a good look at it i found no sign of quality or craftsmanship nothing that said anything more than this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible in truth the only positive thing i have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality other than those two factors one can find full size guitars all over amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality the only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke other than its portability i find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price consider it over priced or rather under made one must grant it s largely a matter of personal taste and expectation but low quality is low quality edit two weeks later i just today saw the cordoba at a local store a direct competition to this instrument the cordoba is much nicer it s built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely sorry yamaha but facts is facts had i seen the cordoba and yamaha side by side i d have bought and kept the cordoba that s my honest review i know some will disagree but others know exactly what i mean this isn t an expensive instrument so one really can t expect super fine quality at this price however i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it i simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options and frankly there are the most annoying thing about modern ideas in ukulele strings or indeed in guitar strings is to wind them with aluminum wire making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands or at worst cognitive damage skin contact with them these rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound but are silver plate wound no health problems possible from strings makes them the best
748	first of all i use this as more of a band eq using the lower and highest more for lp and hp filters the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders the box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but i tend to set and forget in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that i have been exposed to have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp eq is to enhance your tone not create it a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa your tone is made up of many many variables the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies that is the function of an eq nothing more it can range from dramatic to very subtle very small changes can have large effects small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics i am able to produce i tend to put the eq in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment if you want a little more meaty sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars this set is the ticket just slightly heavier feel but much more tone as usual after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension this is the godzilla of volume pedals it is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it it appears to be indestructible i like that it has a tuner output and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver when a friend offered to sell his for bucks i bought it without hesitation i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results if you need light maybe keep looking if you don t mind the heft you will be pleased most the reverb selection sound identical they all sound good i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better i use this pedal in my pedal chain it doesn t get much action my amp has a reverb i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones i first saw it in a big box musician s store while there was a blues guitar session going which is a public jam session open to anyone they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in i was surprised when i plugged into this amp away from that group turned it up and started playing it sounded just as good as those other amps the two employees that worked there and two other customers couldn t believe where the sound was coming from even the other players checked it out i don t understand how fender has managed to keep this amp a secret for so long poor marketing maybe i don t know but if you want a blues or blues rock amp with some great vintage tones check these out pick up a used one they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tin like has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models a couple of the marshall settings aren t bad either this amp sounds better than the super champ to my ears tried this out at the store as well which makes sense since it s a class a amp as opposed to class b warmer and more articulate the speaker is decent but this amp also sounds great using an external speaker cabinet for home jamming and recording blues without driving everyone nuts this amp is a god send check one out and you ll want it i have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig but not enough power for pedals this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for dc distribution a i m a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished i want them to be slick when i bend notes if you polish too hard or too often with steel wool it can wear down your frets these micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets i watched a youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them i think amazon had the best price comparisons i have compared side by side the following pedals fulltone mini deja vibe dunlop univibe discontinued stainless steel model dunlop roto vibe voodoo labs micro vibe bbe soul bender as well as comparing to some different beasts in the modulation family an mxr phase mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato and behringer time machine summary just the factsa great pedal and my favorite uni vibe of all doesn t take a lot of space up standard power supply good visibility on control knob settings does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise this is the only pedal in the univibe group i can say that about and it s why it s almost certainly going to be the one i keep might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others still need to play with it a little more overall i love this pedal at under bucks only downsides i see are the led does not flash the speed rate and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to toe tweak with my right foot quality seems ok but time will tell on durability pros smallish form factor although slightly larger than a boss pedal doesn t take much more room than a standard pedal standard power supply v center negative and jack on top back for easy access not in the way for patch cables on sides switchable between chorus univibe and vibrato controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking easy to see best pro is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass mids or lows it just applies the uni vibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone this is the only pedal i tested that i can say that about and most of the others cost times what this one cost led is red visible and not a weird bright laser to my retina the price at about bucks is a great deal quality of construction metal case decent knobs pots and switches no complaints so far cons led does not flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right for toe tweaking i have just had this a day so can t tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound not sure about that and i will update this review as i get time to test further but it sounds great to me overall highly recommended if you want a univibe and don t want to do a lot of comparison shopping i have done it for you some users report quality issues here i guess time will tell on that mine works fine so far and for you could buy and still save money over most other options available notes on other pedals i compared fulltone mini deja vibe highest quality construction as expected at the large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking very useful on a vibe pedal my complaint is that this vibe colors my tone it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass this probably helps the sound stand out in a mix however i d rather that my vibe not provide eq because when i switch it on or off i don t want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back my sound i was able to match exactly an authentic original uni vibe sound with some adjusting it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also i have a love hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it some days i hate it but i like the build quality and the speed control i originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn t strip the treble off my tone until i realized the mids were boosted the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag and at shouldn t be mxr dunlop m new in at about the new m uni vibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like it is second place on my list on pure sound i might even like it slightly better than the jimi and that s saying something it s the perfect form factor shape size with no significant coloration of the tone other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode the m gives the jimi a good run and if you are extremely tight on board space it might be a better choice for you they sound very similar the m has a wider range of adjustment on speed depth than the jimi but i m not sure the extra range is useful mxr jim dunlop mxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty i really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface it is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other mxr s use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as i d have to leave it with the mini switch engaged and the red led burning all the time looking like it is on when i was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch it was also a tight fit this pedal has a level knob which i m usually a fan of but i don t see the need for it on this effect i didn t care for the white main led much and of course the power supply location the led on this does pulse the speed but was annoying due to the white led that s a subjective thing i suppose all said this is a great sounding option with that perfect mxr size so a good choice but still x the cost of the jimi i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value dunlop uni vibe uv cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard to see settings placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best non standard v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick sound was very good but did also color my eq sound by boosting the bass and muffling the mids and highs slightly on the one hand this sound matched a lot of recorded uni vibe sounds i ve heard on the other hand once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix the seller had a day return policy days so i returned it and they lost the sale othewise i would still be thinking about this one i was on the fence about whether it was my winner i was able to match a true uni vibe sample but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me at i d have to love it to keep it voodoo labs micro vibe liked the form factor the simple controls high visibility knobs ability to toe tweak controls standard v power supply and placement of all jacks can get a very lush even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted and mids highs are cut the eq effect just kills the pedal for me its going back not my pick at bbe soul bender my least favorite vibe it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass in a band mix i m pretty sure it would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led it was the first vibe i bought and i only compared to fulltone and dunlop before returning it had some useable sounds but with the intensity above had an annoying womp womp womp of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion with intensity below it was usable kind of but a tone muffler i returned this one early dunlop roto vibe a good choice perhaps the only choice if you must have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment didn t color the tone much and that was a problem on most other uni vibes tested limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me intensity range seemed less than other pedals too large footprint if mounted on board but also offers the ability to take no space on the board by not mounting it i didn t like that when you switch the effect on you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in std power supply a plus led indicators good and flash the speed durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots overpriced to x in my opinion other general modulation effects univibes are effectively a phase effect without the swooshy space age edge on the sound you can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined a modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too space age sounding vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni vibe and i d recommend the behringer vibrato at if you like vibrato sounds uni vibes are normally used for their chorus setting not the vibrato setting didn t care for the behringer time machine my gear used for testing fender american deluxe stratocaster mesa mini rectifier amplifier mesa rectifier x cabinet with celestion v s pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies a note on vendor selectioni had a very bad experience with the vendor i bought my mxr dunlop m from and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product i provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page i recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal or anything else you be careful to avoid the amazon marketplace vendor called mixdspnet in san jose ca in addition to charging a restocking fee if you want to return the pedal in original condition with all materials and packaging getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with amazon to get any meaningful response once they did communicate they were very unprofessional further when the product was shipped back signature required as recommended by amazon they were not available or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product it remains unrefunded despite their confirmation that i could return the item for an refund i expect i ll need to work further with amazon in the end to get this resolved a google earth view of their addressed explained it all mixdspnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex most amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not at least when it comes to returns also while they sell a few dunlop mxr guitar pedals looking at their site reveals it s not their primary business they seem to sell a bunch of other non musical widgets my recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for to days as most large musical instrument retailers do should you need it they have a few hundred positive transactions so maybe can be ok but i can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction i ve ever had shopping on amazon the action was a little high for my taste the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible why do they sell an instrument with crap strings that is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument otherwise it s well built and works really it s a three and a half star imo it s not as nice sounding or as playable as my mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings
749	i ve been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over i ve tried thejim dunlop p dun ultex jazz iii ply pkand that was close but this is the one these davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers doesn t slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length about the same tension as s on a strat so don t want s and s too tight then s it is nice strings tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank i ve had it for over years and done many gigs and a couple tours and all my tc pedals are in perfect condition now for tone this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when i m leading worship n my band we play heavier music so i was messing around with this overdrive so i could use it there as well and i discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal it makes your tone really muddy but if you send a dirty tone overdrive or light distortion into it it screams beautifully there s some element of nostalgia with the ds that i ve just never understood i know they re cheap i know they re incredibly durable as are all boss pedals i know everybody had one or tried one at some point and kurt cobain apparently used them with his fenders but i also know that i ve almost never been happy with the tone i get when i step on the pedal it s incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way i ve used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers you can mess with the tone and dist dials all you want but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals and even on amp distortion with a richer deeper tone coincidentally i also used the boss os overdrive distortion for many years which is supposedly merges blends a ds with an od that pedal isn t ideal either but if i turn the knob all the way to distortion it s a much better tone than i ever got out of a ds then again it is very dependable and usually only or less so i can t really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone s collection that just doesn t mean you ll want to use it all the time
750	these are pretty good quality tweed cables i prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs they also make one with the degree inch input as well if you d ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you it will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat it will locate a shorted xlr or an open ground fast don t go onto the stage without one on these boxes best recorder for the money i ve seen easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings the nearest competitor to this is slightly slimmer witch to me would not be a plus because i don t use this on a camera rig the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is check out the youtube vids on it i believe it to be more versatile than its competition and the build quality is higher as well the only thing the other has on this one is its size garbage if you like it then buy it this is not how the world of music sounds too much bass and other garbage are you guys really hearing anything world has gone bass crazy since about more and more we lost analog we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp and now to put morecrap into our ears they give you onefrequency bass only take it or leave it will go find real headphones thanks kb this recorder is okay but it s far from perfect no i didn t expect it to be perfect but still i refuse to give it more than stars it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible i use this to practice with a band and then i ll just listen to the arrangement later so i can practice by myself for this much i have no complaints besides that i would never use this if i wanted a decent quality recording of anything i can t do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer fox if you haven t started in the mic collecting business trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one i ve always wondered why i can t reproduce the sounds of our local npr outlet and i finally realize it s because they have the shure sm b and i don t it enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives face it those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use it s very directional and selective rejecting room ambience and background noise so it s perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications but for announcing broadcasting vocal performance and vocal recording i don t see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it the title pretty much says it all this is such a simple great tuner the streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical great deal i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far
751	i thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it s a nice little portable amp of course you can t drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive i purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive epiphone les paul jr which fits perfectly as does a squier strat on the plus side the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some but not a lot of abuse the reason i claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear that should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this one other issue i ve had with the case is i left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges especially the lip around the top of the case again this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot enclosed space for prolonged periods for inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument it is perfect for occasional gigging but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road i would not hesitate to purchase another one if i acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because i do like the better protection this particular case provides these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best
752	like many here the case could be an inch bigger for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back now mine closes without pressure on the bridge we have my grandpa s really old mandolin now so my dad and i wanted a nice case for our year old mandolin i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work well it works just fine the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there i used to have a regular guitar strap on my bass but when i got a regular weekly bass gig and was using it more often it started to feel like the strap was digging into my shoulder your mileage may vary on that but i decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bass i read a lot of reviews and decided on this one some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable but this one was usually reviewed well it was the perfect choice this strap needs no wearing in it s supple and soft right out of the box the leather on top is smooth and classy looking and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder the wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps all of this adds up to a great deal of comfort i use dunlop strap locks on my instruments and with a thicker strap like this i had some concerns about getting them on there but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap no problem i would highly recommend this strap for any bass player or even someone with an especially heavy guitar the quality is good the smell was funny when first opened i worry about china s lack of environmental concerns but the sound is first class very quiet so with my rde nt matched pair i have a very quiet signal path
753	i am the kind of guy that fixes everything with duct tape and when the item is more tape than product i go to a pawn shop and buy something used and start the process again i saw this case and thought bucks and it s for my favorite guitar so i purchased it days later it was sitting at my back door and i didn t have to pay shipping this thing is a beauty plush interior hardware looks great and good quality does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type deep storage pocket and more my string fits in it w room to spare and its case is running out of room to tape so i guess i ll be purchasing another soon for about yrs have been playing finger style only usually with alternating bass and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice for the song i was performing chords were bm e f m and g st rd position and i needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro i found a very old and very thin peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so i then ordered the fender abalone thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy fender premium celluloid guitar picks pack abalone thinmy ancient peavey broke in half not long after and i continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new fender picks to arrive because i liked the extra flex seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings but since i never liked using a pick at all the fender thin works best for me and i m enjoying learning to use it on songs like eric clapton s interpretation of bessie smith s nobody knows you i ll try the dava picks again later if i feel the need i play simon and garfunkel s version of scarborough fair which is exclusively finger picking and george harrison s here comes the sun where he uses a pick but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle this is all on an acoustic string steel guitar using d addario ej phosphor bronze light strings bristol by blueridge bd dreadnaught acoustic guitar natural d addario ej phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings lightfor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before the fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it s not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings the grip is better on the dava but they aren t going to flex as much undoubtedly better for more accomplished players most advice i ve seen says try em all and decide for yourself i was just amazed and delighted how much easier the fender thin made it for me to get started i bought these light picks because of the price they work good if your strumming some light rhythms but they tend to be weak and break if your strumming a fast song i guess that s to be expected for a light pick i ve been using hosa cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced i particularly like the right angle plug it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars that s still not a problem because i simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables i m very pleased with it and recommend it i bought this recently for to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades for it s an awesome deal but objectively when compared to an epiphone style case i bought last year for it s deserving of stars which isn t bad just not great pros decent build quality four buckles one locking and three hinges very nice plush lining not heavy knobs on bottom so it stands on end knobs on side and back so it s never directly on the floor fits a dreadnaught well cons not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut the one locking buckle wouldn t stop anyone the big front and back body panels flex more than they should exterior covering feels somewhat cheap the handle is hard plastic and not padded so for it s a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard but it doesn t measure up to a basic epi case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes it also had a strong chemical odor but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away this is a great bag regardless of cost the fact that it sells for less than makes it an absolutely fantastic deal free shipping only makes it that much better unlike some other reviewers i have not noticed any objectionable smell i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed the fabric itself is a heavy cordura material the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your solid body guitar some very substantial protection i would estimate the padding which is entirely concealed within the cordura to be approximately three quarters of an inch thick in addition to the main carry handle at the side there is another in back at the top as well a pair of backpack style straps so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn t be any kind of an issue the two zippered accessory pouches for picks a spare set of strings and perhaps some music are also a nice touch in my opinion this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain as it is it s very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii it fits well close well protects well transport well what more can i ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases have not have it that long to rate the durability but i like this case
754	i wasn t sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since i was just starting out i bought this to work with rocksmith and it did the job just fine the guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible it turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage i put new strings on it and fixed the intonation adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar and it sounded a lot better unfortunately there s no nd fret on this guitar that probably shouldn t come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have frets but there s this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the nd fret the single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn t pick up much of that hum or else you resort to using the nd and th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum i think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too i haven t gotten that far yet i ve had it since february changed strings on it twice in months and so far it s proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on except for that nd fret oh well i am glad i bought this it is exactly what was described and it was a good price get it no strings i ve tried are like this it doesn t have a strong character but work together with your guitar my seagull now sound mellow with brightness also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it works like the picture shows hangers adjust to required width of head stock wood finish is nice look on the wall great sound quality meets full expectations cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality it s worth spending a few extra dollars on a good quality cable rather than to buy other crappy cables great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly or more picks no need to glue screw junk on your axe maybe good with slide or capo haven t tried but good product and price this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers this is a very good quality nice sounding delay you can get that classic slapback sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound very simple to operate and that s what makes these joyo pedals a joy to use nothing fancy but simple and to the point another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise they say that they are true bypass but they are not these babies are dead quiet i run mine through the effects loop on my bugera v tube amp and it sounds great i also own the joyo vintage od tubescreamer clone and it is great as well highly recommend steady and stable with the lip to hold material without slipping off when turning pages and deep enough to set my metronome on it too easily adjustable good finish solid much more stable than the folding ones just what i need this is one great piece the quality of the guitar is amazing and for its price outstanding it plays beautifully with my w amp and with my experience of guitars this is a go getter otherwise i would see this one stand out to a les paul i don t know if from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body i know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adult however for its on sale at the time even if its not i can still learn to play since thats why i bought it is to learn the pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn t really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine all togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good i am happy with it good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have comes with whammy bar thats what i know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your amp edit so now that amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that i have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit i have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
755	i have been using olympus vn for recording piano and singing sessions and i want to upgrade it to dr o mkii for stereo and connecting to computer it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices the sounds is amazing and it is much better than vn and the price is worth to spend i haven t fully utilized it yet and didn t have time to study the menu completely so i just checked the menu whatever i need at this stage so far i am happy for what i got the recording quality from this guy the build is light which is good but its plastic material is kinda cheap as most reviewer commented and the size is bulky and i think it can be shorten as dr too bad i don t need channels yet even though i can use it for guitar practices and session ended up i picked dr mkii for slightly less bought it for my x mas gift and got a promotion of rebate at that time i mailed whatever is needed for the rebate to the vendor for almost weeks but i still haven t gotten any notice from the vendor besides that the vendor requests to cut the bar code label from the original box with a filled form for the rebate which make me dislike if they don t rebate to me and i can t return it neither since the original was cut trashed feel like it s a tricky rebate i have a few shure sm s which cost more i like the open sound of the pg but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the sm s i like this mic ok but the sm is worth the extra money i think especially if you expect to push its capability what can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do i used to put my water on the stage an the time kick it over now it s right where i can find it everytime the use of the device was moderately difficult the primary difficulty was in the how the user s manual was written the information is not straight forth and the how to especially on setting up the device was severely lacking this left me to the old plug and chug method once i figured out how to set it up i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker the dr did sound better with ear buds but still was short of what i expected based on the reviews on amazon and other websites the good things though is that it is light portable and the mics can be moved i wasn t expecting bose type of sound but i wasn t expecting to hear the tin man either used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin just use a smartphone to record stuff this is a really weird not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones not really worth the i returned mine i bought this guitar in it sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way i think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value this model has the cedar top i love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars it is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that if you prefer the bright concert sound of a martin then you ll not want this cedar top yes this guitar has an oiled finish this allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded it also allows you to knock the heck out of it funny thing is that after five years there isn t much damage just a little arm wear i think you ll like this guitar enough to not knock it around the neck feels silky smooth the frets are well placed and don t stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you ll get in other guitars in this price range paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing this doesn t come with a case so i bought a hard shell by the brand name canadian great case when i bought it it really didn t need an adjustment but i took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me i ve also taken it in every other year for setting the action checking and tweaking the neck and getting the frets polished i also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in chicago performing these tasks will prolong the life of your seagull and your enjoyment of it update update of my review this guitar sounds even better i went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic just for fun and i had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior you see i learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will open up and keep sounding better yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of it will increase in value to you at least my puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable i bought this to fill the gap until i could by another name brand but since it works so reliably i ll saving my money for other things if the puppy murders this one i ll order up another one just like this i don t have any real praise or complaints about this i does just what it should and for the price it s pretty good like most pedals it can be used with a v plug in transformer but it s not included yes it s made of plastic but you can t expect any more for
756	while i ve never been a big delay guy i ve always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect i m definitely not a fan of digital delay so i did a lot of r d on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me there are basically three options out there for delays under mxr carbon copy ehx memory boy and malekko ekko i realize that there are other pedals out there but according to my research these are the best three for the price the memory boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation something i was not interesting in crazy effects are an ehx trademark so if you re looking for that sort of thing the memory boy might be up your alley i read nothing but good things about the malekko ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the carbon copy for a while and ultimately went with the carbon copy because i was able to find the most first hand reviews of it i don t regret my decision this pedal sounds great the repeats are long and do not sound artificial some people complain the repeats are too dark but i don t think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay if you re looking to recreate the edge sound analog delay is not for you i m able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track to slapstick to dreamy repeats on solos i love it sometimes i just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone one minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile at least out of the box there are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but i have yet to mess with them i would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself i was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time good though they were too expensive foronly one effect at a time returned it i decided to try out the m in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board while i haven t explored all of the sounds yet i have found some useable ones you really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation also factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much here are some that i ve personally found to be appealing so far delay analog w mod a nice sounding memory man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalreverb room standard adjustable digital delay not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicenvelope filter tron up a winner fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky synthy seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes octave bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers you will also find as expected with a multi effects pedal many unpractical downright silly sounding noise makers not to say you won t find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we re talking about a headphones session also don t depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you re using it as an addition to your amp s lead channel construction seems pretty sturdy other than the model select button which is a multi use knob with push down turn action and is cheapy cheap it s awkward and uncomfortable to use fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets having the choice between true bypass and dsp is a really nice touch and unheard of on stomp boxes as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position i do miss my korg pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually the m is serving that purpose the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package
757	i hate winding strings i got this to help with that it does it job very well you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time it could be a little tougher but as long you don t give it hell it will be fine great and cheap product i have a fender hod rod deluxe and though it s got the formel electronics mod still needed a nice touch this guy filled the need using the effects loop no need of volume or gain the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful like the name implies some very cool sounding s distortions not overbearing so your pickups and amp tone still stay in their i like the mod switch in the top left corner sounds good with my compressor infront mxr so ez to use and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank and to last awesome cord hope they make more and the world will be a better place peace and love to you all if you are looking to spend not too much on a distortion pedal in my opinion this is the one to get there are a few more different models and brands that are good but i could use this pedal no matter what style of music i m playing and not feel like i have to sell it if i start a new project my guitars largely stay at home so they don t require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case hard cases almost always cost dollars or more and also take up about twice as much room which is problematic for storing multiple instruments in most cases a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs and costs about of the price of a hard case i bought two different variations of the fender gig bag and i believe the one pictured here is the one that has fender medium guitar picks as zipper handles which is a cool touch the case fits my fender squier strat guitars or other guitars of a similar size snugly there is not a ton of padding but more than you might think from the pictures especially on top the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps i can t say that the zippers will withstand years of use but for most uses they should do just fine glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars
758	the joyo ultimate overdrive is simply a great pedal tone adjustment is precise the bright switch is an added bonus having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal construction is first rate and there is absolutly no hum hiss loss of signal nor any excessive coloring of your signal in short you get drive that has a very broad range to work from through a tube amp it just extends the sound to levels that were not possible using the amp s gain alone impressive i can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good it just is i m not one to argue over perfection and neither should anyone else that plays guitar and cares about their tone and gear this one is a winner hands down and i m not a new player either been at it for nearly decades now i know tone and have had great and not so great gear this one is a keeper it handles everything from easy overdrive to nearly all out metal not a metal pedal though but it gets that drive from those huge amps of the s right on the money versatile smooth easy to dial in what s not to like here forget your boutique pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal i ve used d addario strings for a long time been playing yrs and have always been satisfied with their tone the balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension do i fully understand how this works nope but they sure do sound good their feel is a little more snappy than regular xl s in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well their sound is bright just like their xl cousins i think it s more of a feel thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instruments all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist it is built like a tank but it quit working after a couple of weeks i haven t made time trouble shoot it yet so i m not sure what component has failed pretty cool knock off of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo this is my nd or rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far i don t care for the cheap jacks but you get what you pay for and i can always replace them if they break i work on pedals all the time i ve got a scratchbuilt improved ea trem with two footswitchable speeds and a cheap little danelectro tuna melt other than the crummy bypass and plastic construction the tuna melt is my favorite since it has the hard soft switch the improved ea has a great preamp for guaranteed unity gain or more and the footswitchable speeds that i added gives it extra flexibility but i think the joyo trumps it by just a little bit in that the core trem sound is a nice blend of the tuna melt s hard and soft settings so part of this is really a subjective take on this flavor of trem but suffice it to say if you ve tried a few this one will probably satisfy you at least a bit no unity gain issues and the speed and depth have a good sweep throughout their ranges and it s just a niggle but how hard would it be to get the word tremolo silkscreened so that it s centered on the box at least there s no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion if you re looking for the perfect patch cables for your effects board these are it very well manufactured durable and reliable i ll use these again and again hosa patch cables are the best for the buck great sound and flexible i m a firm hosa cable fan love these little guys i picked up this pedal used along with ds keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think long story short the mod ds is getting returned and i m keeping my fulltone ocd first a word about the negative reviews it tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something but the other reviews as of sept were all star reviews it tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didn t know what the pedal was before they tried it and anyone complaining about the price this is a hand crafted pedal that is extremely well constructed the inside circuitry is pristine and built to last for decades i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost now let s talk about how the pedal sounds it s marketed as an overdrive distortion i had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because i indicated i was looking for a distortion pedal but i was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has it is much more an overdrive in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp but boosts the level in gain in a very full rich sound the sound has a lot of bass to it but unlike a tubescreamer ts it s definitely not muddy in fact if you re tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act this might be exactly what you need the battery is accessible behind hand screws and moderately involved to get to but an ac adapter is really the way to go it s a standard plug like you find on boss and ibanez pedals but you can use a v or v i ve read some reviewers say that v gives you more headroom while some actually prefer the v sound honestly i tried both and didn t discern any difference it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinets finally there is an lp hp switch and it s really a matter of preference and setup how you use it i ve been mostly using the lp setting which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that i hate but in a live setting or to use it as a boost for soloing the hp setting could be quite useful as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to cut through the other instruments on stage if i had to summarize this pedal i would describe it as a tubescreamer you can rock with which is not to say that it s better than the tubescreamer necessarily but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your go to for rhythm chord sections soloing or both
759	i bought this to try out on my baritone uke it works great and is very easy to use i use it with my fender mustang i had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my martin dx i was able to attach it to the smoother hpl back and sides using the suction cup i wet it before attaching you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc for trouble mounting it could be used on just about any instrument some may need a clamp it picks up anything it is attached to it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp pretty cool nice price this device works well but sound is far from perfect distortion is more noticeable at higher volume for the price paid is a very reasonable option not the greatest little pick up for the price im more than happy with its performance put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny i wont fit in the sound hole to i clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well cant beat it for the price i like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole or for that matter to the headstock where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole it works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound not quite true to your guitar you will note this in particular with a classical guitar this can be balanced to some degree with your amp s equalizer and or the treble and bass settings however compared to the axl pickup which i bought for comparison the cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost tom times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles he was very happy with his gift i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out this one is definitely the best i use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke you do have to find the sweet spot but once you do it works great through my pignose amp and actually fits right inside my pignose great value and price too after purchasing many kinds of attachments to amplify my mandolin or fiddle with little or no satisfaction i ordered this little mic i didnt expect much considering the price it works so great i ordered a few more clip it into the guitar sound hole or on the head stock or on the mandolin head stock or on the fiddle each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky the cord is long enough for me to stand and move around some while i play that is a great bonus for me this foot controller is wonderful switch between all four channels and the volume pedal wah pedal and built in tuner makes it the complete package for my line amp i really like the cherub pickup it is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup i ve used the sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups i have the pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only feet long but for bucks it can t be beat i just play at home with friends it works well so far on all my ukuleles however every time you touch your instrument it s going to transmit that sound into your amp so it s nothing i d be using on stage if i didn t have to still it seems to be a good value but truth be told i haven t had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue time will tell i like the drum machine and the tuner but i don t like the effects i don t have an electric guitar i only have acoustic electric guitars and i thought that maybe i could make it sound like an electric but the sounds are distorted and not very clean it sound muff for an electric guitar maybe it would work fine but not for an acoustic electric guitar i recently purchased a vox mini g modeling amp to go with my new mainland tenor acoustic electric ukulele it was my first electric instrument and i immediately fell in love with the combination uke amp a little time went by and i began wishing i could plug my other non electric ukuleles and guitars into my amp i see diy pickup sets are pretty inexpensive but i didn t really want the expense times eight or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments then i stumbled on this cherub pickup for about the cost of lunch at mcdonalds it seemed i might electrify on the fly whatever instrument i cared to pickup so i bought it bottom line is that it works very well for my needs and although i don t have a very critical ear i think i can hear a slight quality clarity difference between the built in pickup on my mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments but that s not a surprise and such a small difference that i don t much care so far i ve been clipping it into the sound holes but i might try it on the headstock as others have recommended if you re a rock god don t even consider this why would you anyway but if you re a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while this cherub is for you this is more of a toy than a good pickup it functions but doesn t sound great what did i want for this price anyway i put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the g string and it sounds great what a buy for the price you may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot whatever spot you find is best for you it s worth it i m going to try it on my reso uke next well this work well with my uke and there is a review that pretty much sum it up put it on the headstock
760	i bought this during the black friday sale the price was right since if i was dissatisfied then i wouldn t be out that much money quality product well worth the purchase i would recommend this i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the cheapies i ve been dealing with musician s friend forever rogue is musician s friend s brand music is a musician s friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars i have several different models of rogue guitars and i m impressed with all of them the rogue ra is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the fender starcaster here s the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one once they realize it s not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten if you re not sure if you re serious about learning to play this is the guitar for you even if you re an intermediate to advanced player you still can t go wrong with this guitar it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument the finish and workmanship is also like what you d find on a more expensive guitar they look play and sound great many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price they figure a guitar that cheap can t be much good that s where they re wrong you have to actually play one to understand what i m talking about once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer this is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire if it happens to get damaged or stolen you re not out an arm and a leg i love fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar the rogue is a much better value than the fender and equal if not better in quality the rogue ra comes in a variety of color choices if or when you decide to sell it you can usually get back what you paid for it i give rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one i ve been playing guitar for years so i should know what i m talking about i do not own stock in musician s friend music or rogue guitars and i don t get paid to endorse them this review is my honest opinion sounds simply great as greasy as a pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume it changes its distortion the louder the more distorted the pignose power supply pignose ac power supply for pignose is helpful when been home but also works with aa batteries you can also amplify it s sound by connecting it to a higher watt amp it comes with really nice looking stickers i m planning to keep it for years update on review jan i admit that it might be more expensive that other watt amps but as time goes by i just fall more in love with my piggy i ve learned to use better it s own volume combined with the guitar s i have other amps of higher power that can get a lot louder that the pignose but i just love the level of distortion it gives i cannot get this crunch with the other amps no matter how much pedals bells whistles i have tried this crunch is unique and the world loves it as simple and plain as that the good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch i so much fell in love with the chords give a clean amazing sweet grumble the one that make teenage girls sigh for you with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk and the item pictured is nylon i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip
761	it has a pleasant smell to it not harsh at all a little goes a long way my guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop nothing to complain about most comfortable picks only complaint is that i would like four in a pack if you use all four fingers buy two sets for the price these can t be beat at this price it doesn t hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better i am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the boss me multi effects pedal this unit sounds good and is adjustable it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use there is no subtle setting on the flanger and so when it is on you know it i think it is pretty cool and i mostly use it on my fenders when i looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive i purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though i make every effort to avoid them and to protect the side where i rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time i ve used carnuba car wax many years ago and this is a much higher grade easier to apply easy to remove there were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that i did not notice at first and i was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface they were very minor and did not affect the wood but this will seal them not a sufficient defect to return the instrument another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal i have open tuning machines and before applying tri flow with a pinpoint applicator i used this wax let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel the chrome is gleaming they re really beautiful did a great job on the headstock as well with mop and abalone inlay when the strings were removed also got the tuning pegs this is a om acoustic only way i can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge i used distilled water so if someone left too much water possibly a problem but all worked fine for me so i heard these were good and ordered one to try i was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down a must have i like this capo because you can adjust the pressure but i ve had it pop of easily twice already have others i trust more this is one of the best tuner i have had what a great value for a low cost thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon
762	simple effective just what i wanted seems a tad flimsy but time will tell tuning couldn t be easier neat product good quality one i like the big size type would like to have a thinner one so far so good it is very easy to apply great results and very little effort i m surprised by the results never got this shine in my guitar with any other product i ordered a couple from my guitar seller enjoyed saw these and tried again the box for tuner was a little smushed but well packaged and arrived on time will order again if needed enjoy having a neck heavy epiphone sg g i really like this strap because it is not only comfortable but also provides enough friction to keep the guitar in place without much effort leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button works great great little tuner i would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed this is a handy little piece and for the money a great deal i have one of these for each of my guitars and they re as accurate as anything else i ve used when playing an electric bodyless violin that hurts the collar bone you must have one of these it changed the whole way i play now it performs ok although it takes a learning curve getting used to the strobe dial i found it too difficult to see from my pedal board i am over so eyes ain t what they used to be i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery adding a spot power proved difficult as the only way to run the battery adapter is along the side where the pedal is pushed i fixed problem by taking my dremmel and grinding a groove just big enough for wires to be unobstructed for the above reasons i have elected to use this as my work bench tuner for guitar set up and have gone to the ashdown engineering tuner for my pedal board it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right it s just a spring and a handle but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brand this one worked very well for me and at this price i am able to have a couple extra lying around all my guitars use this quick release clip its so easy to install and sturdy material it wont break easily even after many uses have one now i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn t work whereas this does the job i m happy i purchased this and didn t have to invest in purchasing v batteries every time i wanted to play guitar got this to tune my guitar without relying on rocksmith on my ps and to double check against it i have a pretty crappy ear so i rely on it to tune correctly responds fast display is incredible i wish my car dash looked like this thing fits easily on the headstock of the guitar in front or behind tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument not using a microphone so you can tune even if it is noisy and any pedals effects amps etc in the setup do not affect the tone you are tuning the actual resonance of the string even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too for the price i would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one i got this to clean my washburn acoustic guitar and it worked great i used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft lint free rag and it would act like a polish the finish sparkled afterwards even in the light great product really they are i really don t have anything more to say about it i ve played for years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever affordable accurate and they don t fall off your knee all the time lol good strings for my electric guitar i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more great tuner for the price makes tunning easy and fast the grips come off the neck on my acoustic but works better on my electric i seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and i have great access to it fantastic for those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you and it folds up keep it right in your case very cool tool to have thanks for years i have used a different type of capo this one is so much easier to use and does an excellent job i was not sure about this at first seemed too cheap to work but i was happily surprised it works welll not perfect but not expensive get one nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it happy buyer thank you very much this tuner is affordable and it works well i have purchased six so far they are sturdy they have all come with a battery in the box you have to install yourself i actually sat on one and thought i broke it turned out the main tuner head pops right back on to the goose neck the led is bright in low light but does not display well in bright daylight if the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery the fairly large disk style battery cost me for a two pack at walgreens we had a birthday jam at a friends house i used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists at the end of the night i gave it to the birthday boy as he had admired it all night i gave one to my grand nephews i keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars they stay on in their cases i like the goose neck style but i have not tried the other no neck swivel ones i also have one for my bass it s a great musician s party favor i always had trouble reading my old analog tuners in low light so i really like these tuners don t forget practice practice practice what can i say i love this thing i bought three more after trying the first one i put one in each of my guitar bags can t live without it the tuning is excellent and so easy if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it it s a great little tuner great accuracy but unfortunately they are a bit on the delicate side the first one started working about a week after i bought it just broke down the second one i purchased had a break when it arrived after piecing the two of them together i have a nice stable tuner but beware these are manufactured on the cheap these are my favorite guitar strings they are very long lasting and sound great i would recommend these for anyone beginners or even people who play seriously or perform they are very good strings worth the cost it s a pretty cool little gizmo the clip on feature is really helpful too makes me wonder what i did before i had one i don t know why others rated it as a star it is exactly what it says it is and works fine i ve had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos what the hell anyway this capo works well i ve only used it on gibson and fender electrics and it does a fine job some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off but it does not affect the capo abilities i m sure there are better ones but for me this works well my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it it s been in heavy use hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and i don t think we ve even had to replace the batteries yet it s got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust we tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn t loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust this one is great i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly i bought my dad one too he loves it too super excellent for dimly lighted rooms serves it s purpose really well and i plan to keep one of these handy from now on thanks for good quality products at a fair price works great and does a good job a must have type tool for the price get one light takes up little space and easy to use clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar pluck a string and it will indicate what it is turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done takes minutes to tune the guitar mine is electric works plugged in or unplugged i m using this footswitch to control a drum machine it does the job and i ve had no problems with it i bought this to use on my fender p bass it is not reliable for me sometimes it works and sometimes it can t find the low note correctly i m still using my roland stomp box tuner glad this was inexpensive it was not worth the hassle to return i gave it away this is more of a like it or hate kind of item if it doesn t work you hate it if it works there s nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it i love snark tuners this not being the first one i bought nor the last i loved the fact that i didn t have to press all the buttons like the other ones just get it relatively in tune by ear then this thing will help you with the rest my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip it has already pulled up and i only put it on and off my guitar maybe times so far i mean i ve had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad i m just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe a friend and i have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing restoring older guitars my friend had a tele custom made for him and needed a case so i ordered this one and it hits the spot the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesn t move at all my buddy likes the case so i am happy nothing gets stars there are no generals present i got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks i have on different bass the fact that it is wide is nice as others have said you need to slide the padding down but you can t beat these for the money when i look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables so bright and festive i just feel beautiful all over again i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar i would have given this item stars but even fully extended it is about too short as for the quality of the strap i love the look and feel of the leather it has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer my cents in summary i think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric this strap would work much better if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap i m normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever it was used and the strings were dismal sounding so i bought these d addario exls they hold pitch beautifully my only complaint has to do with my guitar technique not the strings having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric don t like my heavy handed approach to pressing down the strings as a result the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until i relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch it will take some getting used to or else i ll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing all of that said the strings are pure joy to play any guitarist knows how one of these works clamp it on the head turn it on and tune i ve tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass my only real complaint is that it often takes seconds to register the note it s getting it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well the low e on my bass will occasionally register as a b rd harmonic for example in general the dullest means of plucking the string finger instead of pick will give the quickest and most glitch free pitch all in all it s a handy little tool to have in the gig bag not quite as loaded as the red all instrument snark but it gets the job done is very sensitive to vibration i ve been using akorg tm large display digital tuner and metronomefor a long time with my guitar while adequate i wanted the snark because it was made specifically for guitar and the clip on feature would counter my laziness in finding the tuner the snark is great and the price is amazing the snark unlike the korg tunes by vibration so if it isn t attached the the guitar it won t work i feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient with the korg the dial would spin all over the place and i would just mentally estimate where the right tone would be the snark is much more decisive and faster so it eliminates all the guesswork out of tuning you will know exactly how sharp or flat the guitar is or if you want to try alternative tunings like drop d it is so much simpler than with the korg no metronome but that s what i m keeping the korg for i also wish that this specific came in another color other than black there are snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars overall extremely happy with this purchase it had been a while since i had some eb s best packaging i have seen and for the price don t order just one pack very pleased always have a spare pair in your case i play guitar bass and violin and more i have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay in fact that may be saying too much i was really surprised at the snark sn tuner i found it very accurate i compared it to my boss tu tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter i decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the snark no one would ever do this this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope i plan on buying the higher quality snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter very impressed with this if i can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board i will be happy these are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so i don t have to move it around as i change guitars during performances i am a long time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments wanted to like this but first the positives looks great nice easy to read display the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs the clip seems sturdy tuner is compact nice pricenow the significant disappointment inaccuratethe settings were on a but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing the tuning was sharp i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners very disappointing i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price however since d addario now owns planet waves products they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner it has its place i guess but i much prefer the larger one too bad they made this decision imo i haven t settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models bottom line no matter how nice the snark is in many ways the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately not only string to string but to a standard a having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation i have several snarks they are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with fast and accurate the sn is a little faster and slightly more accurate than the other older models with a brighter display at slightly reduced battery life but they are all great i have lots of tuners and several brands of clip ons this is my favorite there is no close second i play string bass in a band and at church as well as guitar i love this tuner i ve been playing guitar for over years and been through many different style of tuners this is by far the best i ve ever had not only is it accurate and easy to use but it s so convenient simply clip it to the head of the guitar press the only button on the unit and start tuning also unlike other tuners i ve used this tuner does a great job of filtering ignoring ambient noise in the room i can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation even with the tv on in the room pro s vibrant easy to read display no need for cords chargers even when used on electric guitars bass simple one button activation lightweight i leave it on my classical guitar all the time especially after restringing auto shutoff also can manually shut it off just press the one button a second time works for guitar and bass both acoustic and electric and violin also works on my ukulele con s wish i had this years ago bottom line this is a no brainer the price quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist i have quite a few guitars and i like to keep them clean and polished this stuff is great for my fretboard and i use it every time i change the strings jj s are great tubes this at replaced a ax in the preamp of an epi valve jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone it was very nice but i found an old american made au that i like more the jj is still a great tube i love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly the tuner picks up vibrations so it doesn t require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar there s just one button so it s idiot proof however the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soon speaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but i hate that they used the cr battery it just doesn t last long and in brazil it s really hard to find this battery at all they still work years later i ve had to change a few batteries but they last a long time fabulous tuner even works on a stand up bass just clip it onto the bridge excellent product pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments their low cost black nylon guitar strap is a well constructed high quality item that is a top seller at amazon the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick about inch although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug some type of strap retainer would still be recommended black works with most colors and this strap should last for a long time but it is so inexpensive if you qualify for free shipping you might want to consider ordering a spare
763	works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking i ve had two of these tuners and they do a fine job as far as i can tell i lost one and had to buy another one i also bought a much more expensive tuner and i cannot see that it does a better job than this one i bought my first tuner like this one about years ago and the rubber pads kept falling off but i have not had that problem with my new one i love these picks i bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy it is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely i have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings i put aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good it is amazing what difference the strings can make i have ukuleles in different sizes and they all have aquila strings highly recommended i couldn t be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on amazon this was a newly listed item on amazon when i bought it in fact this review will be the first so i was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback but i m glad i decided on this item i wanted something with several storage compartments so i could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly this bag has six separate compartments for storage three main zipped compartments each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items perfect i also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled as well as a guitar strap that i don t currently require as i already have one but it s nice to have a spare now the padding of the bag is quite thin but firm so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying the two built in back pack straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to if you are in the market for a guitar bag and don t want to spend a fortune i would definitely recommend you consider this item it is perfect for my requirements and may well be for yours too i have use this tuner for quite a few years its easy to use clip it on and go i just bought of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or mandolin the price was good see ya i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value more expensive cables may be more rugged but for the price i m very happy with the hosa s i have purchased i use this for my uke my string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty taylor easy to use very accurate highly recommended there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn and by that i mean the design flaws you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading and they eat batteries like crazy the snark sn is far superior my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great i don t know what stock strings it came loaded with but they sounded just fine its a tight fitting case i am a proud owner of aepiphone les paul custom proand it fits as snug as can be when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic i am sure i received a new case being perfectly protected as it was it hadn t a mark on it so as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means it looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job to protect the guitar my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit with this said over time there is a possibility of wear i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail and then handle doesn t look as durable as it could be we ll see on that overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul i saw the gibson case and i just don t see them as superior enough to justify paying more i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be five stars for now i will edit in the future if necessary no much to these things but they are cheap and they work great in the studio they shipped quickly and didn t break the bank addario strings are ok although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder aquila seems to be the most popular now i have used both and i am satisfied with both i play the soprano concert tenor and baritone each one different in it on right also play the the concert scale banjolele only been playing the uke for years and the banjo for so it is only imho be aware though that years experience can mean year experience times if an initially unfavorable opinion changes i owe it to the maker to say so so i m saying so for me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used it s not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down in many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved as far as the sn is concerned wrong i ve found the sn to in fact be super tight but one has to insure that there isn t even a hint of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar this is what i don t like about the other type of snark display it s not symmetric it requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit if the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat when i m on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish in that regard the image shown here is wrong it shows the super tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with green and even a yellow uhm no the sn is super tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semi tones if that s what floats your boat and as they say on tv all for an incredibly low price i keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case at this price i already have a half dozen super tights with two more on the way this little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off it works without it but things things like that putt me nuts the snark is great i have for my ukuleles so i can always find one and a rd for my guitar it s not just a uke tuner love them and gavemy grandson a shock blue one to go with his american flag painted uke im a huge fan of elixir s this however is my first go with the polyweb but there is no disappointment here i bought both this stamp for guitar and also one from the same company for mandolin ukulele banjo i m pleased with both stamps large enough to see useful to stamp chords on my own music sheets and other music that dos not have guitar chords shown this is my third snark tuner i keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear i use it on all my stringed instruments haven t tried it on a base this tuner is easy to attach and read and the price is great i have spent bucks on tuners that do not function as well first time for a soft wedgie pick that is i did have an older brother i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great very good price and looks like they will last awhile i highly recommend they for you to try if you don t like they you can give a fellow musian a soft wedgie which they just may like these are great little tuners you can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly which is especially helpful when you re breaking in strings or any time i ve played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts great replacement string for your ukulele great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku awesome instrument it stays in tune and is fun to play the best that i ve spent in a long time after a week i m already playing songs and i m not a string player don t purchase this without buying a tuner i bought the snark sn uku tuner it s awesome too i m sick of protools and i wanted to find something cheap and easy until i could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it i m using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick the problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input i ve tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn t external to the unit i even tested the exact same mic cable input into my mbox with protools and got a clean recording i actually like this unit s tone better than the mbox it seems more transparent if not for the hum it would get stars unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem the hum isn t loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise i even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem so it works for rough stuff for your own use but i wouldn t use it for anything you plan on passing around much this little gem is worth it s weight in gold so easy to tune with it we have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong automatic shut off helps too
764	nice microphone stand for the cost sturdy adjustable good construction it works we like it will purchase an extender to use with it if you are like me my research for a guitar connection to my ipad left me with choosing between the iriffport and the jam i recently purchased and then returned the iriffport i am very pleased that i purchased the apogee jam as a replacement here are the reasons why the connector on the iriffport the one that goes into the ipad is not a strong connection at all it feels as though it could disconnect at any time i have a stand to put my ipad on when jamming such that the ipad is in landscape mode so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way with the apogee jam the connector is just like the ipad s connector except it also has the prongs that come out of it securing the connector into the ipad to remove the connector from the ipad you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the prongs go in so it can be removed very very secure i use the gumdrop case on my ipad which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used this flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used important if you have such an ipad case like me i certainly feel that the jam will provide a much more secure connection to your ipad over the iriffport in fact the structure of the iriffport connector was so large that i felt that it did not fit well through my case on the other hand the jam s connector is the same small size as the ipad s original connector this is also something to consider if you intend to use your ipad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the ipad probably the largest reason i prefer the jam over the iriffport you can hear sound directly from the ipad with the iriffport you must use headphones or attach external speakers i tried headphones with the iriffport and playing the guitar was very awkward nonetheless with the jam i could attach headphones or external speakers to the ipad if i chose to do so i wanted something that could make my ipad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers with the jam i have this the jam has a gain meter i e an led and a gain control the iriffport does not when not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio the led lets you know if you are connected to the ipad but not to any software blue light or if you are connected to the ipad and to a software application green light there are no batteries needed for the jam or the iriffport i personally like that i can use my own guitar cord with the jam if the cord breaks i simply replace the cord not my ipad connection device the iriffport uses its own cord and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my normal guitar cable i used with the jam although a fairly minor point it is nice to know that the jam is advertised by apple look at their website and their garageband video and since i have garageband on my ipad i was pleased to see that the advertising material on the jam states specifically that it works with garageband so far i m very pleased with the jam they say months i ve never come close to even a month usually weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that weeks if it sounds too good to be true it usually is i don t recommend these my only reluctance about getting this was i thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but i unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does it gets down my guitar tracks in ipad and sounds terrific so the price tag isn t such a big deal no learning curve simply connect the included cable from the jam to your pin ipad dock plug in your guitar pull up garageband select an amp click on the icon in garageband that shows the guitar cable end then select on for monitoring hit record and start jamming man that is all there is to it i ve not been one to record on computers for a long time preferring instead to use such things as fostex track recorders behringer mixers digitech effect pedals etc but this is going to change all that awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use update i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx i discovered that this apogee jam will take the signal routed standard guitar type in cable from the behringer s control out l mono thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs both microphone guitar the sound quality doing this is excellent i ve recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam consequently my opinion of the apogee jam is even higher than it was when i wrote my initial review in march i may not even need that focusrite box now the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out what was thought to be a doa model ended up being a mistake on my behalf my iphone s which i have had for about a year now must ve had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine unless trying to use the jam in the box comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios it is bigger than i had imaginedit s almost the length of an iphone feels nice and is very light the cords aren t very long
765	amazing i plugged this little gadget into my strat put on my headphones and wow i was super surprised the sound is amazing you can adjust the amount of gain and volume to fine tune your sound whether your playing through humbuckers or single coils i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody i plug this little monster into my compressor and from the compressor to the guitar and the sound is amazing i really like the sound and the fact that it is totally portable and independent of power runs on two aaa batteries the digital delay effect is activated independently same little switch just one extra click which is fine but you can t adjust the speed or mix that s ok though because the factory setting works just fine if you want a touch of delay all in all i highly recommend this vox amplug lead guitar headphone amp for its sound and price one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile although it does exactly what it says it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard it is significantly thicker than i expected which makes it difficult to use properly without covering the entire board i purchased one strip and i will use it on my backup board but i don t plan to purchase any more this power grip pedalboard mounting tape is velcro on steroids this product makes your pedals super secure the tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping teeth would make the jaws shark envious word of advice make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board once down you can pretty much count on an almost perment mounting and a hint some pedals like behringer have a rubber bottom remove these rubber non skid plates because they come off too easily also amazon sells couplers these take less room and cut down on the clutter as a matter of fact amazon sells every thing you need to put together a pro board i have of these combo packs and they are simply great i have pedals connected to these visual sound spot units on my pedaltrain pro and have all the wiring underneath looks pretty neat along with the george l s cables that are almost invisible the spot works wonderfully and generates no noise hiss or buzz connects and powers great no need for something fancy to effectively power up to of v pedals with one combo pack the adaptors work great with other than the regular ac connections like those found on mxr or boss pedals highly recommended i ve been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as i play on a weekly basis and it has been great being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily i ve owned it for a while now and haven t had any problems with it i was first exposed to the hercules locking mechanism when our praise band leader brought in his hercules two guitar stand and i tried it with both my full size string guitar and my string banjo i was impressed when i decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room amateur studio i was excited to find that the same hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall hanger models i put them on my wish list where my son daughter in law found them and bought three for me for christmas this last weekend i just finished putting them up and i m completely satisfied with their solid construction they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably i used the provided screws which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls i probably wouldn t trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall but instead get something more substantial to mount it like a toggle anchor what i m happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments the opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and string guitars but not so wide as to not support my string banjo i ve submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical string guitars and string banjo my friend plays gretch semi hollow body and fender solid body and other electric guitars with his hercules guitar stand so i assume they would also work with the wall hangers i am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy what a nice product rugged and well made the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs i was able to build a pedal board with a tuner delay distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare it looks very neat and tidy using george l s makes it look even better i will buy one of these again these things rock edit still a great little board but i found power grip pedal board velcro this board that the new velcro make this an unstopable unit i ve been using finger ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars it has multiple uses cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands extending the life and tone of your strings lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints etc from the top sides and back will not harm most finishes as far as i know i usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well i did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference i m not sure if this is true as i ve never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers however i typically try to keep it off of electronic components in general just out of common sense for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile just order a few at a time and find free shipping you ll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time
766	forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand doubt i ll use the strap but then again i probably will try to use it that way this is real bone the length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar it is just my luck that i have some sandpaper in my garage so i sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about minutes of sanding you will want this to save your battery s when there is no power around not much more to say good luck seems to be made well length was perfect for my application and there have been no problems with functionality or connectivity using the cable these make great and affordable mic cables not much else to say it works and looks well made definitely recommend it it s a very cute little capo it works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it s hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are very small but it works what a good buy this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice luv the zip pocket in the front perfect for strap snark capo whatever bought this for my hubby s tenor uke and one just like it tho smaller for my concert uke highly recommend
767	i have a solid non weight relief les paul traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me like these better then the bulkier dunlops i tried this in front in the middle and at the end of an effects chain as well as by itself plugged into the effects loop of my mesa boogie mark v amplifier whenever it is in the path as soon as i engage my effects loop the signal level drops considerably it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not the chorus effect is good but i don t want my volume to drop every time i turn on my effects loop i have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that i use so i can t raise the send any more i don t really care for the fx loop on my fender supersonic head as i started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the mxr pedals so when this came out last year i snatched one up and started experimenting with it i love it bypassed i still get that in your face strait into an amp sound but ingage it with my delays and phase s and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss very cool and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank this tuner is wonderful you can tune all strings in same time it s halpfull in stage because you don t need to test each string individually
768	this unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a usb audio input i have not used the headphone monitoring section doubt i ever would so i cannot comment on that feature but this unit is so simple to use that i was pleasantly surprised for anyone in a band out there i used this device to take a line out from our pa system into an old laptop running free audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording this even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage the coversion cable didnt work t is axlr to ubs cable i have the red blinking light syndrome also but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for send it back so izm thanks hde for wasting my time go sell your snake oil to someone else i bought this to daisy chain two small kustom powered pa cabinets virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application this cable filled the bill perfectly this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for it sounded brilliant while it wasn t broken for about the hours of runtime it works if it isn t abused at all but if you abuse it in any way at all your out an xlr cable i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage needed to get mic into computer via the usb port just try to find amazon had it and at a good price
769	i was concerned when i bought this that my microphone stand would be prone to tipping over since there isn t a counterweight however not only does this thing lock in tight and not slowly tip down like other boom stands i ve used in the past but it hasn t tipped over yet after quite a bit of use well its a stand its super cheap and i don t mean the price the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well instructions were ok came with more parts than what were required all holes filled and i have of of each part extra the guitars do not sit very well in this stand i will use it until i can find a better one it will get replaced i really should send this pos back to amazon the concept is great but the execution of it sucks it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand there are better options out there for something portable this stand is worth tops if i had it to do all over i would save my money this speaker has a very clear full range sound i have it in a brown deluxe and am very good with it in a way it reminds me a bit of a jbl with the smooth depth and clarity if i want a little ray charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack cool speaker and nice addition these picks are comparable in shape and feel to grisman s dawg picks and frankly cheaper the thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and depending on how you play this may or may not be acceptable in my opinion if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge you ll get a woody warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks for guitar i prefer a mm traditional tri corner shape but that s a different review if however you re really a fan of a biting high treble sound these picks are probably not your best choice unless you re willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper in fact a pack of three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you re searching for your ideal tone if you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin chances are your attack tone and volume are generally softer and i think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you re not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it s just slowing you down for such a lighter stroke i d recommend the mm tri corner i use for guitar i have one spots which came with the multi plug cable after reading a little bit on the internet i read that the one spots can handle almost pedals each depends on the pedal power handling etc so i saw they had an plug cable and figured i would try it out with adding many more pedals to my board this is perfect def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once this pedal is a great delay pedal works well with my marshall has a lot of feautures and is very versitale this might be a really really nice stand but the one i received was defective one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won t attach so i have to return it for a refund i ll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it s intact this time it s been a while since last we got together the old amps we had were way too big for me this one is just right fender mustang i electric guitar amplifier it works great it keeps my music in order i am able to see my music this has been a very useful tool very nice quality i ve removed star because of the casing the sheath likes to twist off a little too easily i used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up other than that i ve been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great although i have a pedal board with effect pedals there are additional effects on my amplifier i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button is sturdy and good for price
770	i am trying to learn to play violin but was having difficulty finding the proper fingering for the notes this has been very helpful for me to check finger position i will be removing it when i can consistently find the proper placing for my fingers this has also help me in tuning the violin rogue g w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing actually it s loud enoucht for home recommend it they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so this item was purchased because i m doing self teaching on the fiddle i figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while i m learning since i m used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions i also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you want it did take some measuring to get this in place i had to be very careful to put it on squarely the closer i got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line but not so much that it would affect how to use the template one things i had to deal with was to make sure i had a mm measuring devise the bridge of the violin had to be mm from the nut it took some doing but i was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes good for any beginner but consultation with a teacher if you have one is recommended for ham fisted persons positioning is not easy for lossening strings proper bridge resetting and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required measuring requires a hard ruler with a full milimeters required bet you don t have one or a technician s measuring tape and confident measuring skill measuring is best with a cooperative assistant bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the d string to hold the bridge position measurement check tightening the a string measurement check removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the st and th strings and tuning the instrument do it you ll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing if you ain t intelligent good luck you d best be served with dot stickers
771	excellent picks with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth the only problem i have is that i keep changing my mind between whether i want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing these are a great addition to any mandolin player s case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a fender heavy put away your effects pedals modellers and software for awhile and get back to the earth or at least the simple appreciation of what an electric guitar sound can be straight off the axe with nothing but pickups volume and tone pots to shape it for me the classic pignose and a strat sound is the opening of i looked away from layla but i m sure everyone s got their favorites loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of natural sounding distorted tones stick an sm in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking it s a tube amp by working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound along with that barely breaking up holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players by learning how much you can do with relatively little you ll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone shaping tools that have come along since it might surprise those who take today s hyper saturated over processed metal distortion for granted as the official community sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain one bit of weirdness when i began playing my pignose i immediately noticed a buzz as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill the four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and sure enough an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice the first amp i ever had was a small ampeg tube from the early s with a single inch speaker volume and tone knobs i ve no idea how many watts it put out not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door with that baby cranked i spent many happy hours in tone heaven all these years and amps later i guess i ve always been searching for that sound and the pignose comes closer than any tube distortion blues overdrive pedal or rat ty box i ve tried for the money you can t beat it this pick is well designed for mandolin playing unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners it s also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing this is my second after breaking the last one s neck the plastic socket around the ball socket joint couldn t take the stress in the gig bag i ll keep this one by the music stand great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek this works amazing it is very thick which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin it also works great for a guitar it works really nice with steel strings but i have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings this is a good pick they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison wegens definitely click less are easier to grip and bring out the natural woody sound and character of the instrument if you are looking for something that will progress with you you may wish to look elsewhere
772	works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking i ve only been playing ukulele for about years so i m new to using a capo it seems to hold tight i really like epiphone products they are well made easy to play guitars i also purchased an ep les paul special ebony from amazon a while back but i received this uke defective i expected when i plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but i couldn t here anything at all totally dead there are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down i m disappointed because i expect gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory i actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when i got over to his house and it didn t work in front of him i just requested a return exchange from amazon if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me i seem to have bad luck with electric acoustic guitars when purchased through amazon i had to send back my dean string elec acoust to amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem i do want to state that this is a beautiful uke with nice feeling nylon strings fine wood high polished surface high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture if this uke was working i would have given it a or great bag well padded the shoulder strap is nice perfect and very good price what you would come to expect from lanikai awesome instrument it stays in tune and is fun to play the best that i ve spent in a long time after a week i m already playing songs and i m not a string player don t purchase this without buying a tuner i bought the snark sn uku tuner it s awesome too dunno how but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasn t installed the pickguard is no biggie i actually didn t want it on there it seems oversized to me if i wanted it on there tho it s got a peel off sticky back not having a cable was kinda a big deal i sent an email to epiphone gibson got a response within a day and after sending in proof of purchase they promised to send me a cable nice customer service as far as the uke the finish on mine was perfect no blemishes i can see i did change out the strings and it does sound a little better i suppose but not that much probably would have messed around on the stock strings a bit longer but i listened to the reviews and did a change right away for if you want a uke this one looks awesome and plays well
773	this bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount i am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an ernie ball strap the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest summary for those who don t want to read the whole thing this is more than worth the money if you re a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you re experienced and are searching for a backup travel option or anything like that get this do not hesitate a cheap guitar doesn t always mean a pos alright full story review so when i was a kid up until my early teens my insanely talented and self taught older brother helped me learn how to play guitar i got pretty decent but somewhere along the way i stopped and i ve regretted it basically every day ever since then recently i decided to stop internally griping about it and realized i should actually do something about it so here i am having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists i have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and i have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars like a typical beginner s first act i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it i got way more than i bargained for i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited there was no way i could afford to dive right in and buy a high end top of the line fender or martin like i had had the benefit of learning on back in the day i knew i had to go cheap at least for now i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars after an exhaustive amount of research i chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos i d pulled up on youtube were excellent plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general despite the positive reviews i was still a bit leery buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble even if it sounds nice and plays well sometimes a perfectly solid functional instrument just doesn t feel right as i went through the checkout i silently reminded myself that i could send it back for any reason i went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility i d just have to bite the bullet and buy something better even if costlier well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed i certainly didn t expect perfection and i was convinced that i would find some kind of error if only cosmetic with such a cheap guitar i am here to tell you that i have not found anything wrong with it even if i had unless it drastically affected the sound playability of the instrument it would still be worth the price along with the guitar i bought some new strings martins because times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable i see that some of the other reviewers disagree maybe their strings were older or maybe it s just preference i don t know all i can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded old shockingly enough the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box it doesn t seem to have any trouble staying in tune either all of that being said it wouldn t hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe i mean i m sure that when i do finally put the martins on i ll be even more mind blown than i already am with the way it sounds this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets oh and contrary to what other reviews have said yes it does have a truss rod while we re talking about its positives let s not ignore the fact that it s also super attractive with its shiny black finish there isn t much about it that would give away its price no it s not a guitar but it certainly doesn t play like a guitar either i don t regret this purchase at all even in the future when i progress and upgrade i will definitely be keeping this lovely gem if you re still unsure do what i did and listen to some demos on youtube i doubt you ll be disappointed pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did he clearly doesn t know what he s talking about and i as well as everyone else in the comments section was sure to express my feelings about that haha one user even claimed epiphone should sue him check out the video reviews by the users companies goldhat samashmusic giggear and shadowfw my only complaint about this guitar is that i didn t buy it sooner good luck on your search i hope this review has helped this is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely thick and durable made of awesome material buy it i ve played the guitar for a number of years some of them professionally and during that time i ve owned guitars by fender gibson ovation b c rich yamaha and applause that said admittedly this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap expendable guitar that was reasonably playable that i could take with me when i go camping while my expectations weren t all that high due to guitar s price upon reading other reviews and having experienced takamine s quality i decided to gave this jasmine a try i m glad i did what a nice guitar it turned out to be out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive the neck action was nicely set up the intonation is spot on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely note that i changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos the jasmine s c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price nice basic guitar strap great price and should last long enough i have started using the padded levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap this can be a little scratchy i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best great picks sampler not cheap as far as pics are concerned but it s definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then if you re new it helps you find what you like if you re experience you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound i use thin picks and so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i don t use i actually like the dunlop brand material so once i get used to thicker ones i ll try these the pack only have and thicker in case you re looking for very thin ones if so then don t buy this sample pack go and buy the dunlop nylon or purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me this cloth cleans up pretty well but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook i dunno if they weren t meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is a lot more durable than this cloth they do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better like a previous reviewer i m a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer update putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up x better than before i like this and my ernie ball cloth from to starts
774	put a set of these on my rogue grand concert now the guitar stays in tune beautifully worth every penny this is a great guitar for the money it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments the built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it this is more of a like it or hate kind of item if it doesn t work you hate it if it works there s nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it i ve used mine on my electric and acoustic guitars and it is easy to use quick to reposition frets the strings properly it is cost effective and looks good nice to have a color option not the usual black that everyone else seems to have i need a wider one for my mm classic guitar s neck that is also flat this capo cannot work with it if i lost it i would definitely get another just like it this is an amazing guitar for the price i wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection the guitar has good tone and action the built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently the guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in the pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud the guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified but i prefer the acoustic sound the finish is a bit more orange than pictured you could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one
775	this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect i used a felt pick that was made in the s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable i bought a set of mahalo felt picks and while they seem nice they re too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and i get a raspy harsh tone when picking single strings i know many people love these felt picks but i ve found a set of soft rubber picks here on amazon that give me a tone that s much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick i bought these because they were an add on offer and i m glad i did i don t play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass these are a little too soft for guitar check out the dunlops but i m going to make sure i have some of these around too i love these picks i bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy it is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely i don t often use a pick for my soprano uke the mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that i really like especially if i m looking for a brighter sound filter works very well and looks professional only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure my thumb got sore i hadn t played any of my string instruments for some time the finger tips on my left hand were no longer callused and my right ukulele strumming thumb was tender from being out of practice hence my purchase of these felt picks the picks are fine they are useful my only comment is that i really like a felt pick that is thicker and a little softer these are good but different not sure that title is good grammar but anyway i have gotten so much use out of my h i m a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye and ear opening for those kids it is very easy to use the various recording quality settings are useful so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space saving mp setting you can record stereo from just in front of the unit or you can turn on way all around recording i ve used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments i often record one part of a duet then play along with it you can do some editing on the unit but it s easier to download the track and use some software to do it i have gone direct to disk though just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end which is some of the editing you can do on the h there is little to fault with it it takes a while to rename a track for instance but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download prior to this i had a sony minidisc recorder which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time i bought it i finally got tired of messing with discs i am very glad i got the h i picked this simple interface up back in and i can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years it s been gigged dropped and even rained on however it still sounds great and functions perfectly i was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free asio all driver i was able to get anywhere between ms and ms latency under windows it was plug and play with the default wdm driver however to really take advantage of capabilities you ll want to install asio all especially if you re using ableton fl studio energyxt etc all and all the uca is pretty limited however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your pc for the functionality alone it s definitely worth asking price i wan t sure i would like this thing when i ordered it but it was cheap enough to try i don t like using it as much as i thought i would but that s just me the device works as advertised over a long period of use i think it might leave a mark on the sound hole even though the hook is padded
776	really nice i found them easy to put on and to use on the guitar and easy to play thanks my pet use to roam the car while driving he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more i sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and i see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap but i don t know why maybe other people don t really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before it wasn t too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds but once i got it on it was stiff and felt odd it was very uncomfortable around my neck and i took it off my guitar in a matter of matters i would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap unless you re just going for something that is inexpensive does the job and isn t designed for comfort i bought three of these at the same time to replace some older straps that were starting to rip and fall apart they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons two out of the three i bought are still performing well but one of them quickly cracked around the hole where that the strap button goes through and will occasionally slip off not a huge deal because that seems to happen with almost every guitar strap i ve ever bought a one point or another but it happened quicker with this particular strap i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
777	this pedal is outstanding for the price the feel is great and it doesn t move at all when you put it down on the floor the only thing i disliked was that it doesn t support half dampening like most of the higher end pedals around this price range i got this for christmas of and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio great product i use this in my recording studio to allow musicians their own level of monitoring in their headphones for recording and playback so far i ve had this item for about a week and it has worked flawlessly and given the exact results i needed musicians love being able to control their own headphones rather than having the engineer in the control room raise and lower their levels i ordered just to try it since it was so cheap the first one arrived in non working condition wires inside werent even soldered so i ordered a replacement plugged it in and it didnt work either the second wasnt soldered either i know its cheap but i expected it to at least work do not buy this is a great cymbal stand sturdy tight well made using it with a crash and does not move or rattle amazingly well constructed stand for the price going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these great product i am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all but it is a great stand for my studio practice kit being honest don t know how it would be for a gigging drummer but for what i am using it for more than does the job ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago i did a little comparison to a pretty old sm that i ve have since ish and it was actually very good the pyle has more gain then the old and as for sound i would say they are damn near identical to my ear i did the a b test by mic ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic s in the very same positions i would recommend for sure here s a link to an a b comparison i did with an sm the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver it fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base as with any daddario or planet waves product it s always great quality and has great tone i ve used almost every brand of stings out there but i always come back to daddario
778	i use to protect my microphones of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone very good product i recommend it s not an entire bridge assembly but it s exactly what i needed in my opinion it is worth the money these foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do and they do it just about average as you expect my only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis shaped upon delivery if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it nothing fancy snug fit for my mic kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic well built the adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about or degree increments possible positions between upright and horizontal best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck i m using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the stand to give me a bit more room but there is no counter weight here so its best used at shallow angles if i was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar or if on stage energy has you moving a lot more i would opt for a boom stand instead
779	the best buy for your bass drum i couldn t say that i loved it it s only a guitar hanger it just holds a guitar if i needed another i would buy this type this is a nice leather mandolin strap fits fine on my cheap rogue a type mandolin amazingly it is made in canada not china the leather is very smooth and flexible not stiff like some cheap straps i have never played a string instrument and it looks like i ll be able to get the hang of this very quickly only problem is the strings sting one play s dead meaning it will not stay in tune not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon i own a number of guitar hangers this one was a good buy for the money i have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive but also a good deal pricier for what i spent for this one it is adequate as long as it holds up pun intended an old school delay that works very well simple to use adjustments for intensity and length uses v batt or power adaptor reasonably priced i have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it boy was i surprised this case is awesome great quality fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great definetly reccomend this case i ve got three of these to hold an acoustic a mini strat and a jazzmaster while i had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former i was somewhat leary about the later it s quite a bit heavier than the other two but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart i have been trusting it do not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full size electric and i have my doubts about those plugs the hanger will hold but the drywall might not get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument i used a different setup philips slotted round heads would have actually been better to fix them to a nice piece of x x pine and screwed that into the studs with some screws needless to say it s not going anywhere as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall ok one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a jazzmaster arrived promptly nicely packaged holding my instruments securely i ll likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use install hangars they are reliable so far they do not hurt anything on your instrument i am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars violin how self adjusting can they be apparntly quite this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger small footprint allows me to place in my studio and get that deep sound like a big tube amp use a shure mike at feet and the sound is amazing recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue really happy with sound i am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar and it seems to work fine no complains very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound very high gain fits in all size soundholes good heavy construction of course it s not great i m not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself if you have a taylor martin or gibson that s not already ae this is not for you i probably didn t even need to say that i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup it s just a matter of how much you want to or can spend i m happy with this pickup joe i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box i guess boxes is good as it provides more protection sadly when i tried to use them amp it didn t work i checked the wall plug cord flicked several switches and knobs but still didn t work needless to say i sent the amp back to amazon which was quick and painless i wanted an exchange i expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me but i was shocked to find out that as soon as the return ups label was recorded at the ups store they shipped out another amp and it arrived in days since i returned the first one wow that s customer service the amp is great small footprint sounds great for what i want it for which is bedroom basement practice amp does it s job very nicely i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless honestly i don t think i will every fully utilize the full capability of the fuse software i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there i may use someone else s uploaded presets and play with the various options later on in summary stars for the amp and stars for the customer service i just got them i bought and put them up so i don t know about longevity so far though they work great and seem to be sturdy enough and the price is great i am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar classical acoustic guitar electric guitar electric bass guitar string and mandolin the hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability cable worked fine but the strain relief for the cable end came out when i took it out of the package you can even see it on the left in the picture that it s crooked because there s barely anything holding it in so it provides no protection for the cable signal seems fine so if you re not going to use it or move it around alot it works if you re going to be gigging with it i d get something with a real strain relief i can t really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings it sounds really good on my classical guitar will buy it again in the future this is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place the mount screws were too low of quality to use though i went and got my own mount screws was able to use black ones that matched better as these did not work that well and i did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them light weight easy to install holds very well does exactly what it was designed to do hold a guitar on a wall monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end i initially purchased a pair ofmonster rock instrument cable feet angled to straight inch plugto use with my keyboards but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar i thought i d pinch a few pennies i am so glad i did i compared this cable model to the more expensive models i previously purchased and aside from looks could not detect any difference in sound i swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards ensuring that each model was used on each instrument still no difference what the more expensive model has going for it is looks i am not sure it the higher priced model is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling bottom line carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp if possible before making a purchase decision you may find as i did that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value even from the same manufacturer it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell if you can wait a month for delivery or longer if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up if you have over a guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too i have decided to build my own i had bought an sn and love it but i found it had a little trouble recognizing the low e on my bass this handles bass tuning much better the lit display is great for tuning on stage and because it works on vibration you don t need to worry about muting when you are tuning i also find it very accurate i would have given it stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer the hanger was very easy to install holds my acoustics safely the instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hanger the product arrived within days i couldn t believe how fast it got here and yet the price is the best part of all so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles would never use a pitch pipe again and i guess i might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly the screws anchors are poor if you are not putting this into a stud go get you some better anchors do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only it s not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isn t for you if you are looking for a solid easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it won t get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you it works great to hang a standard size guitar on there is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but i am not sure it has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs aren t bumped and hangs straight just touching the wall with the body i recommend it this is a good quality strap it is wide and has leather ends it fits my les paul just fine and i am sure it willlast a long time with normal use can t go wrong for the price i got the irig thinking i d use it for performance but he app leaves somthing to be desired i had a very hard time fining a tone i could live with plus once you add any of the virtual pedals the feedback was rediculous well made xlr pin adaptor to mini needed to get a real xlr mic into the computer and this did the job if you are like me and truly value your usually expensive prized instruments then you want to make sure nothing happens to them accidentally or otherwise the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest they have a better base design and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling no worries just make sure you lower it all the way as it is designed to be these things are awesome also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands all of the other tri stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together not here plenty of room for everything now this stand and the double version which i also own lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet with all other stands i am always worried that my guitar will slide off or if it gets bumped that it could fall out this mechanism holds it tight until you want it and releases it very easily and naturally for you but will not let it go while it s just sitting there check these things out you will not be disappointed also as for durability i have used and abused my hercules stand for years tossing it around my car to play at different places it s been tossed dropped setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when i first bought it it doesn t even have any obvious visible scratches on it it came with a bag but i discarded it and never used it meanwhile i had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before i bought the herc i will only every buy herc stands from now on got them in days and love them so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing when i first saw this item i wondered why is the regular guitar version and the bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and i realized the bass version only has to tune four strings instead of six so it costs less because we don t need to use it as much but then i remembered there are string bass guitars and i thought okay shouldn t they have a one for string bass guitars sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when i realized with some dismay that there are even string bass guitars will this even work on a string bass after all that s more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool its function is three fold string winder string cutter peg pullerso no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably priced tool made by d addario the quality lives up to the brand it s solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed it does everything it s supposed to do does it well and is of good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons the winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use i would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening because of this design flaw stars instead of i note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys what i believe is that it is a mistake to sell the bass and standard guitar version on the same page from what i can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the bass guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity it s obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge the one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn t careful the same holds true for needle nose pliers bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they re doing don t get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using any modification tool i suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings to in seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didn t simply start a new listing when redesigning the device don t let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you this is an awesome pedal ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound it is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don t abuse it to much it should be fine you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price buy this
780	after trying to rig something up i decided to just go with this mount for my yeti it did not disappoint the fit was perfect install was easy use your logic and the microphone looks sexy as hell on it i started doing quite a bit of voiceover work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk after attaching it to a microphone stand i found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the yeti microphone this seemed like the best option for that upon installing the mount i had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you unfortunately if your microphone stand is coming from the sides you have to take the inner ring out rotate it to where you want it and reattach the rubber bands easy enough as i completed this is one minute after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone i see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder this probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings i have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bands going to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a difference it s does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
781	changed the strings on my epiphone eb bass today for the first time using this product fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare cutter works great winder makes the job really fast minutes it took for all strings next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing highly recommended this bag is super cheap and flimsy with almost no protection for your guitars at all but since it s reflected in the cost keeps gear dry not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag i know it says tenor now that i look at it but since i put soprano gig bag into the amazon search i figured i would be getting only soprano bags anyway it doesn t seem much more then a normal gig bag yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not not sure how well it holds a tenor since i don t have one mine is black not the almost purple the image shows
782	this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from the pencil condenser are questionable they have picked up outside noise like birds etc but with a decent bit of white noise but i may have had them running a bit hot too the strange clamps have worked well for me i got two sets of these tunners my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now i love them hi guys really simple little review here this is a windscreen it does windscreen things pros it works it fits my microphonecons the package game a little smushed so it s a little misshapen it s it works if it s not the highest quality stop complaining it s what did you expect kevlar the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cable i bought this for my son so he could record with it he does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him i bought this cord after returning a cheap one that i should ve known better than to buy my son who has some experience as a musician recommended the hosa brand when i was seeking a proper replacement i bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a behringer c condenser microphone and a behringer xenyx mixer and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic the sound quality is excellent an excellent value for the money this is a cheaper alternative to the string swing wall mount considerably less expensive it works fine it s easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well the only downside is that the wall anchors aren t the heavy duty plastic screw in types but the smaller drill a hole and hammer in place types which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others of course you can always purchase a couple of screw in heavy duty mounts and you ll still save considerably this of course doesn t have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing for the lower price you get black plastic but it s sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job if it had sturdier wall mounts i d give it stars as it is the cheaper and less trustworthy mounts bring it stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative it is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw in mounts should hold any size guitar
783	these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand they do need v phanom power from your board or a mic amp i m using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which i will review in more detail later the vdc comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which i will review as a set if you do stereo recording you can t go wrong with these their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear it sounds great and setup outside with db of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away rain drops comming down and sounds you never would hear note never get these wet you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain you will need xlr cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar but you already know that sound quality the bx sounds neutral and balanced compared to similar sized consumer speakers they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs i e teen eq the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours it also lacks a midrange bump and sounds a bit recessed or laid back compared to average earbuds or home speakers in fact the bx sounds similar to my sennheiser hd headphones but with less lower bass and that s a good thing for mixing as you don t want speakers that add color and or bumps in the frequency response unlike typical passive stereo speakers the bx is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer i e bi amped this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver the downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing at first the bx struck me as underpowered for a watt rating at least with a signal directly from my mac pro however once jacked into the hotter signal from my motu ultralite the true power of the bx was revealed it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked these are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out your head should form a triangle with the two speakers that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties so don t buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use i mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings live and multitrack so the bass range is perfect for me the bass extends down to a clear hz so plenty ump for drop d and drop c tuning if you mix bass guitar and kick drum you ll want larger speakers bx or a sub but these are great for guitar i m used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass mid and highs for different room responses and taste oddly the pdf instructions show eq switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure rfi resistance i m an inner city dweller and live in a high rfi area cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes so one of the major selling points for me was m audio s claim of rfi shielding luckily that was no mere marketing jive they really are well shielded against rfi not a single wayward drum loop or dj in my tracks not even when cranked i can t make that claim for prior speakers i ve owned heat these speakers run on the warm side the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions i live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up not a deal breaker but it s wise to turn them off when not in use i use a power strip so i don t have to flip two separate switches construction these are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed cinema display and motu ultralite construction appears very good with dense particle board mdf cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit and matching plastic front molding around the drivers the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl these monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam and the tweeters sport silk domes no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick connections like most studio monitors the bx comes with pro audio style jacks for inch phone plug trs and xlr if you re a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks rca or usb so you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters if you re an experienced recordist you should have plenty of these cables laying around but otherwise be prepared to reach for your wallet one of the things i like about the bx is both the trs and xlr connections are active at the same time allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches i have an audioengine d dac connected to the trs phone input for itunes movies games etc while a motu ultralite for mixing tracking is plugged into the xlr connection last blurb yes the small focal speakers i listened to were better sounding and louder than the bx but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches however a perfect monitor for a home studio isn t only about a good neutral sound but also about compactness appearance and value and the bx nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine fast delivery and exactly as advertised put it to work making music within minutes the steel gives a clearer sound than the glass bottle slides but you need both good product these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch the soundis full and fills the room take some time but it was well worth it i ve always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards this worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before
784	i play guitar i bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago they re very interesting these are soft rubber with a little bit of give so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies similar to using your thumb but not exactly i still pull one of these out every once in awhile in certain applications getting a particular sound for a song say these could be exactly what you re looking for overall these are well made and the ones i bought will probably last me forever but these would never work for me as a main pick i m glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them the industry standard for live performance the sm has withstood the test of time and for good reason these are the only microphones that i perform with and the on off switch makes it easier so i don t have to power down all of my gear when i am done practicing i just turn the mic off i love this tuner it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone i find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord i want to play next i can sing the note into it and then i know which chord i want to play next i had one of these and lost it replaced it with the ns planet waves micro clip on tuner which is not as good this tuner has a better higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too easily worth the extra dollar it s a little taller than the micro but still very small and if it s behind a headstock it doesn t make a difference visually the main difference is the height if the tuner width and depth are about the same that also means a bigger readout so not really a con i use it on a godin with a slotted headstock positioned so i can see it between the tuning keys easy to use bummed i lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner i ll be getting another one of these soon should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it i ve had one of these for about years now i ve made s of picks out of old credit cards gift cards club cards plastic sheets plastic packaging well you get the idea this is fun and easy to do i have even sold the picks at garage sales cents each my favorite cards to use are the itunes gift cards careful cause some of the itunes cards are cardstock they most replicate a fender med pick most credit cards are a bit thicker somewhere between a fender med and heavy they work well also the edges do come out a little rough but i use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily i use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results the best part is i am never without a pick even when people accidentally walk off with one i do get funny looks at the stores when i ask for the used gift cards back until i explain what i do with them then the clerks are like wow thats so cool on average i can get picks from a credit card unless i m going for a particular part of the card with a design on it it takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards but seeing as they are basically free i don t mind wasting parts if i want a particular image just a word of caution on things like dvds or cds they are really too thick and tend to shatter not worth the effort i tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of punches this little guitarlele is great i have tuned to the standard e tuning of a guitar and it manages very well it gives a gently subdued tone that is perfect for playing any time even accompanying music on the tv whilst the family are watching i have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than i had with my twelve string in the last six months added info now that the tuning has settled down it is keeping tune very well with no need to retune during playing the strings it came with are not the best though they are wearing through all ready
785	just put these on my martin dcx e and they sound great this is a big guitar that really rings out and the elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking i can t say if they last longer vine has us review this asap after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning i have used elixir nano web strings before and i do think they keep their tone a bit longer that being said my go to strings are still d addario i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up they are indeed some high tech strings with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability plus they feel and sound good so grab a pack and get jamming you ll definitely want to check these out this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there i play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen it worked but i don t use it anymore you have to get this cap on just right or the strings will buzz i think i ll keep this as a backup and get a better one for my every day use broke one of my snark tuners when i kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided i needed a tuner i could keep on any guitar while it was in any case pros fits on any guitar which then fits in any case cheap accuratecons calibration button and on off button are same shape same size and on the same tiny surface very easy to hit the wrong one not great poor viewing angle for on a side tuners works better for in line tuners not as easy to read as the snarkother thoughts i only use this on a guitar that i play for only one song at shows because the song requires two capos and a detuned string don t ask i much prefer the snark but apparently i can t be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away idiot at shows i rely on a tu stompbox for tuning basically this is a niche tuner it s so stinking small and that s what counts fender guitars are made for tinkering they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws at any given time i have a fender guitar taken apart and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws i inevitably lose don t get me wrong i am a die hard fenderista but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects not fine examples of the luthier s art that s what makes them so much fun to play and modify item is really convienient small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading i like the swivel design swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want price can t be beat either small light and stays out of the way it just works folds up if needed for travel i use with stratacoustic i m just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best i like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound the price is right this is a decent to good little tuner but there are some drawbacks to it also i have the otherplanet waves chromatic headstock tunerto compare this one to here are the pros and cons of this tuner as i see them pros super compact virtually invisible from the front of the guitar adjustable frequency settings top load battery no need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery cons awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock i have a gibson les paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it less gradation in setting than other tuners the gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning debatable clip mechanism not spring loaded this means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar one battery this unit takes only one battery versus two with the other when it boils down to it i prefer my old planet waves tuner it seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning using both at the same time and i like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry in fact i can easily recommend that tuner main drawback is that that one eats batteries this tuner is more catered to fender style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on for those players bump up this review to or and half stars for others i highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning it has many features i have yet to utilize but good to know they are there if needed i ve tried these out in head to head excuse the pun runs versus steelseries plantronics panasonic and sony headphones that all cost more and the tascam th keeps up i m really surprised at how well they perform lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp yes the lows could be a bit beefier but out of the headphones i compared it to only the plantronics excelled in that area for fit i have a large noggin like size hat and these headphones fit well not too tight snug but not confining the padding is good and soft seriously i d rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break which they haven t and i ve taken them everywhere than spend on another set i thought i was getting something that would boost amplify the signal from my bass to the amp it didn t but at it s cheap price it wasn t bad and i found other uses for it they make ones that will boost the signal so if that s what you re looking for be a careful consumer the ns mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi octave range of electric bass guitar and mandolin the accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button the tuner s view window is slightly larger than a chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly lit spaces one thing that s less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself if you ve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean i d wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing a lighter color may work better the notes appear red when out of tune their color changes to green as a rough marker you then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note they ve gone to lengths to make the tuner stage friendly but i d much prefer the green color mean fine tuned and done that way i can look from a distance i should only have to bother with the bars if i m struggling to home in and in my experience that s the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by new strings slack under the bridge pins a slipping tuner etc mid life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably so long as you don t use a lot of altered tunings the ns is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back i m a lefty and unlike some other tuners i appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right side up the viewer doesn t extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my l with large new yorker style tuners on headstocks with more bare wood like a strat or even my a style mandolin it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn t obstruct my hand while turning keys at first i didn t like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock i could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like i needed two to remove it one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out after a little practice however i found this wasn t the case and the touch required isn t difficult at all the tuner s constructed in a high impact composite similar to those parachute style clamps you see on backpacks it feels durable and very unlikely to break although i didn t try stomping on it i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag the battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin the tuner has an auto shutoff function to preserve battery life the power and frequency buttons are just nibs really i d prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them the tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from to if doesn t work for you one advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren t limited to usually diatonic open strings for myself i only use tuners to set the pitch of one string usually the low a for guitar or bass and low g for mandolin in my opinion tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics and neither does the job well intonation is subject to a bunch of variables string action and thickness neck relief fret condition nut and bridge condition once i have a single string to pitch i match fretted and open string unisons and octaves after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument i used to love staring at those pignose sized strob a tuners sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately i wish many more did i m not quite sure how we went from we tune because we care to i m so embarrassed to be standing here tuning i hope no one notices but the ns mini headstock tuner questionable design choices and all does what it says with a minimum of fuss i want to like this more but it s not as good as my other tuners tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not as easy as the little round ones from snark i like those better and they re cheaper i have at least of these i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport holds acoustic or electric good quality stable economical i have read that the foam padding can react with nitrocellulose lacquer and mar the instruments finish i haven t seen that on my older stands but to error on the side of caution i have glued thin leather to the back and lower support of the stands it is working fine i bought the first about years ago it is still like new works like a champ i only have four pedals on it thus far but i haven te had any problems no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldn t handle the load i still have open leads for those other pedals smile my power strip now has more space for other toys to make my weak playing sound better after years of using a diagonal pliers this small and secure to use around top line guitar bases this guys just made my none stewmac tool in my tool set i love this thing it quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument i own electric acoustic guitars electric acoustic bass guitars it clips on securely is easy to see stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on off from the front you can barely notice it at all i just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed when i switch to another instrument i un clip it and take it with me to what ever i want to play next i love this thing love it love it love it first i ve noticed that many reviews here are for the original ns tuner the one with only two buttons and coin slot battery cover this one is a little smaller has a metronome flasher and the battery installs differently but the name model evidently didn t change i compared this new one the original and the latest snark on dreadnought guitar mandolin and string banjo pros size size and size reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some cons display not as bright as otherscontrary to their description this one seems less sensitive than original battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks on my wife s a style mandolin it fits but barely on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits that being said i haven t found anything i can t use it on my take the snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy lock in speed and visibility however i really dislike the eyeball on a stick form factor and refuse to use it on stage i like the fact that the ns is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument i even in leave em on in the case the display and lock in speed of the original ns was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me i ll keep the new ns tuners for now and hope that d adarrio or someone improves on it with a better processor and led this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole it would not work for an f hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides the dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly don t push it all the way in after moistening and you won t have a problem i drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the d and g strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole they can t be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings i ve never had one of these move from where i left it if the sponge isn t dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case when the humidity is very low or less the sponge dries out in to days even if the case isn t opened as with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days if you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar or don t want to see one use a guitar humidifier especially during the winter heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels between and is ideal for most guitars air conditioning can do the same for especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar s is okay for many reasons it s always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use a humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly it s a nice little amp for practice it lacks volume and low end for performance i have used it for several months with no problems this is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify foot stomping percussion traditional to french canadian music the base is really heavy which makes it stay in place well but it s a pain to carry around also since buying this i found out that i could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet which would have been a bit cheaper for a good basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings it s difficult to go wrong with d addario s exl s the range of thicknesses generally works well and d addarios tend to be pretty consistent some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the exl s e g coating super brightness and so on and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string e g sets that start with s or s but for most purposes these work great hold their tuning well and seem to last pretty well too i was honestly skeptical before actually trying it the specs seemed as if it would support my very heavy very expensive hand made x cabinet and matching head it seemed the only design that would allow me to tilt back the pair and it absolutely delivered the upright support in the back extends quite a bit and the protective foam is moveable and can be positioned at just the right location i am truly impressed and after using this weekend after weekend with a gigging band can soundly recommend this product this tuner is tiny and works as advertised to tune my guitar bass and banjo i have tested it against other older and larger tuners and all tune to the same accuracy which is very good i docked it one star because the screen doesn t stay on in my opinion long enough when i am trying to tune a string when i pick a string the screen flashed for a brief second with the tuning information and then goes blank it works but i find other tuners easier to use that have screens that stay on longer with each pick perhaps a more experienced guitar play may only need that brief flash of tuning information to tune a screen but for me i find it easier to have the tuning information displayed longer also this tuner is tiny i can leave it on my instrument when i put the instrument in a case no problem at all the flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too really tiny almost hard to read tiny you need to decide if this tiny size is an advantage or disadvantage for you one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ i like the old version more these are a little tricky to mount but do track well and are not obnoxious looking like the snark tuners the device itself is difficult to read in bright light my first one arrived not working at all the second one arrived with a low battery what after three days the battery goes out i would have returned it but lost it because it doesn t adhere to the headstock very well you ve been warned this is my guitar pick of choice i fits well in my hand and is well balanced have tons of picks but seem to use this one all the time i bought the two pack and i ve found them both to be a bit finicky sometimes they turn on right away and other times you have to click the button a couple times to get it to light up when they re on and working they work well and i like the small size and tight profile against the headstock i just wish they were a little more reliable i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out they are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune they seem slower to lock then my snark tuners and the visual scale is not as precise but they do seem to work fairly well the ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars and they can be stored in the case attached its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it update downgrading my rating by star having used four ns microtuners for a couple of weeks on four different instruments i have to say that in comparison to my snark tuners the ns micro tuner is slow to lock and difficult to tune precisely with the snark any of them i have several models i can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds with the ns microtuners i have to repeatedly pluck a string and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment sometimes i have to pluck a string several times before the ns microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target e would be a perfectly tuned e but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort i still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check but when i want to be precise and fast i always reach for the snark i was expecting something a little bigger it will do but next time i probably will look for something with a little more stability works great with my fender super camp x easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response small light and compact great product i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner not sure if i lost it at a gig or my three year old son got his hands on it i d bet the latter this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice that s about the only pro there are a few other features i guess like being able to select the instrument used but i don t need that cons the readout is smaller duh but does not seem to be as bright i play a lot of outdoor weddings in bright sun and this one is much harder to read than the mini this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini as you move closer to in tune the bars do not smoothly move towards the center so it s easy to over or under tune and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done and those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you re trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect i m also trying to tune my semi acoustic guitar as quietly as possible so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option does it get the job done yes but there is a product that s almost the same size that works a little better for a negligible price difference it might even be cheaper if you re a beginner and want to select the instrument you re tuning and a few extra seconds isn t an issue or you play in dark environments and don t need a super bright readout this will be fine but i will be going with the mini when i buy a new one update we received a replacement for this item it does everything it was advertised to do and it performs quite well although the clip on the new one doesn t grip as well as the first the device tunes within ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner our thanks to d addario for their assistance in satisfying this customer please check our reviews we review regularly and rarely have anything poor to say about products unfortunately we cannot remain positive with this device our small band keeps an average of instrument tuners at the ready we have several ns models that work flawlessly as well as tg models that we really like this one seems to consume coin cell batteries at an unacceptable rate on average it eats a battery a day it also has a much darker display making it hard to read unless the stage is quite dark one would think that if the display were darker less power would be drawn from the battery average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner we do like the ability to rotate the display so that the tuner can be mounted in front or behind the headstock with the display maintaining proper orientation unfortunately the poor performance means that this unit will find its way into the junk drawer on the workbench i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar metallic silver sizeand what a difference in sound these strings seriously rock i also use d addario strings on my ukulele and i ve had great luck with those they withstand a lot of play and i don t have to replace them often the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder definitely recommended how much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand first it a great price about the same as a big mac lol second it fits great does exactly what it s supposed to do third now that i use a pick holder i wonder why i never did so before i do have a tendency to break drop or even wear out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency i have some solid heavier weighted stands that stand up to a quick grab of a pick from this holder but when using one of my cheaper lighter tripod style stands i make sure i m careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so i don t pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick great product couldn t live without it lol and it s not the manufacturer s fault i have some cheap light weight stands if you re looking for a pick holder i can t think of any reason not to try this one i have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body people watching me can t really see it and it s right where i need it full of picks if i drop one wonderful little invention buy it if you don t want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket i ll be upfront and honest right away and say that i m not the biggest fan of headstock tuners i love the idea but usually i feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired but when this popped up on my vine newsletter i thought i d give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things i don t like about the other ones cough snark cough a little background first i guess i ve been playing guitar for the last years and i currently have two other tuners i have a little korg plug in type where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up i also have a boss tu pedal tuner if i m jamming with friends or playing a show the tu is what i ll use to stay in tune its very durable and accurate and i like how i can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal so i can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and or the audience for home practice i use the korg as i usually tune up before i start playing then just plug into my practice amp and blast away the korg is nice and accurate easy enough to use for alternate tunings and in years of having it around including in and out of jam sessions before buying the tu i ve only had to buy one replacement i first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue snark that everyone seems to have these days he was not incredibly pleased with it not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn t exatly easy to tune up with it while i thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something i d want on my headstock enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves does it fix the problems that made the snark so unappealing to my friend and me accuracy it does seem to tune accurately that s a good thing and it already puts this ahead of the snark its not easy to use for alternate tunings however so do keep that in mind also the letters take some getting used to as they use that kind of chunky lcd block style that you find on some dvd players not a huge complaint but it isn t as idiot proof as my korg or tu looks ease of use it s quite a bit more subtle than the snark able to hide behind your headstock which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar the only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a les paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen my lp copy has the larger grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock i wear my guitar fairly low so i was able find an area where i can see it from the top down but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck those with fender style headstocks should have no problem though it ll work great for them also it is plenty bright so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue durability this is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are the snark is very easy to break as it rests on a small ball joint this planet waves mini isn t going to lose its head too easy but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and i don t expect it to hold up under too much use the tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session i still think it would be easy enough to break i haven t had it long enough for this to happen yet so i can only give you my initial impressions let s just say this i d never gig with this guy as my only tuner its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark however headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they re gonna work for everyone anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner i personally suggest a boss tu or tu or a korg pitchblack i know they re more expensive but you ll be happier off in the long run those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session this is a nice option but it may not hold up forever i ll probably stick to my tu and my korg plug in but as headstock tuners go this is nicer than most i ve been using these for years tried others but i prefer these i d allways come back to d addario s they just sound good i m satisfied this tuner is tiny and accurate initially the instructions were somewhat puzzling to me because there were no diagrams next to the instructions for example the instructions read press the tuner s release lever to open the tuners ratchet clamp uh ok i had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked after i figured it out i d have to say that i don t like this mechanism i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp but i do like the rotation of the display as for tuning i had difficulty tuning the low e string on my travel sized guitar as a previous reviewer mentioned the display jumps around a lot even with the tip of plucking the string with a light to moderate stroke for my full sized guitar the tuning was easier but i had some difficulty on the low e string tuning my concert ukulele was relatively easy except for tuning the e string again proved to be more effort just for fun i tuned a full sized cello with great results but there was no easy way to clamp the tuner on another experiment i ran was checking out the tuner in a room with another instrument playing after tuning the instruments i checked the tuning against another tuner and the mini tuner was spot on although concealing the tuner from my audience isn t a concern of mine i would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me great sound over the original strings i did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size they will draw blood if your not careful so watch it while replacing the small strings the g and the d were fine cool little digital tuner that works great on my ukulele small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners i like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance highly recommended very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and don t want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find i must have had over tuners in the last few decades and the snark is by far my favorite i change out altered capos every few songs so i have to tweak the tuning many times each gig and this has made it much easier even in noisy clubs with poor lighting i have been playing guitar off on for about years i have always used whatever cheap picks i could find laying around or snagged from music shops the free ones they give you when you try out a guitar in the shop always medium gauge for both acoustic and electric i decided to try these dava s because they were cheap and looked cool wasn t expecting much i mean a pick is a pick right wrong these little guys have a fantastic feel to them they seem to get in between the strings so effortlessly for flat picking it s crazy but that is what i am experiencing they are maybe a bit on the thin side but not overly so i got used to them quick plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking tone wise they produce a nice crisp slightly metallic string sound which i rather like i recorded some with them today and it was perhaps a bit on the loud side with regards to the audible pick attack on the strings on the acoustic a breedlove c but not bad and i was using a sensitive rode condenser haven t played much with them on my electric yet customized fender stratocaster but i m sure they will be fine there as well i like these picks a lot and am ordering a dozen more to keep around good stuff this little simple looper sure is a ton of fun beware that there is a learning curve to looping with trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while i m a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback could be better i use this mainly with a double neck bass guitar compliments well
786	i have already laid down tracks and the process is effortless easy export to protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago recently i noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp after tracing the issue i discovered there was some play in the strat s jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip a quick fix was to bend the jack s connector end but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open making a minor gap where there wasn t that positive connection i ve purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials it s a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection obviously because the finish is chromed oxidation can get in the way of the connection but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied if oxidation wear is an issue switchcraft makes gold plated jacks however i just love these jacks and for the price they really can t be beat if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button these are great buttons to use it comes with two buttons two washers and screws two different sizes this is a quality stand i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great nothing but praise for this item excellent strap for the money the leather is thick and supple in fact the materials are so thick that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup a note about length some might find the standard levy s strap length too short so be aware what you need and note there are xl versions of these for me many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me including those from franklin dunlop bmf wide and mono even the short model was about an inch too long i m a bass player and when standing i prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height a few basses i prefer higher i d suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable measure button hole to button hole and be sure you re ordering the right length hosa cable gtr guitar instrument cable ft is a high quality instrument cable but low cost won t break the bank i m very satisfied with my purchase brilliant solution to the strap button problem the pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won t slip off works as well as locking strap buttons did for me solid tuner more accurate than i anticipated and very easy to use it will get you extremely close and for the size and functionality it seems to be the best product of it s kind that i ve used
787	just what i needed for my home studio monitors that sit on the table next to my computer and my daw system was surprised at how many different versions i was sent they all work well thanks heaps bought because cheap and trying to keep my electric guitar strings in good shape if i decide to pick it up again
788	if you buy a ukulele and it does not have these strings you should replace them with these strings strings make a big difference in any ukulele i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin it works well for all of them and is inexpensive i ve been playing rock and blues for over years i ve owned a number of amps over the years including a s ampeg watt combo and a pre cbs watt fender showman and my latest a crate watt tube amp that i bought about years ago i also have a small peavy watt solid state combo the crate has always sounded great and it s what i use exclusively in my basement studio but it weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out despite numerous repair attempts so i ve been using the peavy when i play out the last time i did i was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else i own a line pocket pod and love it so i looked into the line amps when i found that i could get a watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than i could go through in a lifetime for less than i ordered one from amazon sight unseen and unheard out of the box i was amazed at just about everything the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich the effects that i have played around with so far are amazing and i cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole spider iv and the thing is loud very loud as i get more experience with the amp i m sure that i m going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome i m sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a watt solid state combo with speaker as their main amp and if you ve got to spend and a roadie i guess they d be right but for the money the sound the size and the very light weight lbs alone make this a fabulous deal add in the modeling and the effects high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves and compared to my crate vc at the spider iv seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function i doubt that i will use my crate again except when guests come to jam and then the less than good it doesn t come with a foot switch you have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and or take advantage of the channels on the fly and to upload new firmware to the amp and of course you really want to do all if that and more so a foot controller is essential i opted for the fbv express mk ii the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal it lets me access all channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume wah controller it was another it is really essential so in my mind the price of the spider iv is really just under and it doesn t come with any manuals to speak of all the manuals are available online for free but of course you have to download them and print them and these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp if you do not have access to a computer and a printer i guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not i guess you re sol the advanced guide is the essential one for using the amp and is only pages long that s too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail and it s not particularly well written there a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another pages long i have not explored it much yet but i suspect that it will be written similarly once again if you do not have a computer with an internet connection there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the spider iv that you will not be able to do my guess is that it would have probably added to the list price of the amp for line to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual and at the amp would seem less attractive to many so line opted to handle things the way they did bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal very highly recommended jm tepper while this hanger is not unattractive and is well built i could and will modify it to better suit my needs the design of the hanger causes the neck of the uke to stand off of the wall inches at the head and inches at the hanger itself and inches at the base of the body this is not an easy fix but it is doable
789	great deal for the price works fine but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric did the job for what i needed now i know i would love a better one like a fishman got the mics from dealer fast i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good i haven t had much chance to play it but so far so good it seems like it is good quality this guitar is probably one of the best i have ever owned the tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings you might need to adjust the neck a bit and some new strings probably wouldn t hurt but my god what an amazing guitar this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric i did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close this unit works as advertised i ve used it to record my garage band shows making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds e g audience and any other background noise so if you want a more pure sound you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments microphones etc good thing i didn t trust the plastic anchors i put a bit of weight on it the screws came out of the anchors the anchors stayed in the wall i found a stud it works looks fine good inexpensive guitar hangers i m getting a few more low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming for the price it is a good deal what can i say they are ernie ball slinky strings i ve been using slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for years and they have never let me down unlike some of the higher priced strings i might add very responsive and never dull or weak sounding crisp highs and smooth lows that don t get mudded out i would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and ernie ball super slinkys on your electric guitar still after all of these years and innovations in strings ernie ball still gets my vote hands down
790	i ve been playing mostly acoustics over years i own a d martin epiphone dr zager zad american fender strat gibson studio les paul and have owned many others when my little red traveler showed up at my door i was excited but my expectation bar wasn t set too high i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made neck was perfect just the slightest bow frets were finished better than my gibson when i bought it i found some wet dry sand paper i think grit and spent about minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone wow the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality no buzz perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play the tone is unique not quiet and unless you are expecting martin sound definitely not offensive the sound is kind of acoustic guitar ukulele banjo ish i m thinking with a nice pickup it would make quite nice unique a acoustic lead instrument plays great to the top fret love it unbelievable instrument a pleasure play oh and the case is a freebee buy one be happy one last thing another post mentioned putting your right arm outside the strap and tying between the tuning keys that works well i used these on all my instruments guitar mandolin and violin it works fine and i would recommend them at this good price i could not beat the price the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal it is well build and i can use it on other boss and roland gear also it not to big it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board very happy with this item it fit my american vintage s strat my guitar had an hole pickguard i ordered an hole pickguard and it fit like a glove the guitar is ply plastic black white black this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like i am happy with the purchase bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp and i think they improved the sound over the original eh ones these are considered boutique tubes but i think they re popular for a reason
791	sounds great easy to adjust nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board worth price hands down this is a very basic delay pedal with the obvious knobs delay volume time and repeats it has a nice bright sound never too muddy and it s perfect for some dave gilmour style slap back delays it only works with a power adapter no battery this has its pros and cons on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less on the other side if your power adapter breaks you re out of luck unlike many similar pedals this one doesn t let you set infinite repeats this makes it impossible to make tricks a la johnny greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises this is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals so i returned it nonetheless the product itself is great cheap sturdy and it does exactly what it s supposed to do works very smoothly and doesn t eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners we have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a pack for yep a buck i m sold on these and will be getting another as soon as i need one this amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single inch speaker it sounds great right out of the box the overdrive channels amp models are some of the best i ve heard from modelers pedals etc not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and i havent even looked at the fuse software yet i am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes if you mic up this will work for small gigs the build seems very good i don t think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price just got it so far so good i use delay pretty light n tight slapback vibe not too wet this does it well i considered the mxr delay no i may have considered it but the only pedal failure i ve ever experienced was my mxr dunlop phase first the dc input then the stomp switch after light barely any bedroom use this modtone here seems solidly constructed i haven t played with it too much yet but as of right now i wouldn t recommend it for edge wannabes seems limited in that regard i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes no we do not good tone though does the trick trick
792	good design easy to hang on to these picks reasonable price makes it even better i don t often use picks but when i do i use these i will buy more in the future this stand is very good nice and strong i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this it is worth a lot more then dollars this will last a life time and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash so i looked for something better and i am so happy to have found this at this price i didn t want to pay more then dollars for a stand but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for or dollars and in months its in the trash i would be buying another one so really this is the best deal i am so happy i bought this stand you can t go wrong with this one realy get it it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over its heavy enough not to it slides up and down nicely and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well bolts are not plastic witch is nice and very easy to put together and fast i got it together in one minute i only used regular pliers to put it together the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument i truly recommend this for anyone i did get the foot guards for to protect floor on carpet you will not need them and it comes with a year warranty and with the free shipping you can t beet it no matter the weight selections i ve found the ernie ball slinky series a worthy pairing for my acoustics theyy re responsive and twangy not my favorite pick but pretty close they are solid and haven t dropped one yet i wish someone would make a grippy texture pick with a hole in it too spectraflex makes great cables i bought this right angle red cable for my older ibanez guitar this cable is built to be extremely durable is made in the usa and comes with a lifetime warrantee the gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial especially compared to a cheaper fender cable i had been using that required almost constant tightening though spectraflex cables are not the least expensive nor the most expensive they are a great value and i am definitely a fan i recommend this cable without reservations
793	i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use i own the old ibanez ts that i modified to the original keeley specs side by side there is a difference but i only use it for my rehearsal rig this is the first pedal i ve had to actually read the manual in order to figure out how to install the battery the instructions tell you to use a ball point pen to press in the hinge pins in order to remove the foot switch cover i laugh when ever i hear about the holy grail ic chip when i modified my ts i found that chip at mouser for cents a piece it was a net order and i felt weird ordering so i ordered they send a pound catalogue every month because of that purchase the behringer to is a cheap alternative to the original if you re on a budget and will do in a pinch the civilians won t notice the difference lifesaver i bought this and a planet wave s o port which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well i use this at every show where i have to plug in this is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn t want to worry about feedback this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does holding my ipad i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice great product highly recommend i had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy so i wanted something that would grip the ipad this stand does the trick i don t have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand some people have said that it s not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position i have not found that to be true since i ve had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic because of the way that i stand with my guitar it s hard for me to see the thing when i use the clamp kind this one uses the mic clip treads and because it s on it s own stand i can put it anywhere at any height and see the ipad the only drawback is you can t have your ipad in a case or you have to find a case that s ultra thin otherwise it s great
794	so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one what i can say with over years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low price i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion see my other reviews on these pedals basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween it is built solidly and looks roadworthy it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great is it of the same caliber as a boutique pedal no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price i would have no issue gigging with this unit the distortion is warm with the tone at with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available lots of sounds in this unit and very very quiet nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned for classic rock this is perfect maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatoverall no concerns with this great product it s hard to really describe what this pedal does it doesn t distort flange echo or produce a chorus i d heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it and because words don t do an accurate job in describing it i would have probably never pulled the trigger on one even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go as luck would have it i acquired one on trade and i have to admit that i agree with the whole blanket euphemism this stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my blues jr when placed at the end of my pedaltrain right before i run into the amp i don t feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp s tone though i do believe it works even better in a loop i placed it in the effects loop of both a palomino v usa ampeg made and a crate vc a watt usa made el tube amp with celestian speaker and it was transformative to both amps tone in a great way it does very well with single coils it s a pedal that i would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in i don t think it works as well when i run my lp into a jet city combo particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures harmonics that amp also lacks an effects loop and i imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase i guess it s rig dependent but it s a keeper for what it does to the sound of my fender the pyle battery powered pa system with wireless microphone is surprisingly well made and has features i would have expected on much more expensive equipment we run workshops often at our customer s locations and needed a portable pa system that could easily be transported and doesn t require a lot of power here are my observations long battery life worked for over hours straight but can be connected to ac to work as well wireless microphone built into the system has good range and acceptable sound battery included inputs for microphones guitar and audio connection each with it s own volume control portable built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy includes a mini plug to converter a handy accessory includes echo effect a fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice my kids loved playing with this note my unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work this unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit highly recommended as another guy said not better not bad simply different it s true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not like dunlop has a little bit of more wah range than behringer i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it more expensive than the behringer to my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer cheaper does not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparent more features than dunlop wha sound is not like the dunlop s it is different but nice i personally like so bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic good deal just get it i highly recommend it thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt good plenty of gain on hand lots of sustain this thing can get really loud it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch built well it s casing is made out of metal not plastic inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing times as much if you re lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal forget the boss ds andget this one well worth the money bad adds a little noise hiss specially to single coils strats teles you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise quieter with humbuckers but hums when i use it with my xotic ep booster whichi always keep on it doesn t happen when i boost my overdrives ocd hardwire cm if you move farther away from your amp the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise i guess this is typical for distortion boxes no need to boost it though it already has that thick big sound to start with it didn t come with a v battery as shipped not a big deal cause i use a poweradapter anyway this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me but i see that most are the same as a pop filter it works perfectly and i was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring just pop filtering through black pantyhose lol this is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your fender mustang amp it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised this switch is not bulletproof but works great for playing around with your small practice amp this is a clone of the boss compressor and works just as well as far as i have been able to tell as the original being the owner of both i would have to say if you re not too stuck up about brands then i would go with this if you like the boss cs but many people say that bosses compressor is not that good i know some compressors do seem to be a little more natural sounding however that is just preference it does what it needs to chicken picking or just crispening up your sound its plastic but nothing is unbreakable so use some sense don t hit it with a hammer or jump on it and you ll not break it i ve had no problems with behringer but heard great things the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow this pedal i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin wow it cranks it really will produce marshall plexi tones especially noticeable in the lower registers on the e and a strings if you want a marshall stack sound this is it if you wanty a variety i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions so you can chose any amp sound you need really people for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make and they all are super a bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews plugging it in and playing it for minutes one can see it has tons of gain on tap it responds well to the guitars volume knob it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love the pedal cuts through and is articulate it s not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock think ac dc and van halen to metallica it s a classic rock pedal that screams buy it this pedal is very easy to use retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied if you re not familiar with ehx s signature distortion fuzz pedal the big muff please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out describing its sound with words helps but doesn t really do it justice it definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you ll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand they re one of my very favorite effects honestly so for this review i m going to focus more on how the little big muff stacks up against the other models for starters this version takes care of all of the common complaints regarding the nyc reissue its true bypass its much smaller not super tiny like a boss but a little slimmer than say the wider mxr pedals like the phase it uses a normal v adapter jack thank you finally it sounds better yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has this one is smoother not as creamy as the russians but it also doesn t suck tone like that one does either its a touch higher gain than both the russians and the tone wicker versions but all in all it absolutely is a big muff so if you re in the market for one of these and you don t want the options the tone wicker muff provides this is absolutely where its at its better in every way than the ny reissue also it costs less money yay i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from there is no difference in the sound at all this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in a box it does s hair band and s metal very well if you re looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic plexi or brown sound get the joyo british it nails those sounds well just be aware that the ends are so big that some vertical input boxes like my danelectro fish and chips can t be used with these cables because the input and output are too close together it really pains me to give anything but a star review to a boss product since i m such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall those compliments apply equally to the cs compression sustainer and it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less reliable brand in my signal chain however there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know the two most common complaints that i see are that it adds noise to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit the former complaint is probably true though if you re enough of a hobbyist to use a compression sustainer you re probably already contemplated using a noise gate suppressor such as the boss ns problem solved as for the latter complaint changes tone that s also true but it s not necessarily a bad thing if you like the tone that results the whole point of the cs is that it s supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it this can result in a muddy neutered tone though you can play with the tone and other settings to help it i also find that with the settings all at o clock the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings really while boss pedals are considered to be expensive compared to many of the other effects out there the cs should really be viewed as a budget or entry level compressor when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a keeley compressor costing north of the best thing you can say about the boss even compared to the similarly priced mxr options is that the cs gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price the biggest negative of the pedal in my opinion is that the resulting sound might seem a little too compressed but there are a lot of things you could do with a cs and it works best paired with other pedals chorus delay some distortions that you re trying to smooth out ultimately it s a pedal that could have been better though there aren t too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of anyway
795	i own over a dozen overdrive pedals i know that is just insane this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads it does a great job tons of tonal options if i were to buy one od pedal it would be this or a barber i ve had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap durable and reasonably accurate i own several different tuners and what i like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it at ten dollars i think it s a no brainer it s the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own i m a string rock bass player that has purchased a lot of overdrive and fuzz pedals most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass they typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end don t provide enough dynamics or don t provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive this incredible inexpensive box really nails it you get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking the downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff the frosted side of me loves that i saved a lot of money buying this ripoff maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it this thing is great in theory but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesn t have a guitar resting in it it does well at its job when it s in use i e it doesn t fall when there s a guitar but i think i ll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it s lying in wait running to pedals on my board this was a logical choice of power the single transformer running into the board with the multi plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board there is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak further with the transformer being well away from the board there is zero ac hum what s not to like here i needed a phaser and saw that the joyo vintage phaser was rated well and super cheap so i bought it i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals this was one of their top rated pedals so i figured i d give it a go i have to say that i am fairy impressed i get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box anything from a light fuzz to a vintage style high gain you won t get a modern metal crunch from it so if that s what you re looking for look elsewhere if you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the s and s then this is a great bet this pedal is currently plugged in and i suspect that i ll keep it as part of my rig unless i happen to get rich and find a nicer boutique pedal or get around to modding my other pedals as a reference i own several boss distortion over drive pedals japanese ds sd od and mt i the joyo jf and od are the two drive pedals that i have hooked up since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that i currently own a side note for the tone freaks the peddle does seem to be a bit muddy it s great for jamming out power chords but not so articulate when you re arpeggiating chords still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp this is a really nice strap it s very thick and feels like it s well made and high quality for a non bank breaking price on a strap looks cool and vintage i am a fan of many dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all these are exactly what the doctored ordered i have one setup to mic my guitar amp and another setup to mic my voice for doing guitar video exchanges they are excellent quality for the money great microfiber polishing cloth for a great price paid less than half through amazon comgreat product that works very well with nitro finishes i bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and i love it i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar i have a vfe alpha dog and an mxr custom badass od before the pedal after the pedal i use an mxr phase and flanger vfe blueprint delay and then a byang triverb when all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when i am not going through a more traditional amp rig buy the pedal it s great jf omfg no need to get all ocd about emptying your full wallet to get the tone needed i tried this on strats an lp a harrington through my slightly modded vc webber speakers tube amp clean channel no hum noisiness built solid the english instructions aren t really useful as the pedal itself is self explanatory i m possibly half deaf but have been doing this for years i ll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens there are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it your attitude and hands create the sound in the end a pedal does not make you play better practice does if you are familiar with the ocd or can get one and a b side by side it you ll be amazed cool looking pedal box to boot this pedal is remarkable for useful tones the sound may not be for everyone but i already have a boogie for the really metal like distortion i needed something that was different but still usable and i feel this pedal fills the bill the low price tag didn t hurt my feelings either this is a win win buying decision as far as i am concerned years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless i ve had this for nearly a year and i have no complaints works perfectly sounds awesome lots of gain tons more than my boss sd w the monte allums sd mod if lost or stolen i d buy another highly recommended compression is possibly one of the most misunderstood pedal or rack effects for guitar players but i can say confidently that the mxr custom comp gets it right and makes it easy what it does first a quick word about compression the easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitar s pure tone when you play an uncompressed guitar signal you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively on the other side of the problem you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous ringing effect but find that the individual notes die out too soon a quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them it also can sustain the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away depending on the settings build quality if there are complaints to be had about the mxr custom comp they aren t related to durability mxr pedals like boss pedals are built with heavy duty metal yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed unlike boss pedals the switch is in the form of a metal button that clicks when you press it my understanding from veteran mxr users is that the switch is very reliable and long lasting in my case however i intend on having the thing on all the time so this is not a major concern anyway one gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal attack control the pedal has knobs for output volume and sensitivity basically amount of compression the attack knob which is found on some rival compressors has to do with the degree of pick attack sound you want when you first hit the note and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly but on the mxr custom comp you need to remove the back plate phillips screws and adjust the attack know with a screwdriver you also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery though i ve switched to a power adapter daisy chain onespot for my pedals anyway so yes it s an inconvenience but with this type of effect it s not like you would want to adjust the attack the way you would mess with tone or gain on a distortion pedal i consider this also to be a non issue tone sound quality the sound quality of this effect is outstanding it is far more transparent than other pedals i ve tried in terms of retaining the tonal characteristics of my guitar but leveling everything out for a great finishing touch whereas i used to think of compression as an effect i would turn on for a specific type of tone i could envision always leaving this effect on with the mxr custom comp it simply makes my underlying clean tone and other effects more manageable and better sounding comparison to other pedals the toughest question to ask about the mxr custom comp is whether it is worth the extra money the top end professional compressors keeley pedals rack units etc are usually north of which isn t practical for a casual player boss makes the cs compression sustainer which is the pedal i traded in for the custom comp the cs is more affordable about to new and more customizable with knobs on the exterior of the pedal adding attack and sustain it definitely does the job in terms of adding sustain and might make sense if you only want to play around with compression from time to time but much like with mxr s entry level compressor the dyna comp in the red casing it simply isn t up to the quality of this pedal advice while compression doesn t color your guitar tone the way a distortion pedal does it s arguably as important to your overall tone quality as any other pedal if you re interested in compression and want the best option at an affordable price i recommend the custom comp at or less on amazon or used on ebay where i ve seen it go for about to it may not be necessary for everyone but very few people who try it will come away disappointed turn it on play with the settings for a minute or two and then leave it on and strum away i have two delay pedals both inexpensive this one and a behringer and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap behringer the danelectro sounds more natural the behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal which is perfectly ok for some applications the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos the case is plastic but unless you eat times your weight at the golden corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet you re not going to break it the only thing i don t like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it i suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the retro look of this pedal ok fine i ve heard pedals costing twice as much that don t sound as nice as this one as one reviewer once wrote there are guitarists who would rather catch aids than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board i however think some of these cheap pedals function quite well and in some cases just as well as their more expensive counterparts if you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your holy grail ocd and other boutique pedals i promise the other ones won t catch aids from this in fact the whole ensemble will benefit put this through an ac c and prepare to be amazed never owned an ocd but i don t need to my neighbors i m sure are not pleased many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point it s your guitar on steriods crisp deplication of it with bass treble and a little hair on it that s at the gain setting flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls from nasty blues to steppenwolf you will have it covered you can never have too many delays so i pulled the trigger i was shocked at how good it sounds not just for the money but over all it s won a spot on my pedalboard and i m picky i admit i got this from guitar center on clearance but over the past week or so i ve had it i just love plugging into it i ve got a great vintage larger amp but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions and i m anticipating spending some time in apartment living so i was looking for a small tube based amp this thing gives great tone with both a strat and a les paul clone and an overdrive pedal works very well with it of course it s not too loud that s the whole point i should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps don t have but it s really low volume also the tubes do take a minutes to warm up and since it doesn t have a standby switch you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in but it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears or those of anyone else great little amp
796	you really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone i was able to sort of dial in a nice marshall s alt rock sound but when you re not playing it can have a noisy wind like feedback coming from your amp but it can vary from amp to amp you can fiddle with the voice and drive knobs to clear it up but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound but to be perfectly honest it s pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than this thing rocks unlike other cheap chinese made ripoffs ahem behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny i bought this with the idea i was getting a pedal that would give me usable marshall amp sounds after trying for a couple of hours i find that it won t do that i guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn t meant to be used with this pedal the guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control he was spot on about that very annoying effect nothing but praise goes to the supplier kdm distributors they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country but the pedal itself not for me they are a wonderful product the lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar with these you can t go wrong fyi parchment is slightly off white unless you re comparing right next to a pure white pickguard you probably would think they re simply white been playing over yearsowned it all or times pedals out the wazoothis is the cats meow if you want a marshall in a boxset your amp up cleanspend minutes finding the sweet spotplay till your fingers hurt i own the tech britishdid a side by sidecan hear no differencei dialed in the early vh brown sound in minutesand thats where i left itcleans up with the vol knobresponds well to pick attackdo not hesitate this pedal is a winner
797	this works well a few cons it is not variable speed on off in either direction with full torque not so bad but variable speed would have been nice it is a little loud other than that does what it should as expected this stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great i m going to be switching to a stand rack soon for all my basses but i will still keep this around because it holds up well love the all black look as well jf omfg no need to get all ocd about emptying your full wallet to get the tone needed i tried this on strats an lp a harrington through my slightly modded vc webber speakers tube amp clean channel no hum noisiness built solid the english instructions aren t really useful as the pedal itself is self explanatory i m possibly half deaf but have been doing this for years i ll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens there are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it your attitude and hands create the sound in the end a pedal does not make you play better practice does if you are familiar with the ocd or can get one and a b side by side it you ll be amazed cool looking pedal box to boot and nice its like really just wow you know like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it
798	i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig i am a bass player by trade though i dabble with many other instrument as many of us do i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows when the sound system is adequate via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals and then to the mixer i use the at xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables this cable at least in its form sounds just as good as my mogami silver xlr i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic i have several i don t have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables on short i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike this pedal is terrific it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac the name is somewhat misleading although you can certainly eq your sound in that direction the real treat is the huge variety of boost tone and gain you can dial in its mindbending the gain is superb not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer this pedal is an audio swiss army knife i love these patch cables they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it i ve ordered about batches of these guys and i would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex the length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes however there are many cables of much lesser value which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown i bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and i love it i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar i have a vfe alpha dog and an mxr custom badass od before the pedal after the pedal i use an mxr phase and flanger vfe blueprint delay and then a byang triverb when all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when i am not going through a more traditional amp rig buy the pedal it s great works well with every pedal i tried so far can t ask much more than that from it it was the easiest one on my wallet here on amazon go for it if you need one or this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used for direct recording it does if used with an amp maybe but however you use it it is sweet there is no shortage of tubescreamer clones on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues jazz and rock the digitech bad monkey is one such example but the chinese made joyo jf vintage distortion just be the best and it s half the price of a ts about the manufacturer joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor very similar to an mxr in size and switch but cloning the circuitry of well known classic and modern boutique effects pedals some people jump to conclusions about chinese products but don t just take it from me do your homework the response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive and there are great vendors distributors within the u s that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days i m definitely a fan of joyo products as for the vintage distortion itself people have said it s based on either a ts or the more expensive ts frankly while the latter is apparently warmer and less mid range heavy than the former i m not sure there s any significant difference i played this jf side by side with my ts and it s probably one of the more exact clones in the joyo lineup for example the joyo ultimate drive is an excellent higher gain overdrive pedal based on a fulltone ocd but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there some of which are arguably better than the original with the settings matched the jf performed almost exactly like the ts in level gain and tone there probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full which isn t a bad thing it s very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer i ll probably be keeping my tubescreamer if only because it s an iconic pedal that performs well but it s superior in name only if i had to use the joyo vintage overdrive in its place i d be no worse for the wear stars highly recommended good deal
799	i guess i have tried about every type of pick around thick ridged things with thin strumming edges great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side look this is just easy the star hole means i grip it and it doesn t move until i let go never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the pick pen on the counter of the local music store trying to find that feel right yup cause they were three for works as described for the price i have no complaints at all clamps firmly and easily doesn t move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time i know it will live up to the finder name very easy to use very good for a quick tune up might be a little to tight for checking intonation very fast readout and fast on off for a fender licensed product the build seems a bit on the cheap side the plastic is kinda dollar store quality but this tuner tunes very well comparable to more expensive korgs or snarks the screen is bright and while it does not change color the dial is easy to read buy a couple and leave one in your guitar case and another one in your car so you can always tune up for those unexpected performances this tuner has a bright backlight a padded clip it rotates pivots does flats and calibration from hz to hz simple to use runs on one cr pancake battery included what s not to like stars all the way i have others in different cases and one on my work bench they have been very dependable and easy on batteries this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished additional edit this particular unit does not respond a quickly as other identical tuners that i have i is accurate just doesn t respond to the string a fast i still give it stars great mic for the price is it a sm no but sounds pretty damn good it s light don t know if it would handle major abuse but wow for bucks you really can t go wrong plus they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup it also looks pretty damn sharp don t see how they even afford to make these things for this price if you want a really good sm clone i would recommend a behringer xm if you are looking for a back up mic or you are a cheapo this will probably satisfy you i would have knocked off a couple of stars if it was over bucks but for bucks i don t think you are gonna find a better microphone i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones they are great products but i find one thing about them absolutely infuriating the design of the ball joint that connects the tuner to the clip both of my snarks have broken off at this joint i am a home player i do not put the tuners under any type of stress this fender tuner is a great alternative the way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a snark however as others have mentioned this fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a snark so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented however for the home player this tuner will work just fine the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be it is smaller than a snark but not by much the clip works well with a prs headstock which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a strat style headstock the only real negative i see is to change the battery and to put the first battery in requires the use of a very very small phillips head screwdriver i build computers so i had one handy but i would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand i liked this tuner the look the size the ease of use the quality performance until it died i think what happened is i just left it on too long my problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it since it died that first time it doesn t seem to perform the same i also haven t really paid much attention to it since it died because i sent another similar tuner in for replacement and i got an acoustic guitar that has an on board tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitar i wouldn t recommend against this product just remember to hold the power button to turn it off good tuners can tune several different instruments just be careful you have it set to the right instrument when you are tuning or you will go through a lot of strings i have several of these they are a great size and can be left on your instrument if you desire personally i prefer the snark tuner but these are a fairly close second it does the job it s bulky but it works well it comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets or to use the tablet while still in the case great price and quality it is nice to not have to connect two pedals inches away with a cable this clip does the same thing that the hercules guitar stands do lock your guitar in place so you don t have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger the auto close function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe
800	i picked these up on impulse they were on a good sale and i was dissatisfied with my older cheaper set of panasonic over the ears i m glad i did these are excellent headphones and they ve exceeded my expectations on just about every level the sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise they feel extremely sturdy and well made from the cans themselves to the nice thick coiled cord although a removable cord would be a nice bonus finally and this is important they re incredibly comfortable as a video editor i often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time the cans rotate on two axis so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and well padded they grip your head snugly without that horrible vice grip feeling i ve heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under i haven t tried enough pairs to make that judgement but i will say that i highly recommend them it s one of the best purchases i ve made in a long time super low capacitance on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from mogami canare etc the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves super handy elastic cord wrap these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price i used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors but with these i don t see the point the lifetime exchange warranty also makes the diy repair thing kind of pointless too of course amazon s return policy is still days so be aware of that you d need to mail it back to the mfr or take it to another dealer to exchange that is if you ever had to i purchased the dr for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs and it accomplishes that very well the battery life is great the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it and the build quality is pretty solid my only issue is the internal mics while crystal clear in terms of quality can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things in addition they are very susceptible to wind even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air i highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery wow the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry but plug in some real mics and voila the dr becomes something special but i do not always want to carry around so much equpment and was hoping for better internal mics honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing and why is the line out so darn noisy must be defective oh well gonna have to send this back allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams dr dr mk and dr and for myself ended up buying nothing their differences for your ears are dr this is a good quality toy no line in use its own mic you will be ok with this for meetings etc not really that good for music can be done but not as good if you use ext mic u wont be happy either high background hiss noise relative to all dr etc etc only slightly better than all else same dr was much quieter in noise level be it in mic ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around dollars this can be used to semi record music too so testing on their own mics that last one was far far better than the first two for those wantingline in means only that dr however my tests involved checking sound quality of bit more seriouslive recordings took output from our zoom r recorder and output to the dr upon comparing the resulting cds a mstr ed by the zoom r and print to cd vs b recorded dr printed to cd the sound was obviously better with a no need to buy any a d recorder attempt at this price level if one is looking for semi serious master recorder my budget must be tripled at least and then to go out to test some more no cheap way is there for those curious the whole idea has come from wanting to connect units of zoom r not wanting to use computer software taking the outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box and getting them downto channels and finallly to some mastering digital recorder hoping perhaps the tascam ss r or r might do the trick in the tests to come many thanks and may your camels always have two humps k i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall if you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good tight spacing i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn t be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures so i will have to do new pictures but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack decker bdl av all in one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about minutes i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional looking installation as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shape i do not however recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately edit i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in it took about minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line at any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go
801	sturdy stand i like this almost as well as the ernie ball alternative i ve been using for years with shaler strap locks these work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently you may or may not love the details but they work just fine and to me are extremely comfortable i use this cable for small home recording projects i do not take the cable around to gigs or shows as i am pretty sure it wouldn t last longer than a few months of heavy use the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy if your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job this is your product i ve been using ableton for years and it never crashes i connected this interface with live on windows i set my default playback and recording device as line out scarlett i usb and set it as my default device it crashes every time in ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on youtube sometimes i hears pops and clicks after minutes and have to reset the asio all driver which is the same issue with my audio technica at usb mic my computer is an amd system and i have used my at usb on a dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience pros they look very nice they cause much less wear than the nd hand rack screws and washers cons more expensive and i had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship i d purchase these again but i now have but only need at the most once my rack is filled i needed a single button switch for my little mustang i that i practice on i ve never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is it will do the job but it s lightweight and won t sit flat on the floor if the cord isn t laying exactly right i searched a little further and ran across this switch on amazon by scrolling down a bit marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts folks this thing is built like a tank the casing is made of heavy duty i don t know what gauge solid steel there s nothing rinky dink about it i plugged it in to the ftsw jack clicked the button the led lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset again light went out and back to the original it felt solid under my foot and i don t think one can tear the casing up unless they have a or lb sledge hammer i don t know how well the electronics will hold up i just got it today but the switch again feels solid like it s supposed to it cost me with shipping it takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we re use to with amazon but it ships directly from amplifiedparts i believe i m a fender fan but this beats their single switch thanks for reading guys lane h i use this little guy in connection with my daw and digital piano i run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line in ports for recording and i also run vst intruments on my daw that i trigger via usb midi from the piano and use this device for digital audio conversion i listen through sennheser hd headhphones plugged in to this and i also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables i purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface the behringer uf that device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things a volume knob and balanced in outs the volume knob thing i could work around but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops even with a ground lift plug so i needed to go with balanced cables i m glad i did the balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems this was a good purchase however i would say to anyone who doesn t need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the behringer it s a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well further it s class complaint so you don t have to use behringer s drivers it s plug and play i have some good things to say about the focusrite scarlett i all about the hardware and some bad things all about the software i ve tried using the driver version which came with the disk and the udpated which i downloaded from focusrite s website to let you know what i need in an interface balanced stereo in out high quality headphone amp volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line good digital to analog conversion low output latency input latency not important to me i don t use the mic preamps which is one of the big selling points of this device the good this box is simple and well designed it does what you want has very convenient controls and has high build quality i m pleased with the digital to analog conversion it has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp it has switches so each input can be a line in or microphone pre amp it has a switch for zero latency monitoring of whatever is coming in the headphone amp was of particular concern for me i use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem the behringer headphone amp was only ok specifically it has an output impedance of ohms the rule of thumb for good headphone amp matching is that the output impedance should be the impedance of the headphones my hd s have ohms of impedance breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response in my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass most manufacturers don t list their output impedance possibly because they are embarrassed anyway focusrite does which is one reason i trust them a little more the output impedance is less than ohms respectable but not amazing still not as low as i would need in principle but i can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones there s plenty of extra voltage here too so i could drive higher impedance cans if necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced ins and outs work very well the ins accommodates a trs style in and xlr the light around them shows when something s actually coming in and shines red when it s in danger of clipping there s lots of gain available i have them turned all the way down almost the outs are trs style balanced or unbalanced and are located on the back i like the look of the box with a red metal case and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well the usb cable is just a type b port this means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever the behringer for example was hard wired to its cable king of annoying it s bus powered i actually would have been fine with a wall wart but this is even more simple i really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware the bad the driver for this thing is horrible under windows xp i have a clean installation with nothing installed except my daw software acrobat reader and this driver i mean my computer is really stripped down performance using the behringer was good the latency time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers was ms using the behringer which isn t really perceptible unfortunately the focusrite driver though it s technically asio apparently doesn t have anything like an acceptable latency the lowest latency i could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was ms at that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy it s very difficult at least for me to work with a large latency like that i was ready to return this device when i decided as a last ditch effort to install asio all that s sort of an asio driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer s driver perform at a decent level i installed it and it worked the output latency was a tiny ms only of which are actually output latency so this is really impressive i conclude that the hardware is very very good in this machine but the software is horrible unfortunately you can t actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn t recognize the device and it never even turns on it s not class compliant unlike the behringer so now i have two drivers for it installed only one of which i use the bad news is that this configuration is very buggy in general when i just turn the computer on and try and play my vst instrument all i get is crackles and pops until i open the asio configuration panel and increase the buffer the funny thing is that it doesn t matter where the buffer starts out i always have to increase it before i get any good sounds out i can start it out with a huge buffer lots of latency and it will crackle until i open it and increase the buffer yet more i have to do this every time i turn on the computer also sometimes if i leave it on for a while and come back it will be crackly again until i increase it yet another step we are talking about major bugs here i decided to try ditching asio all and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again maybe there was a setting i was missing as i was trying to set the buffer size i heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted when it came back i couldn t get good sounds out even when i turned the buffer way up tried rebooting a few more times still didn t work so i uninstalled and re installed the focusrite software at first it didn t work i had to install asio all as well and now i can sort of get sounds out of it half the time i hope you are getting the idea these drivers are terrible awful a monkey could have written a better driver i would give it star if it wasn t for the fact that the device works very very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play i guess i m willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works i would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical the good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them i m hoping for that they have already revised the driver once which is amazing because even the driver is seriously an abomination just like the closing thoughts unfortunately there really isn t a usb interface that has a good driver the behringer driver always worked but if you moved the interface from one usb port to the other it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver however you didn t have to use the behringer driver and asio all would give you ms and perform without any complications that s about as trouble free as i ve seen in this type of device if you read about the presonus audiobox usb and the m audio fast track pro probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one horrible horrible drivers that never get fixed actually mackie makes a competitor as well the onyx blackjack but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time maybe it s better under mac i don t know interestingly this is really the only usb device in this range that s quite shocking considering how long the usb standard has been around the only real implication of this is that the usb devices like the m audio and presonus can only do two channel audio in or out not both at the same time there s not enough throughput in usb so in light of the competition the focusrite looks kind of ok unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers at least in this range of device think there s no need for good hardware and especially good software at least the hardware in this one is up to spec we can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future bottom line this is a fantastic star device if you can make the software work consistently if you are on a tight budget or don t care about balanced in out i d recommend you go with the behringer uca or ufo they are tons cheaper class complaint and have better drivers if you use a high impedance headphone with it even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one update may a new version of the driver came out since the writing of the above the new driver actually works i have stopped using asio all and i get decent latency once in a while not too often it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer and some percentage of the time when i do that it will reboot my computer if i don t change anything most of the time it works ok i would never use this in a mission critical setting i e gigging or pro work but for my home use it s good enough now if you have issues with the driver definitely update i write and record my own music when i upgraded to a new computer with windows it wouldn t support my m audio fast track pro so i had to upgrade the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great very easy to use just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking good all around mike if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio i recommend this one best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals best mike for the price and purpose what my headline says it does exactly what it s supposed to do removes those annoying popping p s out of your recordings until you can afford a sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than you re going to need this and the price was right too i purchased the dr for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs and it accomplishes that very well the battery life is great the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it and the build quality is pretty solid my only issue is the internal mics while crystal clear in terms of quality can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things in addition they are very susceptible to wind even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air i highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery my only gripe is that once in a while after it s been on for a long time it seems to drop out stop working in windows i ve tinkered with my usb power save settings etc and it still seems to be an issue not that big of a deal as it doesn t do it when actively being used but about once every other day i have to unplug the usb and reconnect it could be my system could be the pre amp otherwise no complaints though be wise and download your drivers from the website not the included software i don t even know what is on the software but i think it s a full version behind what you ll find on the website good sound very very low noise except on high gain when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half expensiveif you re planing to record on computer buy a usb mixer for the same price you ll get a lot of stuff and a mixerworks with ios if you have an external power supply powered hub well built easy setup very quiet using with procaster worked well enough but better with addition of fethead high quality unit updated after owning the i for over a year and encountering many difficulties i am revising my once gleaming review the i is a simple set up pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs connect a mic or apparently a low headroom instrument to it run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand alone program and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug ins section of ableton but i figured it out eventually regardless ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly sometimes the i seems to lock up completely so as no audio is being produced from my monitors i wasn t sure for a very long time if this was user error an ableton problem or the fault of the i and its drivers so after the gazillionth crash i screamed ballsdogit and purchased a license for reaper after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months i began to realize that my monitors no longer lock up but that the drivers for the i are indescribably pathetic i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors now i m in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers garbage focusrite everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug ins and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface i have yet to experience a crash but i also have yet to experience any recording time seriously i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the i and came across a response from david focusrite actually saying that you should not use this setup to record electric guitar and that if you need to record electric guitar you should get something with more headroom like the i that is just unbelievable in my eyes i m sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle besides that i ll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and instrument ins there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology how in the heck does this thing have a nearly star rating the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm i have a bunch of different mics and the i when not crashing or locking up the monitors seems to handle all of them well i constantly check for driver updates and have the latest drivers for the i but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett i is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here
802	great deal on a capo it s about the same quality as one i would buy for x the amount elsewhere it takes a while for the shipping but that s stated in the description i was pleasantly suprised i would recommend this capo a strap is a strap what can you really say about it it was about with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine it s comfortable and fits my bass well i m a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it nice value this is a perfect compliment to my current set up i needed a desktop stand for voice overs when my usual recording set up wouldn t do the trick this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly a great buy as the price was perfect as well this one works it can t make me play any better wish it could but it wont make me play any worse other picks usually let me down when i riff and melt faces playing the blues jazz or gospel etc fender heavies are made to make the notes sound like l they have been hit for real i prefer no cheap imitations only fender heavies that s what i smoke a very decent capo switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly great for someone who plays on alternate tunings or someone who likes shifting scales often i ve probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life and find that planet waves makes a good one at a fair price picks will always be a subjective thing every user has his her own preference so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end these are well made last quite awhile and they don t even look bad try them out you might just like them nice item works well great price no need to own one of the more expensive ones for the job it does i have to type more oops got enough typed it s not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isn t for you if you are looking for a solid easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it won t get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you it works great to hang a standard size guitar on there is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but i am not sure it has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs aren t bumped and hangs straight just touching the wall with the body i recommend it its not a very big capo like it looks in the picture and is sometimes hard to get on sometimes but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done the only problem i have with it is that i get the strings a little bent but that might just be me
803	works as advertised for my purpose it is in front of a computer speaker set with woofer for use on a vizio tv as a sound system works fine i have other behringer gear and it always works nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks these are solid good build quality and really do get the job done well easily adjustable versatile in design and function get em i ordered these tuners for my fender blacktop stratocaster mim i just received these tuning machines today the pegs line up so they drop right in remember the e a d are that tall capstans and the g b e are the shorter capstans it all works out i ve also put springs in the block i like stiff tremelo bridge flush to surface and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional strat knobs had to get cts split shaft k pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots the amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar but back to the tuners they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning much easier and faster to change strings i just ordered another set for my strat h s s great guitar but could certainly use these tuners i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture it is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last everest ez series shoulder rest for violin is very good deal if you are learning to play a violin it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor these have good shielding not like the others very nice cable but the white ends which are nice looking could be a little shorter it works awesomely and it s not a bad price for name brand cables if you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar i m pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years i haven t found a wireless unit that i feel comfortable with on stage yet i was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until i purchased these at first i purchased one just to check them out but after six months i decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these there just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too they last forever definitely worth the money i have an epiphone es and recently put these strings on it oh man do they sound nice it s like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy slinkkkkkkyyyy d d addario strings are not my usual strings i have always used ghs and ernie ball strings to my surprise d addario strings are very nice however after years of ghs and ernie ball strings it s tough for me to make a full time change over to d addario strings these fender q r knobs came in and looked good on my schecter i haven t had any problems with them they installed just fine i did have to put a tooth pick in one of the screw holes to tighten it up does what it s supposed to do very sturdy feeling pretty sure i could strangle a person with it if i had to i m not a dangerous person but you know when people request wagon wheel
804	these are good for the average guitar player who doesn t want to much strain or pain on there fingers not the fullest tone but you wouldn t expect that with extra light strings i play bass with these and they have a unique tone the scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music makes rotosound strings really sound off i have not found that they are so hard on strings that the strings were out from use rather than the picks it does take a bit of use to get good with them but it is worth it for when you need that really growling tone these are a little course for what i wanted brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking they may be giving the strings a little premature wear and the loss of tonality is the problem there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm the picks are good they are a little flimsey but are ok the best thing about them is the look at first i thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous but after actually trying one i love it it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow i can honestly say this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out not to mention that it s hard to strum and sounds awful what these picks are good for is leads rock metal shredding and even country the sound is short with a very high tone pitch switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull one plus is while recording i do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking shredding as i did with a plastic pick i still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound but love these picks when things heat up also i d like to add that even though i can play rock you like a hurricane by the scorpions it never sounds quite right until now using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound also these picks have a no slip grip with the fender facing your fingers there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it s very easy to grip and use it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick i can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am re doing i ve learned the hard way that there are some things you don t skimp on and this is one switchcraft is what we used in the air force years ago and are still some of the best made electronic components out there
805	they work as well as any dunlop pick they don t crack which is a big plus if you use the general fender variety i go a little thicker than i would for regular plastic picks because they get flimsy after a while take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store the compensation built into this saddle makes another hit with graphtech tusq products for me they have done the hard work just needed some personal fine adjustments and good to go good sound quality for not being bone this thing is incredibly cool double the record time of the closest competitor the tc ditto and about twenty bucks cheaper your loop can be as long as minutes with unlimited over dubbing this pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers likely due to pre order obligations and a delayed release it was worth the wait you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music it s a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing operation is simple press once to record press again and it begins playback press a third time to dub on top of your last layer if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub tap twice to stop play of the loop press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing switch is a soft switch so there is no click it is very responsive to pressure there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop nicely done digitech good quality and doesn t cost very much the price is great too glad i bought it folds up well has a black finish on it yep i said it better than a tubescreamer this pedal has a wider gain range far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid s screamer the only thing it seems to lack is the smooth creaminess of an old but i can easily live with that this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat these patch cords work like a champ i use them with my pedal board and haven t any issues with signal quality they give some versatility in their length i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much the colors well ok they re a little odd but for the price i dealt with it i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they don t disappoint they re fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying i put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far no dead cables yet i ve been using them for months or so when i look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables so bright and festive i just feel beautiful all over again alright it was not i already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most sound sculpting investment you could make as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though this is a great stand and highly adjustable can be used seated or standing for a person over feet tall there was a review i read with negative comments about the design claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off nonsense there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock solid because it s lightweight and portable i could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height but this is a great stand
806	podcasting on a bit of a budget setup i wanted good sound quality nice warm tones these mics deliver in a world where i didn t quite have the cash for condensers i wanted i needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word these sound great for under was fantastic i am glad i didn t break budget here i m using these with the behringer fx mixer i am so extremely happy with them we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system it s very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely these are lasers you can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace i haven t tested the sound feature but i ve seen it on videos i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained these little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks i simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead and they produce no audible hum into the circuit they are unbalanced jacks though note the single black band at the end of the plug so if you need balanced jacks for your system those with two black bands make sure you take that into account before ordering by the way i have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording just saying
807	i ordered this capo on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday i had never used a capo of this design so i was a little skiptical but i figured with the price i might as well give it a try this thing works great there is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar the spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board i have only used kyser capos in the past but this one works just as well only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to otherwise you ll get some rattling noise from the strings once you get the hang of placing it where you need it it works very fast when you need to change keys i m not going to recommend this over the capos it s better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made i decided to try this one out but the construction of it makes it feel like it s going to break if i pull it too hard and because of that it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove but once it s on it works i was skeptical because of the price but these work great it is even large enough to use with my string what a great device this is the first quick change capo i ve owned i used to use those old stretchy things since i play at some jams it s important that i can change quickly and accurately move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune the capo looks nice and works without any problem you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff but the build is solid and it looks like it will last for a long time this is a very useful tuner since it s small fast and pretty rugged i ve dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubbery like casing i have an older model that i still use also
808	when i was searching for midi cables for my art x foot controller i came across these hosa ones and they were dollars each as they are now i realize i would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly you must realize that they are only feet as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect strings are half the battle with stringed instruments a bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point these strings make my cheap ukulele sound not so cheap and i imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point i also play guitar and martin is one of my choice brands for strings so i figured they wouldn t let me down when i decided to play the ukulele i was correct when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there even a professional would appreciate this capo i am learning to play the guitar i needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound i debated between this one and the other popular slightly more expensive one i cannot speak to that one s assembly process but i found this one to be reasonably simple i also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raise lower it the same goes for tilting it is a superb stand with ample table space for book ipad capo some picks and if you are creative headphones i love it and i am using it almost every single day very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered as of today this is the one that wins in the height shelf and space categories very versatile tuner it automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away it also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them there are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy duriong my lessons my instructor talked about several models of tuners that a guitarist can get some are old time one still with a kick and the one he recommended was the snark nor the shark and that is what i thought he said when i first heard it there were several kinds of tuners and i was looking for a good quality made of sturdy materials and was in a good price range the snark i chose has been working just great for me great tool i used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys but this trims steel and nylon with ease the quick slack take up winder is nice also but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars this is a great capo clamps well and quickly the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break aluminum not plastic i like it and it was well under the price of others this is a pretty good non expensive capo you can spend more but this does what you need it to do these strings are just okay they last about months and then they start to fray a little bit i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars i m surprised i haven t broken it yet
809	it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand it is very solid and will last a long time a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made i don t think that you would go wrong this obviously is trying to copy the kyser brand capo and it does it pretty well feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise the cardboard insert in the package even has the lifetime guarantee but no info on where to mail it and that s pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect but other than that it s a good cheap capo hi folks ok this thing is cheap that s cool but a cheap item you can t use is money thrown away before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it s too small well i want to clear this up once and for all it is too small specifically it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so depending on your guitar and it doesn t open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret even on a skinny neck this thing really is a puzzler i mean who the hell would make capos this size especially when they could ve made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid however a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele and for way cheap ha ha but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size this is utter garbage cheers
810	you have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal the only think i can think of is moderately high power consumption so i suggest using the power supply rather than batteries it is a joy to play almost any style with these though i prefer jazz blues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortion oh yes the clincher is this only costs a tad over bucks very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range this is thus far a good bargain i have used it to hang a heavy string the arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt no chance of falling there are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal i hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it s really sturdy i can t say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that s the point i ll use a stand if i m going to use a guitar often i had a lb drummer fall into the wall where i had these baby s hung up and not one fell or almost fell nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound no too much heat and easy plug for instant job this is fine for my music room at home where it isn t likely to get bumped too hard i wish the bottom didn t swivel because i don t see a need for it to do that but it keeps my guitar handy and does the job i wanted it to do at a low price i like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out however i wouldn t recommend this for the stage where there are crowded conditions and it is more likely to suffer a heavy bump for that you would want a larger tripod at the bottom to make it less likely to topple i love the freedom the g gives me i m a real klutz with my cords especially on the ml designed guitars so i figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun the sound is a lot more there between this the bill lawrence humbuckers that the sound is unforgiving and those mistakes will come through real clear making you work on your technique and become a better player i took off a star because i don t like the prospect of being a slave to duracell i am hoping that rechargeable batteries will be good enough for my needs and i ll give it stars side note the foot cord they provide was junk for me i suggest ordering some better ones it was my favorite capo someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment had to buy another one
811	the most diverse pedal i own you can play everything from pink floyd to parkway drive with just a few tweaks i own a red blue and now a black one this one is the best yet very easy to read this isn t a terrible tuner and for how cheap it was it wasn t a ripoff however it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim when it does work it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner however almost all of the time it s fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it s the same it also did not come with batteries and replacement ones aren t cheap and are very hard to find i don t think this is a terrible product due to the low price but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously get a real desktop tuner a cheapo one is only bucks more and you can find real full sized affordable batteries for it put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a great tough i could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here i bought this for my takamine egsf sc acoustic electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well i am very happy with the low price i got and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case it has exceeded my expectations i love this little tuner it s better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar and as accurate and easier to use than the one on my vox tonelab st i m planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case use it every time i restring my guitar works really good i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary this is the new and improved snark the display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright i found with other models that the display faded and was not renewed even with a new a battery the only downside to this one is that the bars on the display are so thick that the string has to be more out of tune before it shows up on the screen so the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens however the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws i put these in my ibanez ew acoustic electric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing not to mention they look fantastic they fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a q tip to make sure they seated fully absolutely tickled with the look and performance very highly recommend i bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was easy to use and handy for any string instruments only thing i regret is not getting one sooner as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere i hate buying them because i know they are somewhere in my house but i just can t find them with this i take all my old credit cards student id cards playing cards etc and make my own i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me it rocks pun intended bottom line every guitarist should have one no excuses i have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong i use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric great design i cant see how they could improve this at all i almost always play finger style without a pick but on the occasion i need a pick i like these easier to strum sounds good to me if you re doing a lot of picking out individual strings you ll probably want something thicker but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good plus pick out a few strings here and there i love the snark tuners but don t know that i d call it super tight or faster than the older sn i feel the display is an improvement easy on the eyes hopefully more reliable than sn i ve had pixels dropping out on one sn that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine too soon to tell if the sn will hang in there i don t see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an sg don t know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat response time on the sg is longer than the older sn model but i haven t yet tried to understand what s going on with it have t tried it on bass yet but i know that the sn didn t play well with the e string open no big deal i just tune it at th fret could choose any note since it s chromatic speaking of which playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the snark tune any string to match the song and then tune the other strings with the same displayed error bottom line is that it s a great tuner and it s not likely that i ll get much use out of the old korg tuner that once balanced on my knee this guitar tuner is simply amazing i feel like i should have paid at least bucks for this thing but is practically a freaking steal the display is so nice the quality is amazon and this thing is beyond accurate never using another tuner again in my life snark forever play very mello easy on my fingers too can t come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on my taylor acoustic easy to use and the clip is sturdy a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it this is one great piece of equipment even on an unplugged electric guitar just clamp it on the end of the guitar and it picks up vibration for tuning easily and tunes spot on adding to that is it s convenient small size and being unbelievably cheap price why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job this thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning it has many features i have yet to utilize but good to know they are there if needed i m very satisfied with the performance of the cm with a few tweaking i could emulate the sound i get from my fulltone ocd i d say it s very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the tone control a toggle switch lets you choose between classic modified setting a tweaker s delight the level knob has a lot of juice if you set it at or o clock it s plenty loud enough although you can t use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the gain knob to zero if you have a single coil it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up not so for humbuckers too much gain you can also stack the cm with other pedals i dusted my old boss ds and run it along with the cm and was able to get some good tones the ds usually hurts my ears but with the cm behind it sweet the hardwire cm may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from klon zvex or lovepedal but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost it s well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to there may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good try it you can t go wrong update did a full comparison between the cm fulltone ocd joyo crunch distortion gain joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the cm and ocd rd mix the cm has the most amount of control with separate high low controls followed by the ocd with just a tone control and the joyo crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control since the cm has the widest tone range i can make it behave like a treble booster nuance the ocd cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic the cm is a close second and the joyo crunch being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind i own at least of these i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too i have reviewed this before i like it works really well i have a lever harp with strings so i really needed something that would help me keep it well tuned one hint from our son who also has one be careful when you twist the head he broke the first one and had to buy another one i am very careful how i adjust and have had no problems i have used d addario for a number of years i m not hot about their acoustic but electric they re a whole new world i like these nickel on my tele they give them that extra twang there is a lot to think about with a strap lock is it sturdy reliable does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar can it fit in a case or does it make you take the strap off every time you put your guitar away the fender schaller design covers all of these bases well i believe it is sturdy and reliable unlike it s dunlop competition the stress on the guitar is roughly equivalent to plain strap buttons it will not fit in all cases but will fit in many i ve switched over to this design and couldn t be happier with it note i advise using a crescent wrench and a socket to tighten the nut one always wants to avoid over tightening but the risk of under tightening is high without proper leverage if you don t really tighten the nut down you are likely to have things fall apart while playing some day i love this thing it quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument i own electric acoustic guitars electric acoustic bass guitars it clips on securely is easy to see stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on off from the front you can barely notice it at all i just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed when i switch to another instrument i un clip it and take it with me to what ever i want to play next i love this thing love it love it love it anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that i am not fond of the snark displays i prefer the needle type because it s symmetric above and below center while the snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp however that s me and ymmv as they say on the internet don t ask then why i got a sn i don t smoke drink or womanize the unit is cheap the money s got to go somewhere and i like to play with accessories i am fond of saying that it doesn t matter which type of tuner you use because they ve pretty much become a commodity they all tune well with the same accuracy so it comes down to looks and price well that s not quite true some models suffer fits in certain situations the rapid fall of the old intellitouch was in my mind not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low e string on a martin dreadnought a web search will reveal countless workarounds i and the rest of the world apparently buy a tuner to tune not work around lately i ve become enamored of thekala ka ubassfs solid mahogany u bass fretted if you want a tuning challenge the low bass e string is it the sn hardly hiccups other tuners seem to do okay but require a little coaxing not the sn that s stars in my book this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole it would not work for an f hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides the dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly don t push it all the way in after moistening and you won t have a problem i drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the d and g strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole they can t be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings i ve never had one of these move from where i left it if the sponge isn t dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case when the humidity is very low or less the sponge dries out in to days even if the case isn t opened as with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days if you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar or don t want to see one use a guitar humidifier especially during the winter heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels between and is ideal for most guitars air conditioning can do the same for especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar s is okay for many reasons it s always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use a humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons this worked well for that tried this and was not happy seemed to want to be off too much got the fender ft instead this one does have a great view on the led but if it doesn t tune right what s the point i would try the fender just a note if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing just a thought this is my third snark tuner i keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear i use it on all my stringed instruments haven t tried it on a base this tuner is easy to attach and read and the price is great i have spent bucks on tuners that do not function as well i have had of these tuners you d think i d learn after one they calibrate okay it s just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device both of mine broke this way to me for the price it s made cheaply try d addario instead love their tuners theres a reason why so many uke manufacturers supply these strings as standard on their best ukes they are simply the best there is for a fair price the sound brightens up and amplifies even the most dull sounding uke and allows for a smooth experience once stretched properly not much more can be said about these awesome strings stop reading this and order them excellent steel guitar strings each string has a color coded end each string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where purchased a set box and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness i went with the mediums try the light if you are a beginner i have four snarks and one other brand the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display tuning is quick and simple plain leather looks good and has the fender logo prominent no padding which may be a bit of a problem if you are playing long hours i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it i am impressed how well this works i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs this has solved it it s important to you to know the diameter of your guitar s soundhole i ve tried this with different acoustic electric guitars fender cd and fender kingman both of them with cm in diameter and fits perfectly i had read all reviews before deciding purchase and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering i should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound unplugged i would not consider this as a solution for it if you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar without hesitation this one is for you i bought this just to see if i might enjoy learning or if my shoulders i m gettin old lol would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice i wouldn t say it s agreat instrument but way more than i expected for after i changed the strings i used the extra set that came with it it actually produced decent sound i bought anew bow for so and found i like the one that came with it at least as much the case is excellent i ll prob use it with my upgrade so for the price you really get far more than you pay for p s the shoulder rest is kinda useless though my favorite string from back in the s when i had my own guitar shop great strings and the best packaging the snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat great tuner i got about three of them this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to i like the size smaller than your regular picks and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar i originally was planning on purchasing packs of xm s but after hearing the difference between the xm and the xm it was a no brainer i was looking to get vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song i really wanted sure sm s but the budget did not allow it i normally stay away from behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc but these microphones were a game changer for me they have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives also an excellent output level to the mixer i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges i was told by all singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end i do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now this is not my only capo but it s my cheapest it works as well as other more expensive ones this one was a good deal through amazon com i m a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play i however am having a ball playing as loud as i want with as much or as little gain as i feel like at the moment with my classic rock guitar headphone amp my rickenbacker sounds just the way i want with as much clarity or with all the smoke as i feel like dialing in for now it is so nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in put in my ear buds and practice for a while anywhere i want anytime i want downside i wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size vox amp and the controls are small hard to read but easy to learn you do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time solution hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive i plan to pick up other versions of the amplug from vox to extend my fun this was a good choice buy one i personally use this in conjunction with my tu on the ground but honestly it just gets a read faster than the tu sometimes and it s a fraction of the cost really efficient way to go in my opinion i am a pit orchestra musician and i ve lent it to people who play lots of different instruments and it really tends to work well with all of them good spring action made pretty solid no buzzing on the strings when i put it on the lifetime warranty is what i am stoked about i will probably buy two more for my other guitars highly recommend it this tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly and i ve enjoyed using it it does its job and it s well worth the money i ve been using a standard size pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit i use it to keep pedals in place a line m a seymour duncan twin tube classic and a live wire a b switch the first two are pretty heavy and bulky i needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case being carried vertically with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of them i decided to try out the power grip and have been extremely impressed first i stripped the old velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly it all came off pretty easily i then applied one strip of power grip to each of the bottom panels on the pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals i then let everything sit for hours as recommended after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured the pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metal on metal abrasion however you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhere i also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around with some effort and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bit the grip also bonds to itself unlike velcro where you re keeping track of male and female tape when replacing it i would recommend following the manufacturer s instructions and applying this stuff to clean hard non porous surfaces i ve heard that the adhesive doesn t work on rubber wood etc many pedals have rubber padding feet on the bottom but i ve had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape on you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides get a few rolls as a meter doesn t go as far as you d think i really did not expect much from this rag i just wanted a good quality lint free scratch free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use i was totally surprised that it actually works this good removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too you may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag this thing rocks it picks up every smudge smear print and leaves nothing behind it s an amazing little cleaning tool and i will replace it if when it ever wears out if you are like me and you want your instruments to look clean grunge free onstage you should check out this little wonder you can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want doesn t get any easier great product a note about the mixed reviews i really wish amazon would separate the different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page it really isn t fair to the actual good product to have it s rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a completely different item it also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want when i go to the product page for the amazingly good micro fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint it makes me sad i have had both of the other items and this micro fiber cloth is nothing like the other this item has sewn seamed edges that will not fray it never leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there my guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth and i use the thing almost every day i got on this rant bc i came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it i told him i would just get another then i came here and couldn t remember which version i bought and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item leaves behind lint what the crap are they talking about turns out they are talking about a completely different item i looked up my purchase history and found i had bought the micro fiber then i placed an order for more for me to give away again putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course putting an apple and a lemon on the same page literally and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed at least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones you know what version to buy and which to avoid anyway end rant this is an excellent product i ve used one of these before and don t remember it having lock washers this does when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened for you cannot go wrong with this bear in mind that it s for a standard hole diatonic harmonica not the hole chromatic style i think this patch looks cool on the bass i don t really hear any difference in sound but does give your drum head a better life span not a lot of moving parts on this piece lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body i ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use very secure the best i ve used so far
812	i ve tried so many other strings over the years just to see if i was missing something i wasn t there s something about the feel and tone of ernie ball regular slinkys that i absolutely love my local music store has for the price of deal on strings which is a nice deal however this deal is a little sweeter if you can wait for the delivery it s a no brainer easy to adjust and holds the ipad secure i actually have ipads on one mic stand one shows charts while the other plays backing tracks no issues at all and would order again ernie balls strings at a great price nothing more to say this is not my only capo but it s my cheapest it works as well as other more expensive ones this one was a good deal through amazon com
813	i got this for our church i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall they where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly ernie ball super slinky electric strings set is very good opportunity to replace the original strings on your new guitar recommend it it s a pretty cool little gizmo the clip on feature is really helpful too makes me wonder what i did before i had one wonderful price and great product buy it love mine and have recommended to every musician i know works great and love the colorful display these are solid stands for holding your guitars i use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great they are an excellent value the reason they are so important to have is that by having your guitars out and available to play you will get more practice they help me pick up my guitars much more often instead of dragging out the case and getting a single minute session i might get or minute sessions a night more on the weekends stands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store i highly recommend these for around the house use very cheap and great for price but recording with this isn t the best idea good for live performance on a budget i bought a couple of these two years ago they are a sturdy but lightweight stand the small footprint is nice for those with limited space i use for both electric and acoustic guitars i will say that the two i recently purchased are not the same as the ones purchased in the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not the newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support the body support now inserts through the base tube the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece the rubber feet are also smaller these changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable however i believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars i didn t notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported there may be a concern about damage to certain finish i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material very good strings
814	i ll echo what others have said this is a superbly built instrument for the price and i don t know how epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively it looks feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much a few notes what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the vintage model is actually a super rich deep deep mahogany maroon color and it s unbelievably beautiful as others have said the factory supplied strings are crap if you judge the instrument by them you ll be disappointed include a set of aqila nylgut strings when you order this ukulele and restring it as soon as you get it i was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my kala soprano uke normally one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder fuller sound but the les paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all acoustic ukulele and that probably accounts for the quieter tone i think it s a better tone and i m more interested in delicacy than in loudness so i m happy with it if i wanted stadium filling volume i could always plug this into a stack of marshall amps oh i almost forgot one important note to all owners it is possible to remove the stupid ugly pick guard since ukulele players rarely use picks and when we do we use soft rubber or felt ones there s no need to protect the finish from scratching and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument s looks i applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails no sharp tools it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue i was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton without any damage to the luscious ultra glossy lacquer finish and the ukulele looks so much better now if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise just remember the key words slow and gentle don t force anything and you should be fine i love these picks i bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy it is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely this is a great little ukulele to have around the house i originally ordered a different one and got this one in error but musician s friend showed exceptional customer service and refunded me the entire amount of my purchase which included a change out set of strings and told me to keep it all too i was floored back to the ukulele at first i thought this was cheap enough to knock around and abuse but i found myself actually liking this one the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too i used the d addario j black nylon strings the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated it s a fun strum and well worth the the action was a little high for my taste the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible why do they sell an instrument with crap strings that is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument otherwise it s well built and works really it s a three and a half star imo it s not as nice sounding or as playable as my mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings very nice guitar strap i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles good value great seller and fast delivery thanks amazon for a great product i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects i was really surprised to see how well they sounded i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route if you just want to play around a little this uke will do i ve tried several portable amps for the price the honeytone can t be beat it has volume tone and overdrive knobs the overdrive can go way too over so easy on that one comes with a battery but can be connected to a v adapter important note reverse polarity negative central interestingly i have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic electrics or piezo based pickups better than magnetic pickups but for a small portable light weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone they don t come much better it has a belt clip on the back but you ll have to supply your own earphones and v adapter if you want them battery is included of course a guitar cable is a required extra well worth the money
815	this audio adapter works perfectly why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio i m able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception excellent sound quality premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station you can t go wrong with these we re ordering more pairs this does exactly what a music stand is supposed to do this thing is awesome i love it thanks forsuch a great affordable product this microphone stand it a fairly good buy because it is a light and portable stand it is not built to be fully extended with microphones such as the behringer xm s adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone i found that i needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal i like many things about this tuner the fact that it turns off quicker than most and you only have to press the button to turn it off unlike the fender which you have to press and hold may not sound like a big deal but if you need to change tune in the middle of a show this one s faster the fender tuner in my opinion and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up but this one s cheaper ahh decisions decisions still you can t go wrong either way some of the stands i have purchased are hollow some are solid at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue i wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m mic or similar i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot but i opened one tried to use it and can t it was a total waste of money but doesn t pay to return it i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it it might serve your purpose again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting good enuf okay i guess but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk i have this hooked up to pedals so far and it s awesome real cost saver on batteries you really cant go wrong for the price i didn t know when i ordered these mic stands that they were on stage stands they are fully adjustable great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics excellent quality i m very happy with this set
816	clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar pluck a string and it will indicate what it is turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done takes minutes to tune the guitar mine is electric works plugged in or unplugged this is my first guitar stand and i have to say i am pretty happy with it it s made of good quality metal and you can tell it s much higher quality than the price tells it to be the neck strap and the base are excellent made of great padding to pad the bottom and can put any guitar base on there look at the other reviews and you won t be disappointed it didn t smell like the other reviews said either big disappointment i ve been so impressed by epiphone s but this one didn t do it quality of manufacture and assembly great pickups far less than inspiring yes it s a great platform but was so expecting those p sound i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it just didn t have the tone and bite i was expecting i could certainly invest in some pup s but i have too many great p guitars to bother roll of the dice i guess
817	these were just what i needed over the years some of the bridge pins on my sttring acoustic guitar have broken and had to be replaced some of them had the white dot some didn t therefore they didn t look uniform with these pins the guitar now looks like it did when i bought it thank you james edward bat owens i use this adapter on the interface mix board end of channel of my xlr cable snake to change channel into my monitor return i plug an xlr to female stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup now i can record with channels and monitor with it s an channel xlr snake why do i go through all that you ask because i have an channel xlr snake and instead of buying another snake why not adapt the snake i have hence the word adapter p i love it it s a great tool to add versatility to your setup no matter what you re doing definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an xlr to balanced stereo it s high quality and very solid i definately expect this to last me a long time good for the price but if you can spend a few dollars more i would recommend the graph tech ones made of durable nylon with pick pocket given stars shipped on time and at good price i recommend this item it sounds great nice and warm and lush one of the better trems i ve had the pleasure to use however i hate the plastic housing and how the input output jacks are located i don t have heavy feet so it will probably last a good long while on my board but i really wouldn t want to put too much weight on it
818	awesome quality strings love em just re strung my string it was a hassle but i got it done nicely this is exactly what i was hoping for the string cutter works better than expected it s nice not having to go hunt down diagonal pliers when it s string changing time the only little issue is that it s a little tougher to spin really fast than the little string winders because of the grip no biggie though small size easy to transport and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy but improving guitar playing p fast delivery and exactly as advertised put it to work making music within minutes the steel gives a clearer sound than the glass bottle slides but you need both good product
819	a great little amplifier good quality good built in effects and is still easy to carry around i replaced the stock speaker with an eminence rajun cajun which has improved the tone and provided increased volume the amp is now capable of being used at small gigs i would highly recommend what can i say that you haven t already read about this amazing pedal if you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal if your looking to play out with it know that it s cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds have a backup take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal that alone can cause problems as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal it has out muscled my other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard i use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and i never turn it off once we start playing i leave it plugged in on the board all the time i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off i carry a backup pedal i love this pedal just don t ever drop it this is the greatest practice amp ever and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band first it s all tube so it sounds really good it s gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast second it s watts and is pretty darn loud i ve used it for band practice and it s definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer at a bar you ll probably need to mic it or use the included line out third if the speaker isn t loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the x and x cabs i have that ll make it loud enough for most bars fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything you ll need most small tube amps don t have built in effects so if you re trying to practice down in the living room you re forced to drag your effects with you that s annoying with this amp everything is built in fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet you can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone else sixth the price is amazing all tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow fender is basically giving these things away i love this amp so much i want to buy one for every guitarist i know the only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch but considering the price that s understandable there s no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them you ll only want the cover and footswitch if you re playing in a band the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out what makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to pedals it comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip one of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don t stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks takes up less room on your pedal board also the plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss it can put out up to ma which is how it can run up to pedals a great item at a great price no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised the sound is very authentic as i have a s tube champ in excellent working order for reference as well as a deville this little amp has the classic fender tube sound with a broad punchy tone and the right amount of compression the included digital effects vibraphone delay reverb chorus and tremolo are all convincing and well executed the modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ tweed deluxe clean dirty baseman princeton clean dirty deluxe clean dirty twin and an array of british and metal amps all and all a super practice amp or mic able performance amp great job fender ps i don t review products that don t stand out as excellent
820	i have owned this product for a while now it has some awesome features this little recorder is absolutely amazing for it s size takes some practice to appreciate all the features i recommended this recorder to a fellow musician friend he bought one also from amazon he loves it records all his gigs with it now instead of the old huge unit he was using told me it does a much better job than his old unit he even used his on a tripod to record a gravesite funeral service that his family can keep for memories of a loved one lightweight small simple to use and it s easy to read in broad daylight can t ask for much more in a tuner great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars soft touch easy care can t beat it one thing tho when your guitar isn t in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere i am going to be finding picks in my files for years put it up on the table when your picks are not in it will work on any instrument you don t need the expensive ones this works just fine just wish the batteries lasted longer first off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to it holds your guitar one thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus i use it for my mitchell acoustic and it holds it perfectly about the effects on finish after googling it calling where i purchased my guitar and reading the little tag on the stand the foam on this and many other stands may affect nitro cellulous laquer finishes how do you know if you have this finish basically the value of your guitar and or the age this finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions it is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars it is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at gc told me good basic strap it s not fancy but it doesn t need to be by being just plain black it tends not to detract from the good looks of the five string bass it s used on a year ago i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r wave mp recorder blackand thezoom h handy recorder gb accessory kit pre accessory kit i wanted a high quality easy to use recorder so even though the h had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use zoom has responded with the h a scaled down version of the h with all of the features of the r and all of the controls right where you need them the h even has additional features over the r but they don t get in the way for example there s a choice of a degree recording pattern a degree recording pattern and even a surround sound option samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website one big complaint i ve had with the edirol is the cost of its add on stand unlike the edirol the h comes with a simple stand in addition the h has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod on a separate note it s much easier to replace batteries with the h than the edirol recently i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r and the zoom h i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness the first time we played them back i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units the second time we played them back my preference was for the h with overall opinion continuing to be split we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all i do prefer the edirol s control buttons to the h s membrane and i m not about to sell the edirol perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and don t want to give it up just yet also the edirol r is the darling of the moment however if i owned neither i couldn t justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h and would opt for the h when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i d need only one recorder i grabbed the h bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor these have good shielding not like the others gives a nice little boost on my blues jr however this is not a replacement for an overdrive pedal in my opinion just more of a boost wish it had a grippy bottom made from rubber vs a smooth bottom made from plastic daddario s are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics they sustain well great tone tune well and last for a good while between changes when the unit first arrived i was concerned because the box had been damaged it shipped in an envelop however once i opened it i discovered an undamaged snark tuner inside in an odd way this reassured me further as it obviously took a beating and remained undamaged when i put in the battery and turned it on it functioned properly it clips to my guitar strong and stays put it s easy to read even when i m on stage and the lighting is less than appropriate for reading a display this size from arm s length i m very pleased with the unit just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes it was worth giving this box a try as someone else previously mentioned set in a tube breakup setting this device still is a little fuzzy the tone none the less is very usable and sounds great i m a happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well thanks for reading this the dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition and looking great it also had two soft cloths that are needed for application removing excess and polishing i couldn t be happier i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner these are the best tuners for the money the display is very stable and it s simply fun and easy to use joyo makes great quality products cheap i love this product it works great all my pedals hove there own power supply works great just clip it on and jam out forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one you ll be happier trust me it does a fair job but i have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes i actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate
821	this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound i m looking for i used to buy all shure products i m switching to gls they are just great and that s all i ve got to say about it it hasn t stuck broken or slipped in any of the string changes i ve used it for costs a little extra but well worth that price you ll need a new one about every ten years or so i still love these things i remember spending over for a guitar tuner in the s and having to unplug from the amp to plug into the tuner to tune and then back to the amp with my guitar hanging round my neck now i just clip it and forget it till i need it and push it s little button if i forget to turn it off it has an auto off feature if it detects no vibration for a while a new batterry lasted me almost two years my first tuner s battery it came with lasted over a year expect to pay to for a replacement battery my more recent snarks are still running on original batteries i ve bought of these over the past couple of years i wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that i could use one handed it gives me piece of mind that somone won t just brush up against a guitar and damage it i ve noticed that it has been backordered on several sites so i expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too this is my second and i love them so much they work flawlessley and tune is amazing get one and dont hesitate
822	nothing special here if you don t like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you don t want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise there are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you don t want the logo on the front of the guitar neck headstock you could even flip it inside out and have the soft leather side exposed i subtracted a star because i think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic i ordered both this one and the lee oskar i couldn t find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the hohner had raised ends i reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok the quality appears good the springs that hold the harp in are strong but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands i can change harps without removing the rack this was my first shoulder rack and i didn t know what to expect i have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and it s challenging but i can get it done this is actually quite good no problems after seasons of work and the neutrik knock off connectors plug into devices well the funny thing is they don t connect that easily to each other like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run but a little finagling will get them to mate i m not one to cheap out on a lot of things but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays i m not saying there isn t a place for high quality cables but if you have jobs were you don t need cables made of pure spun angel s pubic hair these will get the job done when you need an audio insert cable you need an audio insert cable we custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound reinforcement fixed installations for mobile rigs such as mixer cases with processing gear it s simply not cost effective and hosa is our go to brand for reliability and durability there are other brands but our reputation is at stake hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation while lowering our labor costs thanks for such a dependable product hosa thanks for such a great price amazon not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument i bought a few for different basses and guitars but the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag no problem with hard cases leaving the battery dead when i took the instrument out of the case the switch should be on the side of the unit fwiw i like my snarks better faster and more stable tuning a near miss with the ns it is not a replacement for a ts or but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough
823	i ll keep it short i owned a boss eq pedal in the past and didn t have much luck with it i tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound i was looking for but the boss just wouldn t do it for me fast forward a few years and i purchase this little baby on a whim man am i glad i did the sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone i was looking for a small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom end than it could ever manage on its own and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced well rounded sound love it and wouldn t wanna part with it the pedal itself is built like a rock i imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing the individual sliders although not quite as ford tough as the rest of the pedal haha feel nice and slide easy each slider lights up red when engaged which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stage if you re on the fence about an eq or which eq brand to buy i recommend you give this little monster a stomp does not work for all guitars one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling maybe it s just me but that s how they come across i noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel but don t lose that new sound new as fast i didn t have near as much string stretch with these either i ll keep using them just maybe in a different gauge not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no name japanese knock off i play mostly hard rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech metal and prog rock for solo projects where i m playing pretty fast and sometimes hard they also handle de tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like dadaad they are clear with good sustain it is not a replacement for a ts or but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough
824	excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise does not have an on off switch which is a bit disappointing the first rule of microphones is that no one microphone is perfect for every purpose rule two is experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound i ve used shure sm s along with their ancestors and relatives back to i primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but i have used and still do use them for singing some back up vocals the sm does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use some people me included actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic the shure sm the sm is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice for example anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the sm people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm the sm is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect which means the bass increases the closer you get this mic does not pick up well from much over inches away the reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don t sound right on the other hand the sm sounds best several inches away from the user s mouth and works fine up to inches away while the sm is certainly the number one professional pa vocal mic there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly it works ok for conga drums and the like but the sm is about the last thing you d want to use to mic a sax or guitar personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice but for some people they sound great the live vocal mic that works best for me is the shure sm with a windscreen however for other people the sm works better it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do if you have a very deep voice the sm might be the second best choice after the sm which has a better low frequency response one certain advantage of the sm is the excellent gain before feedback capability this mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying pa squeal another advantage of the sm is that it is still available at a slight extra cost with a built in on off switch the sm s ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars i ve seen sm s dented rusty dusty smoked up spit into with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet i ve never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on off switch that got dirt in it all the pro line shure mics are top quality the pro line shures also hold their value well if you buy one and decide you don t like it you can get about what you paid for it on ebay i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one senneheiser s evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look the sm will be the number one on stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice these things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they d still be around for another years at least i bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano ukulele i found i like the snark better for the dollar more in cost the other has multi use bass chord ukulele and seemed cheap i liked the snark so much i bought this one for my concert ukulele you might ask huh why one for each ukulele if you play then the answer is simple for bucks i do not have to hassle swapping tuners out and can just grab my ukulele and go very nice classical guitar strap i have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons don t expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar this is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it this is the way this type of strap is made to work and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested holds my cordoba in position perfectly i wan t sure i would like this thing when i ordered it but it was cheap enough to try i don t like using it as much as i thought i would but that s just me the device works as advertised over a long period of use i think it might leave a mark on the sound hole even though the hook is padded
825	this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable tried these on les paul style with jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about different pedals metal overdrive echo reverb fuzz etc so keep in mind that they haven t broken in yet as i do this review but i do feel confident in what i report here they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels on the high gain metal muff fullbore guytone metal monster swollen pickle and big muff they sound really nice a lot of harmonics and output captured for that stars easy i don t think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold other s may feel differently i am sure then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output so you are getting what they say however for a warm bluesy tone i couldn t get anywhere close to my sound like i can with the pure nickels for that star average to i guess forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment for shredding go cobalt for warm woman tone go pure nickels that s pure folks i also really like the d addario pures also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel hope this helps works great with or without polish it is a good size and the ziplock bag it comes in keeps the polish i use from drying out i ve used dunlop jazz iii s for years but always had a problem when it came to a song that required a lot of strumming the dava changes that for me not only does it allow for accurate picking but it also allows you to strum when needed just roll your thumb back a little works great i ve been using this pick for about months now and have not gone back to any of my other picks a definite star for being my favorite new pick you won t be dissapointed my new electric guitar isn t particularly comfortable to play while sitting so i needed a strap i ve played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable so i hoped to find a padded strap that didn t break the bank this strap fits the bill just fine depending on the angle that your pegs are set however you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling if your pegs are set at an angle like on a strat this strap will last forever if you re on a guitar with a horizontal peg like a lp you ll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well this will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security the padding is ok but not great however it s certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus not great but not bad as well the base strings feel really strange when sliding the th string and the st string were cut while i was playing so i had to change them the second day i installed them bending feels easy all that needs to be said is that it s a peterson just the best tuner s ever i also use one on my pedal board wouldn t use anything else these lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them my other review was for the heavier gauge cobalts but these sound just as good regardless of p strat single coil or humbucker great tone sustain and flexibility i am sold on any cobalt gauge head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and i have tried them all does what it says i have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them much cheaper then buying loads of v batteries
826	bought this distortion pedal for our son who plays his electric guitar daily he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use it also produces a nice distorted sound quality and tone i don t know if i would agree as my generation hails from a different genre of music but he loves it and i guess that s all that matters i bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well use them all the time has velcro too goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface good quality kripes man the one time i go and actually buy a honer and its a bummer this thing has keys off tune i can buy stuff times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk maybe it s a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i m really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b all i can say is buy merana s for tryin out buy suzuki or swan from ebay overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you ll be better off oh btw hot tip for poor guys again you can get a mississipi river harp for only oo if you have a burke s outlet near you they re up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho the doctah has spoken great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f perfectly solid and steardy case that will last a very long time i suppose it does what it is suppose to do it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if i want to spend more bucks for a better one these guitar picks are just the best simply put they are easy to grip onto even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day highly recommended i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex i use the green mm picks and also the orange mm ones i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks great for beginners or the pros excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well
827	seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website but there is no dealer anywhere near me so i bought one sight unseen from amazon based on the good reviews i m glad to say i can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design a traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction the narrow reverse taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom heavy look when viewed vertically back and sides are cherry with only a light stain and the binding is dark the top is natural cedar as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down it appears to be based on the martin outline but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout weight is pleasantly light and the semi gloss finish is comfortable to the touch players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard but those with small hands should consider the slim version with a neck narrower at the nut sound is what really counts however and this canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there the maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high quality fresh strings allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering and the truss rod required adjustment a long reach hex wrench is included if you are not experienced in these tasks a local luthier should do it for no more than or so based on sound playability once adjusted and construction quality this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range it is a real standout in value update dec the more i play this guitar the more i love it it delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought snap and once the action was dialed in the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding i didn t fully realize hindered my playing i am considerng replacing my takamine mini jumbo with a seagull equivalent the apogee jam works great and it sounds great the operation is very simple you plug in your guitar and plug in to your mac or ios device i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band if there is any latency i can t hear it it works beautifully apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception i was able to plug in a microphone line level into this as well and record my vocals likewise it worked well with my string bass as well i was able to record a whole song in no time for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable not really bright enough both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same i would look for something else if i didn t already have this ok for reading a small book in bed but doesn t cover the sheet music brightly enough this little dude does a great job the clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries i highly recommend i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine this mic stand is solid and a good value but it s a one trick pony the picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect the stand comes with threads and does not come with an adapter not a huge deal if you re using a standard mic clip the height is about inches total and i m using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port if you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop i d highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from on stage i have one of those too but it was too tall even at it s shortest setting to mic my drum port but the adjustable height is very handy
828	if you ve read my review of the much cheaper hohner old standby harmonica key of c you know that i love the special it s great for beginners or experts alike sounds great right out of the box and plays well i was able to bend notes right away with this one while other cheaper harps take a long time or never to break in properly all the notes reeds sounded good if you re serious about playing you will be very happy to have this harmonica around i ve had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite my first uke so i cannot compare but it sounds great i don t know what stock strings it came loaded with but they sounded just fine easy to play decent quality not expensive easy to bend plastic comb with no recess this is the lowest level you d want to really play the harmonica and it won t break the bank works amazingly so far i am definitely proud of this product will be buying more in the future great buy i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe well worth the bucks i paid analog with true bypass easy to use with one knob and has nice high quality chorus effect mxr built like a tank works with my boss ds ac adapter too this little guitarlele is great i have tuned to the standard e tuning of a guitar and it manages very well it gives a gently subdued tone that is perfect for playing any time even accompanying music on the tv whilst the family are watching i have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than i had with my twelve string in the last six months added info now that the tuning has settled down it is keeping tune very well with no need to retune during playing the strings it came with are not the best though they are wearing through all ready
829	this is one of those products which is easier to find and purchase online than trying to shop its performance is min max the same i ve used three with no trouble you can get excellent instructions and tips on youtube great little tuner very accurate and portable nice bright screen perfect and the price is right its nice it has a chromatic tuner on it too as wellas guitar and bass too very handy i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners they all work fine for me however the snark sn just has the edge it s performance look and feel are great the added features are also a plus i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar it s my go to for chromatic tuner highly recommend this this stand is small compact and sturdy it holds my tenor uke just fine and when folded fits into the pocket of my uke case it s perfect to take along to a gig or practice and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down
830	holy guacamole you guys this amp i was terrified at first because i plugged in and turned on and had no sound took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase then decided to try once more fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off so rocking i actually got this for my acoustic electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it i keep the volume low and the door open about to get a clean ish tone haven t cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but i m sure it ll sound awesome too it says for a banjo or a mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box it is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on off is really easy i love the hola small instrument stand it is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when i go to the ukulele club it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand it is very lightweight which is also a plus i use the stand at home too i stand my ukulele on it because sometimes i play and then i want to go to youtube to listen to a particular song it is very convenient i have recommended this stand to others also features i like lightweight sturdy and folds up easily if you buy a ukulele and it does not have these strings you should replace them with these strings strings make a big difference in any ukulele however i have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching usually i do my bad these strings are the best haven t found any others that sound and feel so good they lasted years and i play nearly every day for hours go figure i actually thought i didn t need to change strings still don t know for sure because they still sounded so good and show no wear anyway i decided to change the strings because it s been so long happy that i did however if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you i was hesitant at first but this did the job
831	i had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that i almost sent it back but with a little trial and error i figured it out that said this thing is rock solid i was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a ipad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip these are great strings i thought the bullet end was bs hype but i really think it makes the string stronger and the sound clearer and even if that is my rusty ears lying to me i can say with conviction that they definitely fit better with my g l legacy guitars regular strings had the little extra wind from the ball end coming right up to the saddle in some cases these solve that problem i ve owned the same one for years and it s still going strong after many gigs the spring tension is just right i use this clamped to a table and it s a superb product i have a tablet and a touchpad and they both work very well in it nice mount great value buy it this pedal work although i find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup my issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough the m does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal even running the delay on the output side of the m the noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup i run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig when using fuzz and distortion i love this tape for multiple reasons one because when it s on it s on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around you can take it off it won t be easy but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off i was able to get everything off my older board and it came off so clean i was actually able to sell it so this is some good stuff be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals as it hooks to itself so you ll go through it pretty quickly these microphones were made for the studio i used it for live performance you better have a good pa system to enjoy the sound there everything that the video showed it s a great microphone period top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon i bought this brand because i have one of their mic stand mounts for iphone which i like a lot pros the clips did a good job holding my ipad mini without having to remove the folio type cover marware axis quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well cons it s too heavy for my mic stands i tried it on the boom arm and it made it top heavy and unstable if the boom is positioned in a very upright position it s ok but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome i had high hopes for this one but it s not going to work for me i have returned it and ordered a different chargercity model the one with the lever type mount we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system it s very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers this is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as i do i ve tried other types including those that i made myself but i much prefer this one i find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars from fender takamine ovations etc for the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling highly recommended for a cheap tuner this one is pretty good it s about as accurate as the snark and not as delicate the ball joint on the snark makes it prone to breakage if you re not careful packing it in a case or gigbag the display is large and bright i wouldn t use it to intonate an instrument but for quick knockaround tuning it s fine if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static non oscillating chorus like effect it s fine for that as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful all the pitch shift settings sound like they re cents sharp this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it it s hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is i ve read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i m also tempted to get their green mile pedal if you re not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i ve tried to use first time using item and it broke the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke i was really excited to have this and us it now that i transferred all my music sheet to my ipad as soon as i took it off the mic stand the round piece came off would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review but it only kept referring to delivery i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on sad i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music all of my tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet it would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand this tablet mount allows me to use my large toshiba thrive in live performance situations now it makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand i never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use
832	this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedallike many other reviewers my gripe with the new pedals is the switch may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation this pedal lives up to the hype distortion wise it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type od and a full on distortion like a crunchbox or rat i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one i think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos more transparent and organic sounding i have owned the fulltone ocd in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly i also own a v dano cool cat od which is an excellent ocd ish pedal but this one is getting more action these days i am running this into the front of either a palomino v or a jet city watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup the pedal also plays well with others i am getting nice lead tones by running a ts type of od into the front of this one the jf is a really nice dirtbox and not just for the price the fact that you can own it for clams or less makes it a no brainer for those of you who like myself are addicted to dirtboxes i have noticed some price gouging with a few vendors on here shop around i knew the build quality was decent because i own the joyo vintage overdrive and they are both built like bricks this levy s leathers inch cotton guitar strap is good looking in an understated sort of way very well made adjustable and extremely comfortable and works exactly as expected we bought this for my son as a starter strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future highly recommended cfh reading the product description may give you an idea about this product i received plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion it s solid well made and looks feels like it can handle the world tour get it true meaning of the us dream it is hard with a soft overtone giving a sense of calm and well being wow yes that is it no more to be written joy o the american dream this pedal is terrific it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac the name is somewhat misleading although you can certainly eq your sound in that direction the real treat is the huge variety of boost tone and gain you can dial in its mindbending the gain is superb not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer this pedal is an audio swiss army knife i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar i used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly for some songs i have three sheet of paper which overlapped about an inch and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots i can t imagine in what situation i would ever need to use the brighter setting i was thinking of getting the cheaper smaller version but didn t want to risk it not covering three pages the gig bag is a square and softly padded there is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so i don t expect much protection for the light or adapter treat the light like it has no bag and you ll be fine they include batteries i didn t see them until i pulled out the adapter for this review to get you started using the light but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you shouldn t have to worry about it making it to your power supply this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product these people posted what seemed like a good price not ridiculously low on the us dream pedal it was to be shipped from japan they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazon com because the item was less than under the next best posted price and these rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn t make a killing on the item i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident it s the tube screamer of delay pedals i use mine primarily to thicken up my tone and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board i have used it for situations that call for deep delay and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey i fall back on a ehx memory man chained to an anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the delays in experimentation sequences but when playing blues or thrash i use it as tone beef only low settings not too echo ey more like a bass d out reverb there are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal and it is a testament to it s versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres hey stop reading this and order it now if you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about digitech effects pedals they ll tell you to stay away from them except for this one that s because the digitech bad monkey tube overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by boss or the ts tubescreamer in fact the ts tubescreamer is the pedal the bad monkey is best compared to this is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock but since the pedal works well as a level gain boost i ve heard of guitarists turning on the bad monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects to really push them to new levels but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the two band eq virtually any distortion pedal has a tone control that will make the tone darker or brighter but since one band eq basically takes away bass to add treble or vice versa you may not find the sound you want that s what s so great about the bad monkey if you feel like your tone is too weak you can fatten it up if it s too muddy you can add treble and you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like construction is extremely durable die cast metal and probably heavier than a boss pedal the switch is more similar to a boss than an ibanez pedal but i find that easier to use if you re a beginning player or a player on a budget this would be an outstanding pedal to own along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal there s really no need to spend the extra money on a tubescreamer if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear but even for player where money is not an object don t overlook the bad monkey it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you ll need
833	a very boring dull uninspiring pedal don t waste your time with this a boss sd or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedallike many other reviewers my gripe with the new pedals is the switch may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation i first discovered elixir strings when i purchased my taylor and i ve been a convert ever since they cost roughly two or three times as much as uncoated strings but are well worth it if your hands perspire when you play this product will keep your strings sounding new and fresh they sound great on my martin too the string are easy to play and sound great there is a reason they are used by so many professionals first let me tell you what this pedal can t do it won t do long delays so if you re into the sound of the edge from u or david gilmour look for something else expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile but if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience this pedal will not disappoint analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic users of mxr carbon copy swear by them but for around the rogue pedal will get you close minus the longer delay time i ve read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the belcat and modtone boxes the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal compared to my digital delay the rogue sounded warmer although my other delay has a switch for echo that made it warmer too this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints i don t use a long delay time in fact i don t max it out i only use about percent before judging this pedal please experiment on it s placement on your pedal board the user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately it doesn t sound good on my rig placing after the distortion pedal sounded better however everytime i use the dirt channel of my traynor ycv the tone gets muddy now it s in the effects loop just like my other delay the sound has better definition it might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion then after the distortion and finally the effects loop in your amp ultimately you and your gear will have the last say overall a good deal for the price i m thinking of setting up a smaller board of inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer play on i bought this based on video reviews on the net my first impressions to my ears if the ocd ultimate od simulates fat power tube distortion this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre amp with a bit of edge sharpness the kind of edge the tube amps have the focus knob seems like a tone knob maybe more in the upper mids than the treble but it does the job well i wish it had a bit more gain surprisingly this pedal with the gain on and the tone on gives me a great metal tone all by itself if i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost it gets me exactly where i d want to be a dry tight metal tone kinda ish and while this isn t the purpose of the pedal it is how i ve ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps it s tight its raw there is no fizz and no boomyness just a healthy low end crank the knobs on this thing to and you have a very aggressive tight tone that makes even my marshall class tight and grindy enough for scandinavian style metal over all though this is great for lightly distorted edge of distorted sounds it gave my clean tone a sharper more amp like tone that is midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle i think this would be great for hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff it just has that chimey vintage amp character very early marshalls older fenders with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation if your clean channel is overly flat this will liven it up to more sharp scooped tone which to my ears sounds more vintage basically from hendrix to modern de tuned metal with a definite mids emphasis not s marshall mids but modern mids emphasis
834	moen pedals are great nice quality at an unbelievable price point this pedal is no exception it is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch to be fair i have not tried many other vibes hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal that being said i am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere vibe is very trower like think bridge of signs chorus is on the mellower side very analog sounding not digital replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better solid well built and should last i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues my only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect i read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led s would fix the problem and indeed it did it s been fine since despite this needed fix i would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if i needed to fantastic pedal especially considering the price prior to this pedal i ve used an mxr dyna comp and a tc electronics nova dynamics compressor this is low noise compared to the mxr and simple to use it doesn t get as squashy as other compressors so don t plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output i bought these to go from my board to the amp we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating they are still going strong let me just start out by saying that i ve been playing guitar for over years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time i still own most of these units except for this one the joyo compressor my setup is a very simple one starting with a stratocaster to compressor wah wah super overdrive boost pedal delay then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb vibrato i don t want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i ve tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them this thing simply didn t work right out of the box while the outside of this stomp box is all metal the inside is full of very low grade parts from china loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board i ended up sending it back for a full refund i don t in anyway blame the seller they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again just nothing with the name joyo on it if you re only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware you get what you pay for it could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr but it does what it is supposed to although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked the attack knob the control for how much compression you want to apply did absolutely nothing i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one but none the less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made i m not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better but this one sounds exactly how i would expect a compressor to work it just makes things sound solid i ve watched the wave envelope it puts out using audacity and adobe audition and the compression works as advertised i swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts tube screamer you wont regret this purchase this is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers i ve used it for months with no issues at all it sounds great it works perfectly and it was as for quality control i have several joyo pedals and i can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome i ve never used a phase so the clone factor was a moot point when i purchased the joyo vintage phaser it works it s simple to use and i had money left over to buy more gear i ve been playing for years and i highly recommend joyo pedals if you don t like it get a refund it s not rocket surgery hosa patch cables are the best for the buck great sound and flexible i m a firm hosa cable fan love these little guys it seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk when received the package did not appear to be damaged but i have tried it on different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument i m going this stompbox as i always do based on the quality of the pedal and what it does not necessarily whether than tone is useful for my particular setup viewed in that objective light the joyo jf ac tone is an excellent pedal for to there are two ways to think of the jf and the other tech clones in this line california american british sound etc the first is the obvious one which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain this box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to clone a vox ac amplifier into the speaker how effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self at the end of the day if your amplifier particularly the budget solid state ones has certain limitations that you don t like too bright not loud enough too muddy breaks up too easily no pedal including a boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies but the second way to think of the jf is as a preamp where the output would go directly into a recording device pa system computer or tablet i don t have enough experience trying that though i did a little bit with the joyo california to say how well that works but i ve heard great examples of it online also having the convenience of amp like controls with knobs is certainly very convenient if you like to play record in that manner as for the sound of the pedal it s very good i ve heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up but i wouldn t let that concern you that s true of virtually any distortion overdrive pedal it can be cleaned up with a noise gate suppressor and i think the better use of this pedal is on the low and mid gain settings anyway the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp it s a very nice tone responds well to picking and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume which many pedal distortions do not do the voice knob is hard to describe basically it morphs the tone into something deeper and punchier as you turn it up but that also changes the impact of all your other settings including drive eq and level if i had one complaint about this pedal even compared to the california also a very cool pedal i was a little surprised how much this pedal wants to be dirty it s tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily but again i think part of that is you re basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo check out some of the youtube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder it could be completely different in that context at any rate it s a very intriguing device at only and i could see finding new uses for it in the future i haven t envisioned yet update april i actually sold this pedal instantly regretted it and then bought it back now that i understand how to use it properly by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp through the effects loop i am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal it really is an excellent value either as a foundation pedal or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a pa speaker system i won t be letting the ac tone go this time i have a love hate relationship with compressors for you can t go wrong with this one i use it a lot on my practice rig if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley knob i use a keeley in my live shows expensive but worth it as for this joyo i can t complain it does it s job pretty good but it does color your tone some what true bypass is nice it s noticeable in your chain but not to much to take it out i love for my practice rig good buy if you re on a budget all us musicians are just don t expect to blown away by it for give it a shot i did and don t regret it
835	joyo continues to surprise me this thing is all metal looks very sleek is true bypass and all around works well the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool the only reason i didn t give it stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch you can see the led on nearly every other joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look however it doesn t even show up in the product picture on amazon it wasn t a big deal i just drilled a little ish hold and it fits through for the price this lil guy does the job i got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables the pedal is somewhat cheaply made the jacks don t really seem to fit the housing so well but i do have it somewhat semi permanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue this converts an xlr signal for me a shure sm mic into a male i run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall this pedal is very easy to use retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied if you want to pay for patch cables and it somehow makes you feel more secure go for it otherwise pick these up great price and certainly gets the job done the colors fit may into your rig or perhaps you can use them strategically that feature is in incidental plus they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine i have been a gigging guitarist for over years now i own all the coveted amps guitars fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town i ve used all the roland cubes that are battery powered they were just fine on a lark i bought this danelectro honeytone i d read some good reviews and isnt much money i was shocked going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones but in my gig i have been using a boss me with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc looper and lastly my phone with all my backing tracks i play rythm leads and sing in my gig i connected all this to the single input of the n put volume and tone the same od turned off the sound is rich full and imho sounds just as good as my roland cube street i have all the volume i need and great tone the v battery lasts the entire hr set i am amazed by this amp this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used for direct recording it does if used with an amp maybe but however you use it it is sweet
836	i bought these because they were an add on offer and i m glad i did i don t play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass these are a little too soft for guitar check out the dunlops but i m going to make sure i have some of these around too the joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only so why not the first thing i learned about this pedal is it does what it s suppose to do but with some drawbacks there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal if you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you d be up the creek although it is a fuzz pedal is it does fuzz things then that s why i give it stars i deduct star because the loud feedback but in the long run i would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative this pedal sort of let me down a bit i really cannot find a musical sounding adjustment i can hear a small amount of octave when i adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switch if this was more of an octave pedal i would have been entirely more into the way it sounds i kept it because to be honest it is very cheap why bother sending it back it is a very good paper weight and i have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with it lets face it if someone breaks into my house i can whack them on the head with it and knock them out i just cannot get any octave sounds idk am i missing something joyo i like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth i got this from a direct from china vendor when it arrived the volume pot was not working it would only operate at about the first of travel and then die off i was ready to give up but on the second day it just started working so i don t know if it s a fair representation of these pedals i have two other fuzz s swollen pickle mxr classic fuzz to me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed the octave feature is a little useless for anything other than lead work and the mid cut makes it a bit nasal sounding don t get me wrong it s a pretty cool pedal but it s not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals but those pedals are about so if you just want to play around with a fuzz pedal this might do the trick but do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon all in all i think if you really want a quality fuzz pedal you might be better off somewhere else i own a few other joyo pedals that i love but to me this one is just ok i scored a virtually unused pre owned unit for it is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features but simple plug and play operation is possible my original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my pc my only gripe and it is considerable is that the unit sounds too digital to me particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade i probably would have loved this thing when i started playing more years ago than i care to admit i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals does that make me a gear snob not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days i ve also owned a tech trademark analog modeling amp not bad but traded and still have a tech tri ac analog preamp great pedal and a keeper both are modelers and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers i just prefer analog all the way around i eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar he likes it fine i gave stars because it s a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors i am not an avid player but it fits good and for the price you can not beat it i thought it would not be as good but wow my surprise to it and the fit i have a violin i think handed down from my ggggrandfather the violin is so old can hardly tell what kind it is someone once told me it was one of those stratovariouses tempted to throw it out a couple of times but it is sentimental since it came from and handed down through the family should just pitch the thing but now i do have a nice shoulder comforter will definitely keep the shoulder thing even if i do pitch the violin for a nice shiney new one tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar they are basic standard traditional strings they sound good they are light weight on this guitar they sound a bit too bright my preference is to use elixirs prefer the feel and sound on this guitar elixir polyweb acoustic guitar strings light these strings do not last less time than the elixirs mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar some people like a brand new set before every gig others will go weeks or months before changing if you are an every gig person well the martin set is probably perfect for you they are much less expensive than others leaving strings in for an extended period elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style so for the price these are an excellent value i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording practice having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere it works fine it is lightweight and feels sturdy only drawback i tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass and the preamps saturated in low frequencies input has to be kept within a small range this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only and it s built tough like a good effects pedal should be full metal case and solid construction an all around great buy this device sounds okay its usable but you should plan ahead if you re in the usa and want one it ships from mainland china it takes a while to get to the states i m not sure what i was expecting this definitely is a fuzz but the one i got doesn t seem to have much in the way of subtlety it s either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much it s not bad and it s probably just my personal preferences but this just isn t my cup of tea not the greatest pedal gives a really broken sound there is no mid way on this pedal either it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing the octave is a joke having said all that i could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance rugged pedal by a little known company took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye great univibeish old chorus device would like to see stereo output options in future models solid if you have a strat have studied jimi then it will suit you well if you ve got the right physical approach to the guitar itself awesome pedal i love the joyo pedals they don t break the bank and sound awesome glad i bought this pedal i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals i don t use this on my pedal board and don t know if i would recommend it for heavy live use i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here it does work well and will power many pedals at one time i do not use it for powering only one pedal though this device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals i also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet easy to use it is what it is
837	i ve got several guitars and capos this one is not too bad i would still prefer classic style seems like spring is a bit too strong price is great thou easy to use from day one and i am a beginner at the guitar would recommend it to any one this works very good on a silver flute it s soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it would purchase again no more misplaced or lost picks this handy little device will fit perfectly in any out of the way spot on your instrument
838	these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide tree installed on a tele i built much less surface of the string touching very smooth action when using the vibrato took no more than minutes to install reasonably priced super upgrade i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar these look like rollers but are not rollers they do work well and i will purchase more for other tele s and stratspros well made cons none i can think ofsleek well designedquick installimproved soundinexpensive upgrade fretted maple fender r telecaster tm style neck with truss rod this is one of many fender necks i have purchased from this company i have built several telecasters and fender p bass and stratocaster bodies all so far have been great to play the quality in the wood is great i have purchased womack s in the past granted there superb necks but there price is way over the top when i must replace a neck i think for the money this isa great way to go johnj the d addario sets are good stuff i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker the color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran with stretching they stay in tune fine the unknown truth about non nylon strings and maybe even them too is that there are only a handful of string makers and d addario actually makes them for other companies gore uses them for their elixir series and just adds the polyweb coating i also use the ghs standard sets and they are good too my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale i don t remember who makes what strings for what companies though with offshore production a standard thing now it s no telling where they actually come from anyways i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance the neck is well made the fit it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same time i did have to sand the neck a little it had a bump in it the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states
839	arrived on time and as described the strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come it is basic and not fancy it does the job is comfortable and the price is right i have four of these pro tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea so far forget to use it but that will come a three star at best i was not impressed with the finish or feel and i use a capo often you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product i think i got a great buy love the color and it has a strong spring holds very well great price i have the snark but read that this was the best so far i got and agreethis works better i would recommend it to anyone i have ordered several of these like or i love them they are great for holding picks make wonderful gifts a friend gives his time to help kids learn music he mentioned the need for one so got it it appeared to be built well and i ve not heard any complaints about the performance not very helpful sorry i disliked having to wait a month to receive what i could ve gotten at my local music store the capo does what its does these capo i know will lose their tension in time i thought i had chosen a different capo that s what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses can t hold tightly on st string low c a little buzz
840	i love this uke it came fast such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it i bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program i m a teacher not a student i have only used it with garage band but it works really well i have used it to record electronic drums bass guitar direct out from a multi effects pedal vocals and guitar with garage band s virtual amps i ve been very impressed if you really turn up the gain you will start to get a lot of noise but the noise comes well after you get past the point that any reasonable signal is clipping making the light turn red so with the gain at or so of the way up you get good clean signal with little to no noise the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short i bought of the same ziotek extension cable at the recommendation of focusrite one worked the other didn t so yeah best of luck with that focusrite should really have made a longer cable it gets in the way of the usb power plug a little bit and makes things awkward other than that i like it a lot it s easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly
841	not the greatest little pick up for the price im more than happy with its performance put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny i wont fit in the sound hole to i clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well cant beat it for the price this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles he was very happy with his gift for the money there isn t a better tuner on the market today this is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really this tuner is s pot on every time and super fast you can move from string to string quick lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best great picks sampler update received of these are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer it was held by only one small tac weld i got what i paid for cheap price and cheap product no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand putting a guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart not worth the time to send it back to amazon one star only for this product good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this less than one star for this piece of i m not going to gush over this one it simply works well for the price paid it has nice thick leather ends that hold onto my guitar well enough especially if you use locking clips you do use them right i like it and will use it again this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than day after it had arrived the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made i do not recommend this product just as good as any xlr out there considering i spent for it it rules will buy more when needed
842	this is a very simple product and as others have stated you could probably just diy one pretty easily but for this price why bother under and this thing is as good as ones that range from i don t think the material the time it is going to take for you to make one about mins an hour more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and voila it arrives two days later no fuss no muss assuming you have prime because well who doesn t these days plus this will look good on camera not bla bla bla this joyo pedals are the best any you get that s it thank u joyo im your number customer if you have never recorded vocals with a pop filter you don t know what you are missing this one works well gets rid of a lot of the little sounds and all the pops only bad thing is when it doesnt stay in place but its usually fine its a pop filter it works well and does the job however the neck on this thing is a bit long so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way otherwise its a good option at a good price i bought this microphone for youtube podcasting and it does a really perfect job the quality is great for me it was what i had expected it to be i also bought a desktop mic stand with it as well as a shockmount and popfilter highly recommended
843	pack of guitar picks check meet the beatles theme checkretail packaging checktwo day delivery got it the next day thanks to prime checkhappy guitarist checki can t really complain about anything except maybe for the price but then again i didn t have to buy these they are fun and kitschy stars the ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear it s built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time i ve had it since i normally power it with a wall wart i don t have much of an opinion about battery life bottom line it costs a bit more than the standard dunlop wah pedals it s worth it this capo seems to handle quite nicely spring loaded trigger like a kyser still my personal fave but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring in time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune the only issue if you could call it that was that i have always used the kyser s that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one after many years of playing muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit okay i bought a telecaster brand new back then still have it and love it i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and acoustics on my electrics i love extra light gauge strings only about of us do i can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings anyhow i digress but for a reason light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the found on gibons and esp ltd s when you squeeze the string to fret it with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board with x large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune the cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as s or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board so most capo s work with s and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings so a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone so since i use lighter gauge strings and even s are subject to the same limitation i have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp guess what now i found it i have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked okay so here is how i put it to the test i used the snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it i also have the peterson hd tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy okay back to the explanation with the snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side the only problem is that most any headstock tuner i have seen they aren t superbly accurate the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy anyhow so the secret to using the snark which i like best out of the headstock tuners i have tried is to tune the open string first and then fret the string on let s say the th fret you will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune even though it may be a little sharp or a little flat so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it so your ears can hear it in order to get it spot on there is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune so by tuning the open string and then tuning the fretted string once both are in tune it is right on so in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp not enough to register on the tuner when you fret that string for example on the th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit making it sharper which will now show on the snark as a note that is too sharp once you balance the open string and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument you don t even need to hear it so your audience is not listening to you tune up yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well so with that being said you can more fully understand why this d addario ns artist capo is the cat s meow it is the first tuner that i ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck it is adjustable like the others are but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well you often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo not with this one even with light gauge strings i must admit i was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on that it immediately did the job just right it wasn t even a little bit sharp to be super critical here is another tip when using this capo put it closer to the fret rather than in the middle between two frets for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so it has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets with gauge strings since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune the best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example rather than right below the third one right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also just like right above the second one does but it keeps the capo way out of your way as a matter of fact i am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords that i sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that to say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand you just slide it down to being right above the fret below it rather than right below the fret above it so there it is this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp of course if it can accurately handle s it will breeze through anything thicker out of the box it is set at its lightest setting and that is perfect for s on the telecaster i tried it on teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks so it will work the same with both so i guess i can t recommend this capo high enough since it is the only one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings my only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so i can switch it over when using a different guitar i might get another one for a backup this planet waves tri action capo is easy to use and features a micrometer adjustment knob to custom fit the capo to your specific guitar neck a feature i ve never seen on a capo before it worked excellently on several guitars i tried it on all with light extra light guage strings with no fret buzz or noticeable detuning after removal the pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too i recommend this capo without reservation knowing nothing about guitars except that my husband plays one i got this for my other half he was very happy with it said it was an excellent quality capo only needing a turn of knob to do what it needs to do he showed me how it worked how it gives a different sound to the guitar depending on where you position it i would highly recommend this to you guitar players my husband is pretty picky about his guitar stuff and i can assure you he was very satisfied with this capo highly recommended capos are not something that i shop for i have had two for years one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type it is similar to this one yeah in looks only this one blows that one away it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways this is great i play a tele and an acoustic martin it works great on both i play professionaly and this is the best thing i ve gotten in two years i am an acoustic guitar addict with five six string and one twelve i play every day and in a year s time i go through a lot of strings over the years i have come to favor the phosphor bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument for a long time i believed that brands of them were interchangeable so i bought whatever was available at the best price no more these d addarios are the sweetest easiest to play and not that this is the most important variable to me the longest lasting of any of the phosphor bronze strings i have used there is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened martins gibsons ghs adamas and elixirs as well as other varieties of d addario strings i think it s time to sell them off these exp s are superior to them all i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong to play as well as i am able i require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up sound wise i look for a blend of brightness and warmth on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar these d addarios do both things and do them well other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the slickness of these strings i simple did not experience that at all as with all guitar strings they should be wiped with a dry lint free cloth after each and every playing not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable i bought sets and plan to use them all both mediums and lights for my stringed friends disclaimers obtained free as part of amazon s vine program tested on ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players yes this tuner is for you i tested this diminutive tuner on sopranino ohana soprano pono concert kala string tenor pono it s tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there it s a bit problematic on the sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the top tuning is easy just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen if it s red you re off if it s green you re in tune when you re off little bars will display by the note letter left if you re low right if you re high tune in the direction needed until there s one bar on each side of the note and the note s name turns green quick and easy i ve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it s dead accurate as others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock but it s held together fine so far and i ve had it for weeks this is the best invention since the wheel as far as i m concerned it s easy to clamp onto my guitar head and the frequency not readings are quite accurate it s incredibly easy to use and very handy when re stringing a guitar not as bright as i would like them however very nice i can practice without lighting up the whole house i m glad that i bought it i take a medication that makes my hands shake therefore i have a difficult time with fine muscle movements i switched from dunlop jazz iii s which i loved to these puppies because they have a great feel to them and you don t have to worry about dropping them they are also bigger than the jazz iii s making it a bit easier to hold on to i have used d addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel playability tone and reliability this set is no exception light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone highly recommend anything by d addario i have played listened to and used audio amps for over decades and while i haven t owned every name brand amp on the planet i do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when i see one this is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar with an input for a mic xlr no phantom power and a cd player or other audio source it also has a headphone output inch it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs i got this originally for my mother who used to sing in an andrews sisters type group back in the day she still loves to sing and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam she hasn t had the opportunity to do that yet but i have tested the amp and put it through its paces i think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind the lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback but considering what i paid for it i can t complain now this is not a gigging amp at least not in my opinion your mileage may vary it is small solid state with an inch speaker and watts of power i haven t measured the exact output so i m taking behringer s word on that i like behringer and they can turn out some pretty good gear within its limits i like the sound of the amp with my carvin acoustic guitar with a fishman preamp it is an inexpensive practice amp so i don t expect the same kind of quality i would from a more serious combo amp the inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good inch no matter what the question is does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work composition or just moderate entertainment value for me that answer is a clear yes however this is an inexpensive practice amp and if you approach it with that attitude i think you will find it a nice little amp don t plan on using it for your next tour with manhattan transfer seal or celine dion after suffering through crackles lost signals and all the rest i decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through amazon com because the new acoustic electric classical i received as a gift has an end pin outlet i bought the spectraflex with the right angle connector although i have been using the cable for only a few weeks i am very impressed the connections on all the guitars and basses on which i ve used it are sure with no loss of signal no crackles perhaps most impressive is the fact that i can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal finally i can be confident that when i play something will consistently come out of the amplifier by the way the old school tweed look is a plus too i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn t know the clip didn t come with it so i had to order a clip later nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks it is also rubber in construction so it won t crack like the other low quality clips it is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is good i would recommend it i still had the original strings on an epiphone lp guitar i bought last november i know that s bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming it was nice to get these through vine and try them out there is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on it sounds cleaner and brighter i wish i d changed the strings when i first started learning to play because these are much easier to play now it s not much of an issue but it would have made a difference when i was breaking in my fingers those many months ago i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive i like the adjustable tension of this capo i don t think its as easy to put on a kyser capo of this style but once on the neck the planet waves ns tri action capo moves easily and has even pressure across the fingerboard a result of the adjustable tension i surmise some day i will use the pick holder not right away some night when i m feeling i need my pick held my wife myself are a celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed we considered a wireless to use with a battery powered crate taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet at these events no power is available when i saw this at the price offered and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered i thought it was worth a try in the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn t hear the stories in the songs we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost it kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood the result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show laughing at the comedy crying at the tragedy our tips cd sales have gone way up is it high fidelity quite simply no but in our case it works beautifully recommended just remember the price point and you won t be disappointed i have used this on my les paul it proved to be very functional the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact this one is harder to lose because of its size i also appreciate the even tension across the strings much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings i ve been playing guitar for about years now and i ve always used the kaiser capo but since i got this planet waves one the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case although they re both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort while i can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar less pressure is involved and i kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo that isn t actually barring down the frets is under the guitar instead of over it the product conceals itself well to those who aren t playing the instrument and it has great use i d recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there while the shure sm lc shure sm vocal microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship the beta a needs to be given its due the beta a is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin that is the beta a in the confined live scenarios in which i have utilized it has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues for vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high or really any notes the beta is a dream this same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or popping complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it while i wish that i had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon i can confidently say that the beta a is the best vocals microphone that i have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment quite honestly i would not be at all surprised if the beta compared well even in confined recording situations the bottom line is that the beta a might be more expensive than its popular cousin the sm but it is worth every penny anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority six out of five stars the planet waves capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos i used this capo on a gibson j hummingbird and a j i played it finger style and strummed with a pick the device is very well made and really looks like the best capo i own however the sound left something to be desired there was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless unless i really cranked down on the adjustment then is was still dull but passable it was a little better on electrics i tried it on a les paul and a telecaster it was ok but not the best of the bunch i do like the built in pick holder to compare this i tried a g capo kaiser and schubb frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb people complain that these aren t really rolling string trees despite the fact that the description never says or even implies they are in fact rolling string trees honestly they don t need to be at least for most guitars these small round guides are superior to the flat wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings less contact means less friction less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don t have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move i put them on a cheap telecaster copy i have and noticed the results immediately and i did not replace either the tuners or the nut those are still the cheap stock parts if you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot rollers might be a little better but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade anyone can change them all you need is a screwdriver it was a no brainer for my telecaster i ll never use another string on acoustics the reduced finer squeak the long lasting coating and the great tone of these strings is wonderful i ve tried a couple cheaper brands recently both coated and uncoated but come back to these every time this tuner is tiny and accurate initially the instructions were somewhat puzzling to me because there were no diagrams next to the instructions for example the instructions read press the tuner s release lever to open the tuners ratchet clamp uh ok i had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked after i figured it out i d have to say that i don t like this mechanism i prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp but i do like the rotation of the display as for tuning i had difficulty tuning the low e string on my travel sized guitar as a previous reviewer mentioned the display jumps around a lot even with the tip of plucking the string with a light to moderate stroke for my full sized guitar the tuning was easier but i had some difficulty on the low e string tuning my concert ukulele was relatively easy except for tuning the e string again proved to be more effort just for fun i tuned a full sized cello with great results but there was no easy way to clamp the tuner on another experiment i ran was checking out the tuner in a room with another instrument playing after tuning the instruments i checked the tuning against another tuner and the mini tuner was spot on although concealing the tuner from my audience isn t a concern of mine i would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern otherwise the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me this capo works just fine the only downside is the same as with most capos it requires some fine tuning to get it work on different guitars the only one i ve found that doesn t is the kyser my go to capo for years because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs electric thin neck vs thick etc easily the only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of use this capo has a similar pinch design spring loaded but doesn t adjust as easily to different guitar neck sizes it has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs this allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation but at the expense of ease of use it s certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming but it s not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songs so all said i still prefer my kyser it allows for much faster changing which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy but this might be a better option if you re in a studio or won t ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time or don t plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try i previously had one of those bungie cord like capos which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip it s disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune the schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck the problem with the schubb however is that it can t really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar in comes the planet waves it has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard however because of the adjustable tension you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness it might rule out the one handed ease but it does take care of schubb s problem of falling off in reality i only found that i need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if i move up way up the fretboard between the st and th fret i don t really need adjust however if for some reason i want to capo at the th i do need to adjust the tension because it s too tight in all it s not that big a deal and it s nice to have the option to adjust the capo in all i m happy no capo is perfect you can do partial capos with this one another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension in case you aren t aware this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars i have an electric guitar a nylon and a recording king ros with a chunky neck works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ros with that chunky neck since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard it does not work on classical guitars or anything with a flat fretboard the capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved it will not apply pressure on the middle strings it s a nice capo but it may not be what you re looking for so i recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos this capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune adjustment is easy and effective the same company makes a tuning capo which i find handy at times
844	i dont know what all the hype is over this thing the idea is good and its cute its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out how many of these types of noise boxes do we need not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it go buy a watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also or any combo little amp it s for bedroom use only you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot when i m in a apt i need an amp with tube at least the pre and a cabinetorange ppc x speaker cabinetas small as possible giving a decent sound and output w o annoying around and orange made my needs true i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this obviously in my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs i ll start off by saying that i m a proud owner of gibson es acoustic electric pono msd e blackheart bh h blackheart bh a weber vintage series a inch ohm watts in an open back solid pine cabinet a jensen mod inch ohm watts all tube fender tweed champnow that you know the gear i have what i can play through an amp and what i can plug an amp head into i ll sum up my review with this what you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab the cables you use and how clean your power is got good gear this little amp will sound great the detailsthe amp itself is tiny i have an electro harmonix pedal that s bigger than this amp still it packs a punch with the gain at about up and the volume at half i get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go yes this little amp will go from jazz country to rock metal with a twist of a dial the line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can practice time just got better for your neighbors the one lone tube in the micro terror is the pre amp tube mine came stock with a jj tubes ax i understand that s standard a jj is nice but it will not warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone dig out an old phillips rca sylvania or ge to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother i had an old ge made in great britain lying around and popped it in my micro terror warmed it right up cleaned up a bunch of high end tinniness still compared to my two tube bh h or my all tube champ this guy does sound more solid state than anything but compared to a buddy s roland and solid state ampeg it s downright mellow no effects loop means that your time based effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy so if you like pedals stock up on volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in speaking of power adapters a previous reviewer is right the external power brick for this guy seems fragile i m not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp it s holding up but one round with my cat and i ll be looking for a new power supply the rubannoyance one cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying hiss even at low volumes i found that out quickly so get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp i m running it with a gls gauge speaker cable and a planet waves american stage instrument cable both available here at amazon or any good guitar shop annoyance this is a watt amp right well if you don t run a ohm speaker you won t get all watts the micro terror self adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output yes yes don t quote physics to me at ohms i still get good volume but at ohms like my bh it sounds like a or watt amp that said i m actually a fan of the tone i get with my ohm weber in its pine cab the inch jensen speaker in my champ while nice can t put out the low notes like i d prefer and the jensen mod is too clean but the weber a sounds fantastic to my ears even with the loss in volume annoyance the micro terror is so small and so light it ll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord unlike a nice pound amp the chord won t pull out so be careful mitigation for annoyance the all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors though it will gouge your floor and then there s the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier if the power is noisy or ungrounded you will wind up with hiss no matter what i always carry a monster hts and run my amp through it that really helps in cleaning up signal noise if you don t have one get one the are cheap and they work the summaryafter all that i can still say i love this little amp i ve gigged with it and it sings well plus the added gag of tiny ukulele tiny amp always draws a laugh until i crank the dial over and shred some faces for the price you can likely afford to pick up worth of guitar speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig and for the price this is a solid star amp i know i m happy i have checked this amp out twice once with an orange ppc and once with the version with both a strat and a les paul and i am very disappointed in this amp now admittedly with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones so without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing bottom line unless you want full on distortion of the time you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp if you are committed to orange and boy do they make some stunning amps go check out the dark terror this is a very cheap little practice amp and i hoped i d be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my gf nuts unfortunately i have a couple of problems the headphone and aux quality really wasn t that great and using great phones the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier i just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be for quiet practice you re best getting a vox amplug imho sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
845	a perfect fit plus it comes with a handle strap and a nice sized pocket where you can store picks capos straps and strings its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely would recommend it have used it on a couple of ukuleles on my old dirty beginner uke that had been sitting in a closet unused for years it really made it look like new again i m satisfied it is okay it serves the purpose it is a good fit for the soprano uke a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place the case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case it will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty but will not provide much more protection than that this gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique definitely far superior to any of the other gig bags that i v ordered for tenor and baritone uke in this price range this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries we ve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it we are using an mp player for backup the sound is not quite as clear as we get with our roland cm so only stars from me the micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it s nice not to have to load up cart to roll around guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features this little gem is worth it s weight in gold so easy to tune with it we have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong automatic shut off helps too this stand holds up my ukulele so yay folded up it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the hola gig bag which i also use and heartily recommend make no mistake this stand is not pretty it feels and looks like cheap plastic but it does the job
846	this inexpensive capo works as advertised it s the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup this is so darn cool it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune and it works on so many instruments what else can be said about aquila high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best even if you have a very cheap ukulele adding these strings can turn a toy uke into something that wont embarrass you i use aquila and martin strings in my ukuleles the aquila for most performances and the martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional hawaiian sound as the aquilas are a tad heavier than martin even if this if you only have one ukulele and you won t for long you can t go wrong with these strings the e bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar great tool i recently ordered this ukulele and others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as i wanted to give them a few options okina uk soprano ukulele with rosewood fingerboard naturaldiamond head du ukulele naturalmahalo u or painted economy soprano ukulele orange lanikai lu soprano ukulelekala ka s mahogany soprano ukulelethe okina diamond head and mahalo were all under at the time and within price of each other of the three i thought that the mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality the okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own and year old ukuleles which had the original strings a string upgrade to aquila strings helped significantly but even then the okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level the diamond head and mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice for this price little gig bag incidentally what the mahalo product description says is a color matching brown gigbag ended up being black but black is pretty standard gig bag color the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the diamond head s that being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the mahalo since it s so near the same price compared to the diamond head and has better strings already installed i ve also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages i ve been using these straplocks for over years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot folks this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it s not going anywhere this is a must have just buy it i ve ordered of these and only one has been defective not worth shipping it back no big deal great tuner for my guitar class the snark may have a few more features but if all you need this to do is help you tune you re good to go i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy
847	this hosa cable is very well made with good quality connectors and a nice long length my son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected this cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable highly recommended cfh for the price it s worth it i guess if you just want to try it go for it that s what i got it for it sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals i would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal but for the price it s not too bad oh and the casing isn t like a wimpy plastic knife plastic it s pretty durable albeit don t throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps for those martins and sigmas as well as other guitars without a neck brace button this is the secure way to connect your strap forget the leather shoe string clipping that comes with some straps this is secure and won t ever end up with loose ends on the first fret nothing to tie or untie a quick button connection is all that s needed just make sure your choice of strap is long enough since the distance to the neck is greater than the guitar body doesn t improve functionality but the matching logo is a nice touch for martin and sigma guitars they all work and none of them have given any trouble my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around a lot i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great no regrets rock on took longer than i wanted but im in cali and they are in jersey so when i got the patches they were better quality than i expected so it was cool these patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like band aids kind of a gross plastic smell the smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first
848	i have had this stand for over years and still like it s compact transport capability since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping i ve used it at both inside and outside gigs without any problems this is a great little ukulele to have around the house i originally ordered a different one and got this one in error but musician s friend showed exceptional customer service and refunded me the entire amount of my purchase which included a change out set of strings and told me to keep it all too i was floored back to the ukulele at first i thought this was cheap enough to knock around and abuse but i found myself actually liking this one the action is fine and with a change of strings it sounds pleasant too i used the d addario j black nylon strings the tuning is a bit off but easily compensated it s a fun strum and well worth the the best tuner for your board in my opinion great display easy to view read and a simple click on and off that isn t noisy since it is true bypass the pedal turns off when it is not engaged which is a great feature since the battery will not drain while not in use even when things are plugged into it silent on off and i have two of them recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig this little fellow is great the proper connection from the focusrite comes with the box hooks to the usb port on my macbook pro everything else plugs right in no hassle with the right jacks and stuff my headphone jack was a different size but i went from to with a reducer i had on hand i can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program i ve been recording using garage band works great anytime i can get a product that works as it s suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff it s a star in my book oh there are two ports for speakers on the back side i haven t used yet just trying to decide what speakers to purchase pros price point can t really go wrong clean signal no self noise works for a tunercons for recording or amplification purposes this thing picks up a lot of attack noise fingers dropping on the strings bow clicks etc additionally the clamp does not always solidly grasp the instrument and shakes around a bit god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified for an item you can t go wrong i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume the pickup is very over sensitive also spend some time where exactly you place the pickup it makes a big difference try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something i quite like the sound of this thing running through a crate acoustic guitar amplifier it sounds really natural and it s easy to dial in a nice sound it s hard to hear it while you re playing you re better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you or trusting someone else to set the amp like most of these kinds of pickups it s quite susceptible to feedback so you can t get out in front of the amplifier and listen not a slam on the product that s just the nature of the beast i m an honest to goodness terrible violinist but i got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children it s a beginner class and hearing the right sound is really helpful it works great i don t turn it up very loud just a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room i hate the short cord and i wish i could use a regular instrument cable but i can understand that they don t want a lot of weight pulling on your violin but the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifier unless you use some kind of little pre amp in fairness the cord is a reasonable length but i m quite tall so it s of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder takes the edge off the violin sound i keep it on my office violin so i don t disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly
849	i have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar this little device gives me auto correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren t overbearing and the pitch correction sounds really natural now i just need more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound i m not a big fan of planet waves because they ruined the dare strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder wow i am very surprised by this pedal i got it with the intention of going aft that chimey ac tone which it does a decent job at i didn t realize everything else this pedal can do you can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem metal no problem crystal clear and punchy no problem super crispy tele twang no problem i tried it on bass and was really impressed it is eerily similar in function to my sansamp vt bass pedal and gets a lovely svt type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end i even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added od crunch in front of both my head cab as well as vt bass and para driver works like a charm turn the voice control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy while adding a bit of mid range response i only wish this had a balanced xlr out in addition to the normal out phantom power would be nice then also i would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there i have been thinking of trying the joyo di wit speaker simulation for this purpose but i just haven t gotten around to buying it yet in my opinion you should at least check this thing out i mean its when i originally went out to place this order i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function as i looked over that device and some alternatives i finally ordered the tc helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect how could tc electronics put out the mic mechanic with a pitch correction function that didn t do anything well those reviewers were right the pitch correction function has no effect also i couldn t see any effect between engaging disengaging the tone button i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects but i m very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it
850	this is the best octaver i have ever played through i bought my first one in and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive three umm density timbral tonal choices chorused only octaved signal mix clean octaved signal per setting which ranges from to octaves quiet and tiny footprint you d be dumb not to get one while they re cheap while this is not a tape delay it s a solid pedal that gets it done it s way better built than other pedals in this price range i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals i have owned almost every octave harmonizer pitch shifter on the market for what this tiny dollar box is capable of you cant beat it first off its polyphonic you wont find that in anything else under instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design only two flaws a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals still doesnt hum as bad as my pog did the only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static non oscillating chorus like effect it s fine for that as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful all the pitch shift settings sound like they re cents sharp this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it it s hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is i ve read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i m also tempted to get their green mile pedal if you re not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i ve tried to use the mooer pitch box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signal the pitch knob allows you to raise the note and semitones or lower the note by and semitones i found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the pitch box made the harmonies more pronounced making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable and in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organ when i had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar the detune mode sounds like a chorus but i almost never use it
851	works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help comparing it to my old boss tu dedicated guitar tuner this works just as good these are good for the average guitar player who doesn t want to much strain or pain on there fingers not the fullest tone but you wouldn t expect that with extra light strings sounds and feels nice i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster it came with entry level strings these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument be advised the low e string is thick when i try to depress the th fret i can t get it to register as a hit with rocksmith unless i press hard with my middle or index finger well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game
852	these are really great bang for the buck however like many people said they do not work well for all my pedals round ends don t fit in everything i mean these are cables i ve had behringer mikes before and currently have a couple of xm s which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm s i saw this three pack of s for in a hard case and couldn t believe it i hooked them up right beside the s and while there is a little difference it s not much the has a little more high end but it s easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass the presence is also boosted a little on the meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback for now i m using the matched s as the main mikes for our vocalists and keeping the older s as backups i bought the of these for less than the price of one sm although the shure and the b is better the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for i can afford to buy another pack for complete backup a wise choice for the budget conscious this is far more pedal than i need but what a fun pedal to have just going through the presets was fun but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner the bad part about this pedal is that it is huge and will take up a lot of space on your board you have to be committed to dealy you ll have different presets available at one time from the footswitches i can t comment on the looper as i never used it this thing sounds amazing except for one small problem at higher gain settings it hisses like a mother i m not talking about extreme settings just gain and character thats what tech calls it forgot what joyo calls it at o clock it has a beautiful warm singing lead tone better than any pedal that i have owned and that s probably distortion overdrive pedals if only it didn t hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal if you have a rocktron hush or other noise gate pedal it is worth considering the joyo is an exact clone of the tech british pedal which costs i don t know it the tech has the same hissing problem or not i have a home brew pedal board with pedals on it this allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems the blue led lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions not a bad price either let s be very clear from the start the pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality the board is solid and the bag is very well made and will last a life time as other people have pointed out though pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap d rings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder the only reason this is not a star review is because of the d rings that being said don t let that detract you from buying this i just feed the shoulder strap through the carry handle and it works well enough makes changing strings a whole lot easier if you are a guitar player and are changing strings like i was without one of these stop and get one trust me i got one of these and now a week later i have what a great learning tool simple and sweet this is a pretty strong cable i wanted something i can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case i m sitting on the amp the angle does the job seams strong seams like it will last i admit i haven t had it long but so far so good i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out couldn t find another cable so i thought i d find another solution with a more generic cable this joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition which made me a little skeptical i may never need all its features but for what i need powering devices it is doing the job beautifully my pedal board includes tuner chorus and octaver stomp boxes a bass di and a rolls headphone amp the jp frees me up from any other wall warts money now i just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board
853	put a set of these on my rogue grand concert now the guitar stays in tune beautifully worth every penny if you are ordering these to replace one or two of your gibson speed knobs you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to gibson s in all fairness these could possibly be better than gibson s stock seem to be made with a more solid underside but the numbers are a little bit smaller this is the only reason i gave them four stars fit perfectly on cts potentiometers and if you replace all four of them nobody except you will know lol all four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects as opposed to other reviews if you get these and they aren t perfect send them back until you get a perfect set it s free hope this helps not much else to say not much you can say about these they re knobs they fit perfectly and are of high quality finish they finish off my bass nicely as i like to have the numerals there for reference i ve bought three of these now this is an awesome well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily the most recent was for something rather unique a fanned fret compound scale eight string and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare there are more expensive options out there but for a non fitted do it all case this is the best bang for your buck hands down i am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs great case great price what can i say they look great and were cheap my kind of product bought them to replace the old vintage style knobs on my lp clone much nicer looking
854	i have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this i have only made a few recording but i am going to make a lot more very easy to use exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though design looks great in the light too this seems like a good deal for the price i have concerns about durability for anyone who has to frequently adjust the boom or takes it on the road because that boom adjustment joint is a bit flimsy i bought it for home studio use by just me so i am totally satisfied i got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue when i record a track either with the audio recorder or guitar amp screens in garageband on my ipad ios the recording is great but once i toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable here s the other part of this i can use apogee jam guitar interface and irig pre microphone interface and garageband behaves as it should and i can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever the focusrite support folks suggested i do a backup of my ipad contents and then do a software restore but i opted to return the unit instead since the apogee and irig both work perfectly with garageband so i don t know if the unit is having a problem with ios or i just happened to get a lemon but i ll find out when the new one comes next week if it works correctly i ll update this review after doing a few recordings but i would say if you ve just updated to ios or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit you might want to hold off on that upgrade update got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my ipad as suggested by a focusrite support tech and still have the problem i discussed above so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me if anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution please let me know
855	like my title says this gets the job done and is well built don t waste your money spending on premium brands like monster cable and get this instead i challenge anyone to a blind test who can say they can tell a difference get this it was awesome blu ray surround with the band was just amazing great extras too they were so much tighter on this concert than back in how the west was won i love the pick attack with these i have used almost everything out there over years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go to choice for acoustic guitar i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day the band s on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this to rehearse that long for this one show it s a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts with jason doing so well it was possible i could easily imagine ny sf rio paris rom tokyo etc
856	i ve been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now they have a great not too bright sound and you don t get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings these tend to last me about months so i am very happy with them they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great first of all its huge no like really huge but finally you get over that but seriously its huge the three presets are what sets this apart but this could have been so very much better why the midi clock sync implementation is flawed a the midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on off b to have a midi in and not be able to midi sync quantize the looper sigh like really this means you cant play with a drum machine sampler sequencer or play with anyone that does so while this offers some functionality above the flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays only one of which can be used at a time and can be used as a basic looper along with the delay defined by the knobs the downside is a very large footprint therefore buy if you have the space and either need the three presets or have neither a looper or a delay consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision both are weak after the fact implementations perfect replacement did have to take off a little on either side but other than that it fits i used it on a first act me it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable it has good lenght between two plugs you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals no manual you can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it s price i purchase such so i could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live don t believe this is what it is mean t for a simple delay looper will suffice this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
857	as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work it had been dropped on it s head after repairing and playing it it still sounded like crap so i had these strings they were cheap and i put them on only took about minutes to restring and was well worth the effort okay the guitar and i am too embarrassed to give the brand isn t my gibson les paul or my fender american strat but damn it sounds good now if i didn t have so many guitars i might keep this one but i will probably sell it to make room for another these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them honestly i won t restring my fender with them i ll use the fender bullets but these are great for about any electric with guitars crappy strings kill it great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great i will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars what can i say it does what it should pedals on a chain runs safely without crazy hiss and hum on my rig of course if you re running a chain of drive distortion pedals you re asking for it works great for me zero complaints switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm would have received a star rating had it been in a metal enclosure it is plastic but it suits my needs for the price i can hardly complain but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a fender strat replacement checked it against my american standard mim strat and squier and it would not fit any of them should have just used one of my dog s chew bones and cut it myself would have been more accurate
858	this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction two pieces easy to set up in seconds great buy for the only mine was a hamilton you should find another review from me but suffice it to say i just won t skimp on my cables when i spend s on amps and cabinets for good sound i ordered these as both a spare and to use with my lower end keyboard a casio px so i could leave my expensive roland rd nx in my home studio much to my surprise this cable is pro quality it s as noise free as mymonster rock instrument cable and i cannot tell the difference between the two cables when i am using this one with either or my keyboards the remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the monster model i ll give the monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction but where it matters signal transmission i frankly cannot tell the two apart part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise and i am sure that the oxygen free copper conductor also has something to do with it both the every expensive monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction i love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the monster it does a better job of holding flex to a minimum although the connectors on the monster are a better quality bottom line the monster cable wins out in few places but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk in fact i will probably keep the monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging for one thing there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one and for another this costs a fifth of what i paid for the monster even if you insist on using the more expensive cables this is a great one to have as a spare super sturdy well built what more can i say it s a sheet stand i didn t know when i ordered these mic stands that they were on stage stands they are fully adjustable great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics excellent quality i m very happy with this set these things muffle sound great they have good sound quality perfect for recording loud drums perfect for drowning out people
859	i bought a set of these from amazon s warehouse deals page with a discount because of some expected damage they showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise i was expecting some damage to the items but hoping that between the of them that i would be able to salvage enough to put together one full stand i bought these because i needed only stand with good height on it for mounting my lcd hitachi flat screen to it i use this tv in my studio so that everyone can see what s going on when we record and work on music i needed something that was going to be sturdy and hold the tv high enough that everyone in the studio would be able to see it all the time both stands showed up in good and working condition they go up to about tall and are perfect for mounting speakers onto although i use it to mount my tv about ceiling height which is about the same weight as my speakers if not more they work great i m going to add some pictures of my creation when i get around to it give me about a month for the money this is a great guitar case i bought it for a silvertone sd which costs about the guitar fits it fine i use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it i don t think i would take it on an airline they destroy luggage so i don t think it would fair well the compartment inside is large enough for picks strings capo and a strap with room to spare mine opens and closes ok and the lock works it is well worth the i paid for it it is a hardshell case about what i expected decent low end hardshell but serviceable i wouldn t check in with an airline i can lean on the top and push it in for a little extra protection over a gig bag yes don t put an amp on top of it in a van though just changed strings on my epi les paul and this winder cutter performed flawlessly the winder fit the winding keys nicely and didn t come anywhere near touching my guitar s finish the cutter snips the strings with no effort huge time saver and works as promised very glad i bought the planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer it works as expected and has proven to be durable i don t hesitate to drop it in my gig bag knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show
860	this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me this is a great package for beginners i never played a ukelele before but i learned to play guitar many years ago i have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so i downloaded an app called easy ukelele available in amazon and google playstore for free that is the only ukelele tuner i can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune i purchase this as gift to my son s th birthday that is coming up in weeks so i have not yet preview the dvd and cd that came with it i did however checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out my review the package the box comes with the ukelele beginners manual dvd cd carry pack and extra set of ukelele strings tuner is not included so i advise that you either buy a tuner or download the easy ukelele app i mentioned above the ukelele the ukelele looks and feels decent it has a sticker that says made in china it comes pre strung but it is out of tune i tuned it using the app i downloaded but it would not hold a tune it is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings basically the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments since the string is nylon i gave it a chance to settle i would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side i actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so i can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension the tuner pegs stays in place so i know that the problem is with the string it could be that the string included is a cheap one after doing this a few time on day i was able to play my first song i grabbed from the book clementine but after song you have to tune it again i just repeat what i did for the next days tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs yesterday morning i tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when i came back in the afternoon i checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key i left them in the morning i played with it for at least minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and i was able to play at least songs without any problem this morning i checked the note again and they stay close to the g c e a range i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more even if i have to tune it every day i would not have any problem with it so for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned just give the string a try to settle this are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in or you can buy a better quality string that costs around for a set another place you can check is the tuner make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension if it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little that is an easy fix the string as i mentioned above it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles even if you buy a good quality strings i am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning it comes with extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed the problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it from some research i found online they said that the thinnest string will be the a string the second thinnest is the e string the thickest is the c string and the second thickest is the g string the extra string package says gangia brand on it so i assumed that that is the brand of the string the book i just scanned the book and i could tell that it is written well for beginners the songs included progress from only needing chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons each song have a chart on which chord you will use the case the case will protect your ukelele from dust water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop the dvd s and cd s i have not tried the dvd and cd s yet but the dvd s i believe will have the lesson and the cd will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book i will come back and edit this item once i get the chance to watch the dvd and listen to the cd overall this is a great price for the package very pleasantly surprised buy this one i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well a nice strap for my lower tier guitars exceptionally well made this is a fantastic case for the money fifty dollars including shipping at the time of my purchase it has four very solid clasps one of which locks two keys are included it also features a plush velvet interior cushioned neck brace and a strap to keep the top from flopping back which could stress the hinges and perhaps alter the factory perfect lid to case alignment but best of all it fits my takamine jasmine guitar like a glove holding it secure and knock on wood keeping it safe from all harm i could not be happier use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon t leave home without itbut take and extra button battery
861	not much to say here but is really nice to have around hold my picks tight and has them where i need them this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders i ve restrung a dozen guitars in the past week including two strings and it is holding up well got this for a year old learning guitar they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner my how things change when you can see what is really going on recommended this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage transport and it cradles the guitar nicely two minor issues personal gripe the git leans back a bit more than i would like makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more d space than it really needs product gripe the two footer bars are not quite level with each other so it rocks just a little bit however with a solid body electric on it even a little rocking can be a really bad thing i like onstage and own several of their products they are well constructed and a good value so i have no doubt i was just unlucky with this one i ve been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it s getting better but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn t want to give much kinda sucks that it s not level out of the box so stars i have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others easy and quick no reason to be out of tune with these tuners the white is great but no matter what color they are they are a quality product rock on
862	i played with light acoustic strings for a long time i tried these and they make for much easier action do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings i ll probably stick with extra light for awhile they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers i have had several mxr pedals through the years i have always found their quality to be very good for the price in fact some of their pedals exceed the competitors products for less than half the price to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesn t mean it is that much better if you need a little tone sweetener this pedal can deliver with flatter eq s it is fairly noiseless but as with all eq s if you boost certain frequencies pretty high you will get some noise simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and road rugged for the price this is a nice pedal simple to use and built to last
863	i have been using this gig bag for the past few months if i do the math i probably didn t use it more than times basically from home to the subway from the subway to the studio and back so maybe minutes walk each time so i used it for about hrs and minutes mostly carrying it on my shoulders sometimes by one of the two handles then the side handle started coming apart the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking which i kind of expect at this point meanwhile i m going to buy another sturdier gig bag save your money and get something better than this it s plastic that s star deduction but in this case very pleased overall the effect here isn t to take off to another planet of sound but all set at middle o clock this pedal is awesome and really appealing several other combinations are excellent too check youtube there s plenty on this great price pedal for my first gig bag its ok i since then bought a new alvarez acoustic electric which i will be buying a hard case simply because the build quality and protection isnt there in a padded case i have had this padded bag for a year now with light use and edges are starting to tare and rip also i am concerned that the zippers might get stuck and break at any moment i will be replacing this with a hard cases as soon as i buy one for my alvarez i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself a couple of secrets to installing the mike pickup after you drill the hole and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar do this get a guitar patch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable you may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help also i did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothing finding a sweet spot on smaller guitars ukulele mandolin s can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small you can t get your hand in and finger length is as far as you can go so in most cases go in the direction of the low e string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have jimi hendrix hands and in that case congratulations finally on travel guitars get rid of the giant strings that come on some of these things my sx traveller came in with s and i could not even hear the low e string i had an old set of electric s i took off of a bb king lucille and just for the heck of it swapped them out man what a difference actually so much difference that i really didn t need the axl i just installed even though it s a fun addition as far as an amp i have a little honeytone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal and just may have found a home as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the travel guitar so while i got this for my soprano ukulele they fit fine not much to say really other then they are good strings and work
864	i own two of these the first did not have a compartment door so things just roll around inside case not happy but this one is just fine looks great no i would not take it on tour but as far as run around and taking lessons its safe all latches match up well enjoy will order again total flimsy junk it leans wayyy too far back i ll be damned if i put my guitars on these things on the other hand chromacast makes one that s very close to this price and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid in summary do not buy this piece of junk nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it happy buyer thank you very much works very well keeps the popping to a bare minimum easy to install cleans in a flash lightweight and works i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster the strat is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard with the light metallic blue and the natural maple neck and fretboard the white strap looks great i m very pleased with it a good solid case as for size it s designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars it could have better padding for instrument protection compared to similar product from other makes will do the job of good protection
865	one of the best tuner s out there it was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order very happy with this purchase i have acoustic guitar experience to a novice level but i have also wanted to learn the ukulele for quite some time as i had never so much as touched a ukulele before buying this one i looked for a low cost soprano to see whether i would enjoy playing such a similar looking but very different sounding and smaller instrument upon receiving this item i tuned it up and had a little play using a few basic chords i learned the uke sounded acceptable but i was slightly disappointed by the sound of the default supplied strings also at first as i expected the ukelele went badly out of tune quickly when playing but after a few hours the strings broke in and now keep their tuning with only occasional minor tweaks required of course most cheap ukuleles come with fairly terrible and cheap strings so it would be wrong of me to be too critical when this instrument cost so little i have now ordered some aquila strings from amazon to replace the default strings i e i bought theaquila aq s nylgut soprano ukulele strings i am still waiting for delivery on these and will update this review when i eventually fit them as to the difference it makes which i expect will be a significant improvement in sound based upon my research to be honest though the default strings on this ukulele aren t too bad so i may wait a while to install the aquilla strings until i can play more competently and get the benefit of them as far as the design and quality of this ukulele goes i was pleasantly surprised and impressed the paint job was blemish free and well done the unit appears to have been assembled well using adequate components and the tuner backs on the reverse of the headstock are decorative little gold dolphins which is a nice touch the unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument for the money it costs it is difficult to voice any serious gripes at all with this ukulele i m very much looking forward to getting more competent with the instrument over the coming months i really couldn t imagine giving this ukulele anything less than a full five stars it s great it s not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i m happy a little flimsier than the at but at the price it s good great precise tuning with the sn versus the other snark versions i would only go with the sn but like all the snarks they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart what a great multipurpose guitar tool it works great i really like the fact that it is cutter a winder and a pin remover all in one the quality is really nice next time i place an order i m going to get another one as a spare i d be lost without this tool they are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them i had earnie ball on previously and i might switch back or go to dunlop witch i put on my sting and love but i probably won t get these again ever returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it not durable spend a few more dollars it is worth it a little bigger than my other pick holder so the pics aren t as fluid sliding in and out great price though not as much padding as i would like my old bag had more other than that i like the pockets and overall design
866	forget all the volume drop comments there isn t any and it does not color your tone one bit i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in i wanted something to dress up slow ballads and of course born on the bayou this pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on i play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it both knobs at o clock toggle in middle didn t change the internal switches bam guitar sounds alive no more weak notes the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power no compressor pumping very minimal noise compressors by nature are noisy it just make the guitar sound better even and stronger compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal driven full distortion it adds sustain im sold now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic look it up on youtube i ve just received my mustang i and have spent an hour playing with it and the fuse software this thing is outrageous for a practice amp and i ve never heard anything like it in its price class and size with a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system i think you could probably gig with this thing one feature in the fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module post gain after the preamp this is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models in effect fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain before the preamp like a normal stomp box i don t know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the axe fx and that costs about times more power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why we re seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the fender champion and bugera v these days their problem is that they re pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes they don t have enough power for that so they re really only good for overdriven sounds not so the mustang i i think fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package this thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest it has the classic fender sound and feel of many different fender amps without the weight cost and tube replacement needs what s not to like okay so it s small easy to dial in a good sound very inexpensive made here in the us and has a wonderful transparency to it add to that the different ways to configure it by using the internal dip switches and you have a compressor as flexible as any i ve used for guitar at half or less of many cost which sound imho no better it stacks well with the ep booster and another comp boost in the chain too whether you want to drive your amp a little harder or just squash your signal this product is impossible to beat i totally adore it
867	it s sturdy and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position i m using it with a samson meteor usb mic which required some adaptation due to the meteor s short body which is a heavy cast metal mic no stability problems whatsoever one of the the best lights i own small but fills a gym with light for under what more could you ask as the other reviewers boast this is a great unit and i hope it lasts a long long time i had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk and since it was off to the side made it tuff to watch the level meters this clamp on boom serves the purpose but has a hard time holding the weight of my shure ksm condenser mic i tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it to keep it from sagging very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue i wouldn t recommend this if you re doing a lot of recording but it is sufficient for my home studio this arm hold the weight of a atr microphone fine it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect the packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works the shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts i did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me however it works great not too big and gets the job done tip just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit my atr is a inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around inches i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great the hde xlr to usb is ubs i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome i learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for send it back so i did thanks hde for wasting my time go sell your snake oil to someone else i
868	these are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job you do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind being s they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is i love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that they are made in the usa which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there put america to work get to picking i m certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product so they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past highly recommended simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capo this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use the c is probably the most universal of all the models this fits a les paul traditional gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar heritage cherry sunburst aprs se custom guitar grey black with tremolo bridge andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar vintage sunburstelectrics the primary use is for a laguna acoustic follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension it s key to not get too much tension we ve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo mostly it goes in a pocket once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesn t clamp tight on the headstock not a huge deal but a consideration i bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and i m satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second too many instruments for my own good still it could use some tweaks i d recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight especially on carpet where there s even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress it also protects against over tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars i can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldn t take much to tilt over forwards but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies especially electrics counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support making a forward fall unlikely still for sanity s sake i d position the stand close to a wall at first this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand but it s easy to rig up one or two inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort the design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it s not hard i fit an acoustic bass guitar a shaped ibanez artist strat sg shaped bass j bass a martin om a long neck bouzouki six string banjo and a nick lucas shaped recording king acoustic on it that said i don t max out the seven slots i ll use at most simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they re that close if i were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes i might be comfortable with six or even seven i wouldn t use this stand on stage and by on stage i mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it including a house party basement jam session etc it s simply not sturdy enough physics or no but for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it s tight to begin with we got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night he really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by but not too bright that it hurts his eyes a good buy i could see where this could be useful in other applications like on a music stand but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed i play guitar and bass but the gitpicker in me envies full time bassists because they almost never break strings and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings the price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics you don t know how good you ve got it and these d ad s are very good all round strings though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even normal nickel wound so they re not for sloppy fingers very nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge these flexsteels ring nicely and i like that the bottom e is a tad thicker at than the usual light set s because these are pretty bright that extra oomph is nice and i m a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that but if you re popping and slapping these come through loud and clear i really like the feel of the low e when i thumb pop with these i play a p bass with my index middle and thumb and these punch nicely at that scale length the pickups also like them and they get plenty loud with full definition and plenty of top end but not brittle with a trace elliot or other high def amp these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players i bet marcus would kill with them i think these are perfect for funk and excellent for almost all rock styles obviously flats are better for jazz but these make a good all around string and for less than clams they re a great deal i ve had my eye on a g th capo for awhile but this became available in the vine program so i decided to try it the capo was easy to pop out of the package the design is simple and easy to understand and use it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar the capo also has a handy built in pick holder this capo certainly meets my needs and i ve removed the g th from my wish list i was in a local music store the other day and noticed a huge stack of these cymbals with a few examples mounted on stands to try while they re not as rich as zildjians or paistes or other more expensive cymbals they do have that trashy sound that you look for in a china and at the asking price who can resist over the years i ve tried literally dozens of capos while some have been better than others i ve never had one i was completly happy with string buzz hard to place without being out of tune too firm not firm enough etc so far the planet waves ns tri action capo is the best one i ve ever tried at least in the short term it s worked equally well on my acoustic my electric it works on my octave mandolin and even though it s designed for strings on my rickenbacker string hopefully it will give years of faithful service for the quality is reasonably priced at this point i give it thumbs up recommended while i love and trust d addario strings i am subtracting one star because i really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once i think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound anyway these are classic strings that i grew up with but as i get more involved with playing having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated especially if you like to save your single strings for use i first want to mention that this is a pack of picks the product description didn t mention that but i was pleased to receive more than three my son told me he needed some new picks and since lately he s been playing ozzy osbourne songs i knew he needed a better pick than the standard fender picks he s been playing with for three years after hearing him play with these picks i ve noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these the finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks i wish we could choose the color or maybe they could send a color assortment we ll be buying these for a long time to come strung these up on my lp goldtop with p s d addario promises these strings to be comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations that result in greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings i dunno anything regarding the science behind this but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker a and d strings compared to the regular set of d addario s they offer its not a huge huge difference but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance for one thing they re pretty stiff they bend but not easily maybe that s what they mean by balanced tension they re also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated s not flatwound mellow by any means but not quite as bright as your regular set of s i do get a great rock tone out of them mind you but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound personally i like the tone i get out of them they re big and warm without being dull sounding but again your preferences might differ one thing that s great about these strings is once they re properly stretched they stay in tune forever again maybe this is part of the balanced tension and if so good job d addario i haven t had them on forever to really see how long they last but they ve been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one who would these appeal to well if you like really light strings that bend easily you re not going to like these if you re a rythm player who does long gigs the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you d addario strings are like the kias of the string world they make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time these strings are ok i ve always been partial to nickel wound particularly semi flatwound but i digress my typical strings are elixirs so i m used to them lasting a long time in this case the strings sound good like most nickel strings do but they didn t last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless and stopped keeping intonation accurately so like most d addario strings so they re not bad but don t expect them to last like elixirs do you get what you pay for there s not a whole lot one can say about a guitar strap but i ll try this one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some i ve tried it s fairy thick and the material doesn t slip around on your shoulder easily aesthetically the woven print is abslutely beautiful the photo cannot do it justice the colors and rich and vibrant and the weave is tight not chintzy or frayed i m very pleased with the product and the price the d addario exl bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great i ve been a long time fan of d addario strings and these strings did not disappoint they were very easy to string my fender strat with and stayed in tune a good long time the strings had a good feel to them as well where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords you know how you have tuned your guitar and it s tuned as well as it s going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesn t sound right you check the tuning and it s tuned alright but why isn t it sounding right these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords bar chords were terrific too impressive i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
869	i love the tone do your research though plenty of distortion plenty of bass and treble makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter i love this stomp box although i never stomp on it needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you my amplifier doesn t have reverb so i route the effects send to it and leave it on it has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldn t think about playing without it this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop it doesn t take a lot of space on my pedal board and it s simple to use i ve used the boss rc and the digitech stereo jam man although the others have more features i like this little pedal it took a little time to get use to the one button operation but i find this to be very reliable i ve owned mine since the day they came out and i have had no issues cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way it is very safe for guitar finishes having a neck heavy epiphone sg g i really like this strap because it is not only comfortable but also provides enough friction to keep the guitar in place without much effort leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button i bought this hoping it would be a no frills looper and that s what i got it sounds great and the level adjustment works really well i can layer even as many as or layers and hear every one without problem i give this five stars but i have two minor quibbles that in my mind don t take away from the rating but might be important to some there is no included power supply if it doesn t take batteries that s fine but give me an adapter this thing was over a hundred dollars don t force me to buy an accessory just to power it up personally i wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added not just removing the last layer or all the layers i d like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer moving to a crescendo and then back off the layers one at a time eventually returning to a single layer i played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it i started with one part and then added layer after layer until i had a really big intricate sound it would have been nice to be able to then take it back down to a single part and then quietly end the song this is a wonderful little looper you won t be disappointed this is super warm and can get very trippy i like the depth it adds to everything from subtle extreme and whatever else the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too nice extra milliseconds really is more than enough and i have a highend tape type unit that is something like seconds but for what this does more than enough i like retro and this is it i used this on a show the day i got it and it was noticed by all i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal again do your youtube homework and listen around and you ll come to your conclusion amazon is great to deal with for performing i d go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price would definitely purchase it again tc just does things right i love how easy this is to use the incredible clarity of sound and minutes of recording time i do a single duo and full band it goes with me to all gigs and i do use it for when i am practicing highly recommended solution this is a pretty hot pedal honestly i have compared this against a suhr riot distortion and an mxr classic distortion and quality wise it is really really hard to not hear the difference in terms of quality tone distortion overdrive great price and well made joyo nice job here this pedal i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin wow it cranks it really will produce marshall plexi tones especially noticeable in the lower registers on the e and a strings if you want a marshall stack sound this is it if you wanty a variety i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions so you can chose any amp sound you need really people for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make and they all are super i realized i didn t have any distortion pedals only a bunch of overdrive pedals so i set out to find a distortion pedal after scouring the forums i find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey since i don t want to spend a bunch of money i get this one and it is great albeit quite bright the only thing i don t like about this pedal is the brightness which can be tamed with the tone knob otherwise it is easy to use sounds really good and is transparent transparent in that it doesn t add a lot of color to your amp just distortion i use this pedal with vintage fender silverface amps which are already bright so i turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the spark booster that i have in front of the us dream i have to use the spark booster to hit the us dream hard because most of the guitars i use don t have hot enough pickups the price was right i m happy with it one spots come with an pedal multi plug if you only have pedals or lets say you have powering them with an plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly the left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren t plugged into pedals using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff great price great purchase unhappy with it actually i already replaced them the method of attachment is poorly designed it doesn t matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions expensive locks too let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal and tons of fun i can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live but and this is a big but this is my first one star review ever my first less than star review ever same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it used less than ten times total light use at home i wasn t even wearing shoes by the way a gigging recording musician for over years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff bummer too great idea poorly executed i will not buy anther one i will not recommend to other musicians this is a very simple product but one which fulfills its intended purpose of hanging guitars on the wall this fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths the swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck great pedal get it you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs great tone dont waste your on others with similar specs i had previously owned it digitech jam man i also try the boss after seeing demos of this item on youtube i decided i ll give it a try i can always return it if i didn t like it the unit is extremely small but don t let that fool you this unit is a high quality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly you get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs let s be serious how many people really loop for over five minutes the unit is transparent when turned off i would highly recommend this looper it s well worth the money these were the strings i started on a year ago and have tried a few different brands in this time frame they hold up imo as well or better than most brands i ve tried especially for the price i probably change my strings more than necessary so i have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality these fit that requirement well i bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio most of the band members don t mind them its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes recommended
870	solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear our radio station owns several pieces along with this unit and are expanding our gear with more purchases of behringer gear super value i ve tried these out in head to head excuse the pun runs versus steelseries plantronics panasonic and sony headphones that all cost more and the tascam th keeps up i m really surprised at how well they perform lows are good mids are clean and highs are crisp yes the lows could be a bit beefier but out of the headphones i compared it to only the plantronics excelled in that area for fit i have a large noggin like size hat and these headphones fit well not too tight snug but not confining the padding is good and soft seriously i d rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break which they haven t and i ve taken them everywhere than spend on another set these headphones get the job done i like the build and design very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs these headphones are amazing i could not believe the sound quality i have been an audio engineer for over years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price no i do not work for tascam the first pair i bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily so i ordered another pair because the sound is amazing i just need to be more careful next time but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction i have yanked my senhieser s millions of times and the cord never broke so be careful with the cord on this headphone it is not the best but the sound is superior i only just received these but thought i d give my first impression i purchased headphones because i figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in ear type i chose this model because they were on sale seemed to be a diamond in the rough and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads i wear an xl hat size the build is average they don t feel flimsy in my hands but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special strength wise the padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head it sort of looks warped the meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone the headphones can both swivel degrees forward maybe degrees back and degrees downward the swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband i listened to about minutes of music straight to start and was pretty pleased i m not especially particular but do like good sound there s some good bass classical music was clear the headphones did make me realize i had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that i tried out listening to the hd equivalent on youtube cleared up problems i heard i wasn t totally blown away either i do hear a little noise when they re plugged into my computer and nothing is playing though not so for my ipod so i m not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones they are comfortable but not as comfortable as i d like i do feel some pushing against my ears the round ear pads aren t big enough to fit my whole ear they do get warmer than i d like i definitely feel relieved to have them off i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour i was a little hesitant to get over ear headphones in fear of this and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem who knows maybe they ll wear in and improve i ll update this review if i have more to report for now i d say they re worth the cost even if they aren t a shining diamond in the rough if i could give about stars i would but for now i ll give they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons update i ve been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days it s helped a bit what s funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge it s comfortable on my head at about the rd of the size notches but the pushing against your head is the tight part if you adjust them larger they just fall below your ears rather than loosen up also i compared them to the sennheiser hd the tascams have better sound but the sennheiser is more comfortable they re lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better update i think the box stretching has been helping i m able to wear them for about hours now before i notice them getting uncomfortable still a relatively short amount of time update the headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren t in use the comfort is marginally improving i m guessing due to the stretching out my head ears getting used to the pressure and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure however i think my rating will remain at stars the sound is good enough to give it a couple stars and the price low enough for one more however a month should be long enough for the phones to break in to a standard usable degree and that hasn t happened to my satisfaction conclusion i would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head mine is about cm circumference or us hat size and the clamping definitely leads to discomfort the round ear pads don t quite do the trick and it makes your head pretty warm it s not unbearable but if you can find an alternative it s probably best that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit i can t speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head and ears if these fit comfortably which i imagine they would for many people they are a star product great sounding sturdy enough build etc update a friend of mine picked up a pair of audio technica m s around the same time i bought this pair and i was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today i m not very experienced with sound quality but i felt that the m s were definitely the winner the most obvious difference was the added volume but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less static like etc besides the volume these differences weren t huge i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them the point of this update is just to say that you aren t getting headphones for with the tascams you are getting very good headphones the sound of which should more than satisfy most people i think you re pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones in this case you d pay x more for the m s but i don t think you re getting x the sound quality the m s are significantly more comfortable though they do make your ears warmer and the build feels better stronger smoother adjustments prettier etc all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable soooo bummed i simply love the sound on these cans but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface not deep enough in the cups and press down hard on my ears the max time i can wear them is like an hour and then i can t wear them for a day or so due to residual pain i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help also on most of my other phones the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet so it s kind of like double trouble however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity if it weren t for the discomfort factor i would be using them all the time as of now i hardly use them at all in fact when i first tested these out i was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more but i m glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test of course we are all of varying shapes and sizes ha ha so they might work for you where they don t for me if so you ve got a bargain on some great cans if not ouch cheers
871	i really like these use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it but once you got it its a fine product enjoy so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks i tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe but alas i was too slow it s a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a carlsberg bottle cap so the fender ones will do just fine plus they come in colors and say fender time to open another carlsberg cheers fender my epiphone sst classic didn t have the strap pin so i took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place as i don t want to do another hole to my guitar i left it there but i m afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground so i bought these fender strap blocks and i use it on my two epiphone guitars that i can t use the planet waves strap lock with my other epiphone guitar is an epiphone hummingbird they work great i would buy these again this is a good product these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on i like an amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar months and no problems yet
872	its a good amp im happy with it the high gain is not the best a lot of unwated noise even while playing and i see a few people on here have had the same problem but i mostly play punk hardcore and blues which is does very well so when im in a metal mood i use a boss metal zone pedal on a clean butcher seting and no unwated noise even at loud volumes so its good amp i just wish i didn t need to use pedals to get good metal sound thats why i got this amp so could get rid of my pedals o well i have the fender mustang iv and i would say the fender is a superior modeling amp but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get the bass sounds great and when i played here comes the sun on my acoustic i d swear the tone sounded like the beatles record the modeling sound is ok and they tell me there s a looper here but i d have to pay an extra for a pedal to access it oops there goes a star for the con job peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less i ll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future i love this little guy clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you it will still accurately tune the guitar very easy and simple to use i paid for it and it is times better than the one i have great build quality works like it should feels comfortable to wear also no complaints at all great color also considering my guitar is a shade of green d i ve owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable i keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs
873	perfect for remote recoding with up to head sets clean amp and plenty of gain at a great price the us works fine for my needs rough and ready audio tracking with bit cubase on bit windows my pc is for general use with a non studio configuration no mixer non phantom power mics headphone monitoring if you re buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs you ll need a separate mixer and or standalone phantom supply from the mixer you can cable to the us s line input via rca jacks on the back there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i don t blame the device it uses stock o s drivers that loaded right up the documentation is minimal and only covers up to vista but it s accurate and you ll manage with win on the windows side make the usb audiocodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card based audio and speakers i have realtek onboard and desktop speakers i m using asio all with cubase and cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring vst connections and i o busses once configured however it s been solid i d recommend checking out user forums for your particular software platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations on an xp machine changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the daw on win once i unplug the us the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers if i plug the us back in the settings revert again very reliable even better if i want to use cubase strictly for midi the software detects the change and i don t have to reconfigure connections or busses that may be a function of cubase so again it pays to research your particular software while the us is connected you ll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the us s headphone jack or audio out rca jacks this is where the balance control is very helpful it s not a pan it s a center position gain mixing the computer s output from within your daw as well as outside system sounds with direct monitoring of your input signal very simple to use for overdubbing some people may prefer a hard left right pan while overdubbing i can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature if you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done there are a number ways to go unplug the us and restart your daw run a cable from the rca outs on the us to the mini jack aux in on your desktop speakers run a mini jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the us to the aux in while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and vis versa rather than having to pull out the headphone i would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output but i can live without it again the us works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities you can t rely on the product description or packaging to answer that fortunately there s enough user information out there for just about any setup it shouldn t be difficult to track down i ve used dunlop jazz iii s for years but always had a problem when it came to a song that required a lot of strumming the dava changes that for me not only does it allow for accurate picking but it also allows you to strum when needed just roll your thumb back a little works great i ve been using this pick for about months now and have not gone back to any of my other picks a definite star for being my favorite new pick you won t be dissapointed as with any new device or toy we buy we discover the good and bad points first the good the good tracks that can be recorded at a time has rca outs which is good for monitors and or headphone amp as well as a headphone out a durable feel a nice design xlr inputs with phantom power lit screen to see better very nice wav bit khz recordings auto punch in comes with a gb card and can take up to gb sd cards has effects has a metronome mastering internal track apart form the tracks built in guitar tuner eq compression in and out nice dual stereo up front mics that are real good sounding and all track mixing bouncing to of your tracks even the tracks that are bounced to the previous tracks that are there that still are plying bounce too very cool and much more the bad short battery life no ac adapter included need to buy cheap off ebay around small buttons bad sounding reverbs auto punch in gives you seconds after pushing buttons to record come on tascam seconds i can t get back into recording part with a guitar in lead in seconds all alone no guitar effects or drum patterns like boss s br micro and boss has it s problems too believe me sometimes it just hangs up think there is an unlock or reset pen press thing on the side horrible reverbs moreeven though this untit has its good and not so goods it is a great device you can import and export songs to this to and from your computers recording software remember its bit wavs only to and from daw tascam please lengthin the auto punch lead in from seconds to seconds or more on next firmware and dont make another new unit just to improve what a firmware can do jim
874	everything keeps improving and getting better faster and cheaper but at this price point their isn t one available that isn t a compromise in one way or another first off if you are planning on buying the us don t buy its bigger brother the us getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money as well as k makes it a no brainer to get optical on the only at this price is great but the a d d a converters leave a bit to be desired on the other hand the mic pres are pretty good have distortion ratings thd of only and with bit khz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by tascam to date what i meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost to times this price most of them have either good mic pres and weak clocks or vice versa and some work with windows but not so well with mac and once again vice versa etc i researched interfaces for a long long time and considering non crash reliability and a dozen other factors i finally sprung for anrme fireface ufx usb or firewire high performance audio interface in out now that s an interface i have been running it with pro tools since pro tools professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and pro tools is now being released so if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope i would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this tascam us or so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved so what i did was load and register the free and included cubase le complete with activation and elicense registration and installation as well as installing the tascam driver and doing updates for both i know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing daw in order to test out the interface and therefore they didn t need to spend much time with it i don t blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line so get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn t happen in just one hour so here goes if you have windows vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list windows xp and i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake i know mylogitech audiohub notebook speakersare non functional in my vista laptop if you are running windows media center in it as well it works in win just fine so i installed it in my desktop running windows bit and it gives you the option of installing in or in addition to cubase le it also installed ai elements as well as agent one content groove agent one vintage beat boxes steinberg drum loop expansion which took a good amount of time to load as well as steinberg halion sonic se bit for ai elements i then had to activate and register cubase le which involves installing the latest elcc creating a steinberg account which is free and they don t ask you for a credit card they provide you with an activation code after you register i have an ilok for pro tools which is a usb device that enables you to run the program cubase does not require that you have one although they have an equivalent looking device but fortunately they have a software based equivalent they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version there is an elicense control setup and you have a soft elicenser number that you will use in order to generate the activation code generated at the steinberg site what came on my disc was version which they instruct you to immediately do an update which i did to version so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd included with the interface is a foot usb printer style cable you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer windows recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update it took at least minutes to do that update what flashed on the screen was megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving at first it says this is going to take a long time and they were exactly right it almost tempts you to think something is wrong because nothing is happening other than the scrolling and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says do you want to install and you click continue and then it comes up again in another minute and this happens a few times and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash then you reboot now this is important plug the us directly into an available usb port and not into a hub even if it is a powered hub it simply won t work i tried it and the light wouldn t even come on indicating usb when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb the us comes with a printed quick start guide there is also an owner s manual for both the interface and cubase that are available either on the dvd or by googling the same and they come up as a pdf download if you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading there is a driver to choose input and output settings as well as going into windows control panel sound in order to choose the interface for playback and recording if you re new to these kinds of setups just take your time and don t be dismayed if something doesn t work all it takes is for one button to get pushed and wahlah you have sound for example in cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won t get any sound from the headphones if all else fails you can go to the tascam web site by googling tascam us and then click on the support tab and they have a you pay for it phone call number in order to help you hope this helps ps the real killer deal right now is avid pro tools bundle with the mbox mini which is another limited interface but you are getting pro tools plus purchases of this bundle made after that has pro tools will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools if you register your product with avid considering what pro tools goes for by itself and what the mbox sells for individually and the bundle even comes with the ilok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts i have seen pop up as much as off the already low price then you have pro tools and full blown versions none of this le stuff and an interface and can grow from there this tascam interface works great with pro tools these pro tools bundles are discounted to make way for and i am seeing music stores running out of them they are clearing the shelves preparing for but it has bugs i rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some and get feedback from users after some time and more updates i will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to maybe in another year pt is all i need while the tascam us audio interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included cubase le software i am not a novice at home recording as i have used many devices from track cassettes to protools setups over the years here is a rundown of my disappointing experience plugged into my ipad using the camera kit usb connector got device not compatible with ipad message too bad but i can still use my art usb interface which works quite well with garageband installed driver on my old g mac running opened garageband got no input message could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os if i get a new computer i will update my review until then i m disappointed this unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording it is powered via the usb bus so you don t have to carry power supplies or worry about finding an outlet for the device one issue is that this is not a plug and play device you will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it after the driver was installed i was able to get pro tools to recognize it right away without any issue i recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded it works like any other interface in pro tools so you will be able to use it easily enough the mic pre amps don t seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a v condenser microphone like the ones i use to record vocals and guitars i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay i wouldn t want to use this for anything important but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals or doing pre production in a practice space i wouldn t recommend it for serious studio work though and i would rather drag my pro tools i o rack to a location if i was in the field the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well i noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when i picked it up after taking it out of the box it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound this can of course be taken care of very easily but i would rather have a device come as it should i have never had a problem with a tascam unit before and i have had a ton over the years so i hope this is just a one off quality control issue the knobs feel okay but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky bottom line starsrecommended for casual use but not for commercial use they still work years later i ve had to change a few batteries but they last a long time fabulous tuner even works on a stand up bass just clip it onto the bridge excellent product
875	great product with nice feel and tone i m only sorry i pre ordered only two sets at the average price now is and over i ll bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings these are durable and long lasting recommeded wow i will never buy another sm again i can t believe i m writing this but it s ture i am so psyched that i found this microphone it s perfect but seriously the sound quality has never once disappointed me in fact and it might just be in my head but i now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp but everyone else has talked about sound so i want to talk about build quality it s solid has some weight to it and the plastic at the top feels exactly right so far it hasn t come loose in the way that sm s do if i handed this and a sm to my grandma who doesn t know any better she d probably guess that the es was a bit higher end i continually look at it and can t believe i only paid for it get one nah get a bunch sell your sm s for and turn them into two of these magic
876	these are durable but i get some noise from the cables it s barely audible but it s distracting nonetheless the cable is good and normal good price and works well the rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and i have to push them in place all too often satisfies my needs nice cloth covered large strain relied good plugs put a bit of thread lock on them they unscrew almost unintentionally like it even if it s a bit long for use at home a friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord lol the cord delivers good sound quality the only problem i have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar first of all this is a guitar stand it s not a high end pro stand that being said the materials are decent it seems strong and stable i would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig i bought it to have a convenient place to keep our guitars and basses handy rather than having individual stands this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neat the metal is decent but if you tighten the screws too much the metal does flex warp so far so good
877	this bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount i am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an ernie ball strap the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest works great easy to use good quality and doesn t cost very much the price is great too glad i bought it folds up well has a black finish on it i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon i wasn t planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar the way the military palletizes all of its cargo i figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it but i took the chance anyway it arrived intact and ready to play the strings are a bit cheap but the guitar itself is well made and has a really nice rich tone i was planning on giving it away when i left but i am shipping it home instead and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home but it is worth it this one has worked out so well i am taking a chance on a string soon to arrive in theater i bought this for my acoustic bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo holds my bass guitars easily as well works well at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
878	for some reason when i saw picks i think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks what i got was a slim resealable bag that s about th the size i was thinking of it comes with light medium and heavy picks even the light picks are thicker than the thin picks i had ordered before i like having the variety though this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness the only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so i could maybe hang it from my strap just love them came really quick love all the different colors and thicknesses in all the colors you can fined a fine med or heavy i just put this on my dot hollowbody it s a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job i like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it the price was great had the gibson name on it and was a great value stars love my assortment of picks and the price was right i like that their is different gauges because i don t always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but i only received instead of picks but whose counting i m still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again thanks strings are not just strings guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar and all martin products are second to none this unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders i ve restrung a dozen guitars in the past week including two strings and it is holding up well
879	i have about quit using picks now but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses that s what you get with this from very thin and flexible to and hard you get a selection these are really cheap strings but how they sound really good obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse these are the ones if you re looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case this is it for the price it has better padding than i expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps good deal for the price i have heard good things regarding this pedal so i was always interested but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it when a buddy of mine who happens to be a professional musician began talking about it i said i think i d better check this out im glad i did boys and girls time to break open the walletsgreat tone and drive within this little boxyou ll be adding it to the board just like i did duriong my lessons my instructor talked about several models of tuners that a guitarist can get some are old time one still with a kick and the one he recommended was the snark nor the shark and that is what i thought he said when i first heard it there were several kinds of tuners and i was looking for a good quality made of sturdy materials and was in a good price range the snark i chose has been working just great for me great value
880	just got this in this week looks nice and works as intended for bucks can t really go wrong i use this with a behringer c and have had no trouble getting it to fit it s a bit snug but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit i have countless delay pedals and racks this inexpensive delay is very special it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay it won t give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for it sounds great clean or dirty it s a relatively short delay which is great for many genres long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal eric johnson like music i would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment it s bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you ll be near the dark side of the moon many musicians use two delay pedals i know i often do this one is my main delay and my nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for the unit itself seems sturdy and well made i use carbon zinc batteries in mine they just seem to sound better to my ears keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time true bypass and no hiss great surprise as i never took rogue seriously never thought it d be my goto pedal i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars i m surprised i haven t broken it yet
881	best strings for my ukulele these are great quality i only use aquila strings on my instruments highly recommended my ukulele has a better tone with these strings i ve been able to purchase of these in different sizes for all my pickin pals lightweight easy to transport in the back of your amp or just put it in a bag with your music these are good values for the money and do not fall over easily those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work i mean really work well too not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas but otherwise they are the bomb whee i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects i was really surprised to see how well they sounded i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route if you just want to play around a little this uke will do this is a very versatile tuner i use it all the time to check my instruments and keep things sounding good highly recommend this product this stand holds up my ukulele so yay folded up it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the hola gig bag which i also use and heartily recommend make no mistake this stand is not pretty it feels and looks like cheap plastic but it does the job
882	very very useful like seriously unless you are very very good you can quickly get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear i used this tuner as i transitioned from playing rocksmith to playing in the real world my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings with this tuner it doesn t matter if it is electric or acoustic it gives a very very accurate reading my luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it they were only off by units in any given direction very happy and pleased with this one i purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter the item works fine it is not overly strong or stable but the prices was right perfect for re stringing your guitar very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings the price was right too this is a must have tool and isn t cheap like most of the plastic ones out there the nice thing about this one is it cuts off excess with ease just looks better trimmed neatly star product ok i ve owned of these danelectro amps for one they are cheap in price loud in output and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon recently i purchased this item on ebay for bluetooth audio music receiver v wireless stereo adapter for smart phonesnow i can connect to my tablets smartphones and computers and use this amp as a great external bluetooth speaker plus the battery life is great try to buy a bt speaker on amazon with this wattage that s cordless and works from battery power and you will spend well over the included battery is worthless and dies in about minutes i installed a mah rechargeable v battery ebay and it lasts forever plus i can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when i want for this price its hard to beat inexpensive and practical you don t have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this just about any angle will work needs little space another plus
883	i ve tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments i use electric guitar acoustic guitar mandolin violin and banjo this one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport it doesn t get in the way has rubber feet and padding and just works simply and effectively it s not flashy looking but then it s never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument or blends in because of its compact size and black color nothing else is as versatile and effective including the multi instrument stands the ones with other shapes of the support arms and other folding designs this is simply the ideal it works got on time i am happy the concept of this guitar stand is great and i thought it would be perfect for my two telecasters that is until i get the stands in place and put the guitars in them the stands have a very deep angle and from what i could tell the guitars were sitting about to degrees back it just looks silly like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand or are in a slow motion fall backwards it also ends up taking up way too much space as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes i ended up returning these stands but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version if you re looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case this is it for the price it has better padding than i expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps good deal for the price ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life my playing sucks sounds better with these strings bright and warm at the same time great tone easy on the fingers this guitar stand is as basic as you can get has padding where it needs it to protect guitar sets up in seconds provides good stability and displays guitar nicely perfect stand as long as you don t have others roomates kids pets etc who may bump it and knock it over cheap the best way to describe this stand it serves it s purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand adds a little sustain and they look sharp but not gaudy put them on my martin d epiphone aj sce and washburn travel series ro tr nice i use this with a behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music it was just what i needed to give me clean sound running it through the usb not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like i was in a studio i highly recommend it great for beginners and experts the sound is great and is easy on the fingers i got them recommended by a friend yes dear reader this stand will work as a good support stand for not only my grand concert size acoustic guitar for my five string banjo with resonator and also for my baritone ukulele the stand is sturdy provides good support and looks good i am pleased with my purchase and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container i think these are great for the price they give you john mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so i am sticking with these just barely gets the job done i have a fender jazz bass standard the shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing it is very low quality not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly its just good enough but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open i would be constantly worried about it falling over i will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future this capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar it does not break and is very sturdy highly recommended not the best but not the worse this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar all the surfaces that make contact with your instrument are covered with rubber padding which is important only downside is there s no neck support i used this mainly for putting my guitar down when not playing not for displaying assembled the stand in seconds it is very stable and solidly constructed should last a life time very very good value try to get the version w the black cabinet for around as that s what most major music stores are charging in any case i was really looking more for a twin speaker to pair with an amp head but those can cost as much if not more than this combo the clean side of the amp is exactly that very very clean this amp has tons of power to spare in your house you do not have or want to turn it up beyond can t even imagine what the or might be like i have my own separate effects stomp box so i can let this amp sound like almost anything the big plus here is that unlike with real tube amps that need to be cranked up pretty much to get the right sound here you can have it set on and still get pretty much any amp sound i am using a zoom ms g all in all hard to beat for practice session as well as small to mid size gigs only thing i miss a bit is a headphone jack
884	i received a mim stratocaster as a gift a year ago recently i noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp after tracing the issue i discovered there was some play in the strat s jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip a quick fix was to bend the jack s connector end but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open making a minor gap where there wasn t that positive connection i ve purchased several switchcraft jacks and they just work stronger more flexible metal easy soldering good materials it s a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection obviously because the finish is chromed oxidation can get in the way of the connection but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied if oxidation wear is an issue switchcraft makes gold plated jacks however i just love these jacks and for the price they really can t be beat great product with a little soldering knowledge really basic in fact you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all nice and snug with my american stage cables d addario is great hey r ford uses them great price too much less than what my local music shop asks for these bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am re doing i ve learned the hard way that there are some things you don t skimp on and this is one switchcraft is what we used in the air force years ago and are still some of the best made electronic components out there i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas i had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger i took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards not forwards by hand slowly until it was perfect i also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case i slipped took me about hours the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance really close but they were terrible in operation i have no problems spending the on these to improve the guitar haven t played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes update played for a couple hours first thing i notice is that they are geared lower than the old chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment this fixed the chibson tuning issue i ll order another set for my other chibson also i have two epiphones i believe these are nicer than the epi s so i bought based solely on the reviews here i wasn t disappointed in fact i am pretty impressed good replacement for iffy tuners they worked for me
885	this is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight i don t have a bass however it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar if you enjoy playing guitars then i think you will love this shubb s acoustic guitar deluxe capo it something nice to have around your house and work great thanks to all
886	it is more than i hoped for very nice protection for my luna it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat these picks seem well made and have a solid feel but i m not sure i like the sound of them like so many other guitarists i go through a lot of picks searching for what feels and sounds the best for what i do i don t this is it for me at least not on acoustic whatever i didn t like about them got drowned out when i tried electric since i ve been playing more acoustic lately i might or might not buy these again like all gibson products this is high quality polish that one would use on a high quality guitar i have used gibson polishes for years this is a great item and works as reported it seemed to be in my fretting hands way a little but its ok this is a great tuner high quality construction the tuning is accurate the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
887	i have other capos and decided to try this one and i have to say i love it i have used the kyser spelling for years as my favorite and that is a good capo but i will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz i will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up but i love it so far i use it on my taylor ce taylor e and my epiphone anniv accoustic i bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful out of tune twang with my previous planet waves capo when i would try to reset the capo on a different fret planet waves capos are awesome don t get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully i bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and i love it i use the pedal as a preamp going into a pa or poweramp the pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind i use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite it is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar i have a vfe alpha dog and an mxr custom badass od before the pedal after the pedal i use an mxr phase and flanger vfe blueprint delay and then a byang triverb when all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when i am not going through a more traditional amp rig buy the pedal it s great good spring action made pretty solid no buzzing on the strings when i put it on the lifetime warranty is what i am stoked about i will probably buy two more for my other guitars highly recommend it i always have problem finding pick when i need them and this product helps me solve the issue it is easy to use
888	i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program i was excited to receive them as i ve looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and professional grade designation i m not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices any brand that works well at the right price i ll buy it that being said i ve recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones with thebose ae w bluetooth headphones blackbeing the most recent obviously the bose beat the tascam ones so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that sound wise you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range these tascam th r professional grade headphones don t sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges bass is great but even when tweaking the equalizer settings i never could find the clarity i was seeking in the full range i listened to several genres classical blues pop rock electronic country and latino with these headphones each time the quality was good but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iphone pc andyamaha rx v channel network d av receiver with airplay black the fit of the headphones is big for me usually they are too small having them as small as i could make them top of my head to ears the cups still dropped down a bit lower than i liked i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit the padding underneath the headpiece is minimal and after about minutes of use the top of my head hurt the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated the screw on adapter mm to mm allows for use with multiple devices stereo components and sound boards the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass great for those who want the chunky headset look are on the go djing and or have larger heads they are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening they re also not for those with smaller heads i have a fully weighted key alesis qs and an m audio axiom semi weighted and they re both fine when i m just playing standalone or recording audio or midi but i wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing per se the alesis is perfect i can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard correctly if that makes sense it makes a clear difference to me i opted for the key strictly for space considerations and while the down up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use i often wish i d gone for a larger model to get wider voicings i may trade it in for an upgrade at some point but overall i m very happy with the keyboard
889	i was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on the only issue i have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune red bar but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat so for me it is a quick check while i am in between songs anything with bars or more will get more attention planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff all of the cables in my pedalboard are planet waves i had just purchased a polytune about months to year ago and was a little annoyed when i saw ads for the polytune mine was still brand new to me and worked really well but after reading and watching about the improvements in this update i decided to take the hit sell mine for a loss of and get the new one a great choice this polytune is amazing bright accurate strobe option well built did i say bright improved foot switch it s just another example of tc hitting it out of the park yet again highly recommend getting one of these you know unless you want to grab a st gen for a deal i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner the reason why is the led lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage the pitch black is nice and bold and bright one reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time so its a give and take issue
890	first off this is a overdrive pedal with a mosfet circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion the pedal is very good at this there are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp this is on par with the warm tone of another ehx pedal the big muff fuzz the tone function is kindof useless to me i like to keep it on with the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh don t let that keep you from checking this hot rod out i love mine its a keeper fantastic just love this little amp at first thought it was broken but batteries were not sitting in right very happy it s ok tone is subjective and stars means it just ok to me it does need a hot signal going in to sound good so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static the eq switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so i always have the tone in the circuit i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal i am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me it is made well for the money i am not mad i tried it tried several of pedaltrain in the past pt too bulky and pt jr a little to small this one holds my pedals perfectly simple light i love it
891	i bought five of these when they were being blown out for like apiece but even at the normal price they are a bargain they are comfortable when used for an extended period of time even with a heavy les paul if you play an sg these will help counter the dreaded neck dive that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars incidentally amazon is selling these straps at about the price you would pay at gc highly recommended best articulate bass string for the money i have one of the first versions of the fender precision lyte bass from the s i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued they sound great and stay in tune sound like rotosounds think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick i am not a slap style player so i can t comment on that i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible try them you ll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs you can jam for hours with this thing it s awesome i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control when i got it i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal as far as a cv controler it sucks at that too why it squeaks as you move it after minutes use right out of the box behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name although only conceived in germany it s a direct copy of the yamaha fc and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares i m betting the extra dollars will be well worth it also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a wah effect at low volume in the studio good luck if you buy it
892	i ve been swapping back and forth between evans and remo for a while but after really liking the emad kick head i decided to lean more toward evans just for consistency in my setup i consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest compatible drumhead to what i really liked from remo on the evans line and i was led to the g series from remo s emperor series both being plies of mm free floating film honestly i think i m going to stick with evans from now on though i ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the level sizing and i wanted to give them a try my fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that i got was new enough to be l sized i got them on and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy i use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process but it went smoothly not sure if it was the placebo effect but i seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well deeper but just as resonant as an kick the coating seems to hold up better on the evans heads as well remo tends to flatten out within a few hours of play where the evans not only lasts longer but has a more finished feel to them i really wanted to like these but they re a frickin lint catching sticky frickin mess they went from my wife s snare back into the holder in a new york minute have never seen the light of day and may have been thrown in the garbage save your money we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now
893	it is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor as long as the guitar is on it works great if an initially unfavorable opinion changes i owe it to the maker to say so so i m saying so for me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used it s not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down in many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved as far as the sn is concerned wrong i ve found the sn to in fact be super tight but one has to insure that there isn t even a hint of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar this is what i don t like about the other type of snark display it s not symmetric it requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit if the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat when i m on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish in that regard the image shown here is wrong it shows the super tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with green and even a yellow uhm no the sn is super tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semi tones if that s what floats your boat and as they say on tv all for an incredibly low price i keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case at this price i already have a half dozen super tights with two more on the way the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn t cut it i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display i m quite disappointed and it sits here with no use it is cheap though still to me it was money out the window these tuners including the red version are the best i have many tuners from expensive peterson and boss korg seiko quiktune and many other brands from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons the snark is the easiest and most stable to use even my young guitar students who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that i love have no problem tuning with this tuner the only reason i give this instead of stars is that i ve noticed it s response is a little less than the original bulky snark sn i must admit i haven t checked out a new battery as with my original snark a new battery made a big difference but the size is something that cannot be beat the original snark is a little ungainly and this tuner really fits beautifully on my strat i have a boss tu stompbox tuner and am thinking of freeing up my pedal board real estate and using this instead overall this is a definite buy
894	i use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars except for the smaller takamine new yorker and a l ami i use the d addario custom lights i have grown a fondness for the phosphor bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking also the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys i ve tried such as martins and elixirs these strings are quite durable and long lasting in the years i ve been playing i ve never had these strings break on me i ve broken martin and elixir strings in the past the color coded end balls help with the restringing i typically get the three pack so i can restring a trio set of my herd at a time i really can t complain about anything the individual gauges are w w w whighly recommended this capo seems to handle quite nicely spring loaded trigger like a kyser still my personal fave but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring in time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune the only issue if you could call it that was that i have always used the kyser s that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one after many years of playing muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly usb condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing podcasts and for portability the reason being is that they are condensers for one and the other is that this mic has a built in interface an interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and analogue to digital and digital to analogue ad da converters of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer way way better so this mxl studio usb even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential so instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one mxl studio usb all you need is a laptop with a usb input and you there are limitations though with a usb mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your daw recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks the really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money so for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal quick easy and affordable one of the problems with using it in pro tools or any daw is that you can only use one interface at a time since the mic has a built in interface you can t use any other even in garage band for mac although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously so in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a usb mic is not what you need i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio i have the mxl v m which was their early offering but is no longer made and i have found the mxl v to be comparable to that one some other mxl s like the are muddy in the bottom end when bottom fishing for a good decent condenser mic some of the cad offerings are also top sellers when using the mxl usb in win no driver download is necessary if your mic comes without the included cd you can download the free mxl studio control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold there are also output adjustments as well one other thing that is unique about usb mics working with your pc is that they are dependent of course on your pc so i had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when i couldn t get the output from my pc or into the free reaper daw recording software free day trial also downloadable from mxl so i finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in windows accessible via control panel and then sound and then type troubleshooter into the search box in the upper right corner the answer was that my mic input volume inside of windows was down to zero i moved the slider up and bang it worked so for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into it s a mini jack like you have on your computer so with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod casting or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels this mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic i completely agree with jpfromoh this planet waves d addario artist capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly the micro adjusting knob for tweaking tension pressure is nice but i ve wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar ukulele that i have a standard tension spring might be a bit too firm but at least it s consistent i also thought i d like the curved cradle for the neck but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele i know i know this isn t designed for ukuleles but i have no such troubles with my kyser capos i don t understand the clip for a tuner on this thing i have several clip on tuners that clip directly to the headstock and most are planet waves already why would i want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when i m using the capo i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition and the pick holder is a nice touch but i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me as others have noted there are other better capos out there i love this company d addario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time ever since i switched to this brand of strings they seem to last longer and make a grab tone i don t know if it s my guitar taylor ce or the strings but i can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar the tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo i ve ever used and i ve tried many over the years but what was ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem including the pick clip and tuner holder protude outward away from the fingerboard it s awkward to apply and remove quickly it s visually distracting for player and audience and it doesn t add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment the only possible justification i can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck but even that doesn t fly regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and unless you re avoiding playing that first fret or use a low thumb classical fret hand position you re always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand i own the older planet waves tri action capo and never felt that to be a problem otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb the surface is arched probably between a radius that works fine on various strat fingerboards as well as a flatter sg lp style it doesn t work as well on the very flat radius of my martin om which is virtually the same as a classical if i cranked the tension it s possible the rubber would flatten out but i wouldn t risk marring the neck wood i tried both the pick and tuner clips and they re functional but to be honest i wouldn t use either too distracting and i only use tuners to get an initial a then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments depending on what they are the only other capo i ve ever used that protudes outward is the kyser with its notorious wrought iron fence design i have one and as good as the holding action is i ve never felt comfortable with the design the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference to top off the confusion the picture on the front of the cardboard card the ns artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that s impossible with this capo i have another headstock tuner that i ve had for awhile this planet waves pw is about the half the size and works just as well the clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky but the tuner works like a champ nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions compared to my other tuner it s rigt on the money the other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room i don t have to take the tuner off i am a fan of planet waves ns capos but this new one is not very well designed the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards i find my left hand hitting the lever when i m in open position frustrating it does have a pick holder which can be handy and a place to put an ns tuner which can also be handy i just think it could have been better designed i don t particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff i ll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser this is one of the nicer capo s ive used certainly superior to the old school band based jobs from yesteryear one of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab position release and go heck you could probably place it mid song if you were so inclined to do so also it clamps without bending the strings i ve used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints i hardly ever use a capo but if i need one i am glad to have this one i ve used a variety of tuners when the snark first came out the price was so low i thought it must not be that good however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several what i like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display is seems to be very accurate the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners about the only thing that has been an issue is that on occation it won t register turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem also it may be a litle larger than some like the planet waves d addario artist capo seems like a classic case of trying to do everything and not quite getting it right as a result the capo has a micro adjusting knob but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars such as my seagull that have non standard width fretboards the built in pick holder is useful but planet waves offers another less artist model that also has one in fact the other planet waves capo i have is much more amenable to different width necks than this one the artist capo also has an adapter that allows the player to attach one of those small clip on tuners directly too the capo assuming that you don t use the capo constantly why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitar s headstock check out other offerings from planet waves you can do better for less than with this one like many modern capos this has an unwieldy look to it that i don t like but once i get past that this is a top notch capo that is as good as it gets for capos i play several very different stringed instruments guitar mandolin octave mandolin tenor banjo and irish bouzouki and i like having a capo that i can use on all of them this is ideally suited for guitar but holds its own on all the other instruments i particularly like that there s nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way i can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck i really like that fact that it s adjustable and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin i also really like themeideal mcapo bronze guitar banjo mandolin capoas my all purpose capo and i own several of these because they re inexpensive and just a great product but this is definitely my new guitar capo and will replace the meideal in my case great product solidly built and it s a bonus that you can add the micro tuner to the bottom of it the construction appears to be very solid and the finish is a flat black baked on paint or so it appears might be some sort of powder coating as well the top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber and the spring seems very strong with great tension as noted it will accept a d addario micro tuner on the bottom and includes the bracket for mounting it i ve been using slinky regular nickels for over years on my electrics and love them i ve tried various coated strings etc but always come back to ernie for sound and value but on my acoustics it s been d addario j s since day one and still is never had one bad set out of over a hundred i adore the sound and the reliability so why have i never tried their e git strings because the slinkys are perfect but i must say so are these i just put a set of s on one of my strats and they are as snappy yet not too bright as i could want they really complement the single coil tones especially the and out of phase positions so if you re a strat fan and love that tone give these a shot one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact no idea why but if you have huge posts and like mega wraps here s your puppy i only do a triple wrap max so it s just more to cut but hardly an issue and no matter what the coated string fans say those might stay clean longer but that brand new string zing only lasts a few hours on any string coated or not so if you re recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones or playing big gigs where tone is everything i say stick with uncoated strings and aside from slinkys these are the best i ve played this is the best capo we have out of three we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one pros easy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tune easy to put on the guitar although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they don t buzz it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fret nice pick holder feature the micro adjuster is easy to adjust it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring cons none this is the capo to get the capo is pretty good i like the ability to customize tension however it is unclear which way the capo should be put on with the pincer side facing the floor or facing the ceiling in either direction it s a bit awkward to put on take off as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly the kaiser is still the best imo but you can t adjust the tension on those overall this is good but not great the d addario exl bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great i ve been a long time fan of d addario strings and these strings did not disappoint they were very easy to string my fender strat with and stayed in tune a good long time the strings had a good feel to them as well where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords you know how you have tuned your guitar and it s tuned as well as it s going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesn t sound right you check the tuning and it s tuned alright but why isn t it sounding right these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords bar chords were terrific too impressive i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat
895	oh quick note this capo is meant for instruments with radiused not flat necks that said it works fine on a non radiused ukulele i ve been using only kyser capos for many years now they don t fall off they don t usually pull strings sharp but they do grip tight and can damage some finishes this capo is easy on easy off with the pistol grip has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won t damage finishes and has adjustable tension i backed off the tension as much as possible set it on the neck made one adjustment and it was perfect since i can adjust the tension i have no worries about it pulling strings sharp i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths the flashback x is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under new a steal in my opinion having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly the toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website it s simple to use my galaxy to beam the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups very cool technology makes me feel like i m on a guitar version of star trek i can t say that i have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great i am partial to the with modulation very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus the space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background which coincides with the delay time sounds great with a little overdrive added in all in all this is a great pedal and a purchase that i am totally happy with it is by far the best delay pedal i have ever owned as well as being the most versatile five stars from me we geetarists are a funny bunch we ll change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long and spend a fortune doing it but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks case in point pure nickel strings time was when that was all there was and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled coincidence nope these things just sound better if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds if you re used to wrapped strings and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general especially if you use tubes tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs they just fit i m not nuts about fender acoustic strings but i like their normal electric strings fine though ernie ball slinkies have been my go tos for many years but these fender pure nickels are very very nice and at they re a real deal most pure nickels run nearer to ten and these sound pretty much the same and i don t seem to break many of em neither if you re used to mixed alloy pure nickels might seem a little dull but wait a bit and you ll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips try a set and see what i mean it s subtle but it s beautiful but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume i turned my modded hot rod deluxe up to call the cops levels the neighbors are getting used to it by now louder than the drummer by a good chunk and i got less squealing warmer tone by far and full chords triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string i ve ever used i think there s an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime check out bb s tone on the legendary live at the regal to hear what i mean that s the stuff so if you haven t tried pure nickels spend a buck or two more or maybe less than you normally do and give these bargain priced nickels a try you might find that you re a convert within seconds i know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up those zep and jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel and digging into some otis rush or billy gibbons licks is like night and day the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels hell of a bargain at less than five bucks this will work with my daughter s ipod touch generation however the garage band app is for ios and hers is an ios and will not update to so though she can t use garage band there are others that are supposed to work she downloaded the ampkit app and it works great

greater voice memosxewton music studio it s a pretty cool idea but the cords are a nuisance most electric guitar players like to stand while playing and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections i was surprised at how small the jam is slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around and it saves on other s ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings especially if you are beginner guitarist overall pretty good and very simple to operate just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice my daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do maybe it s because i cut my musical teeth on motown and s rock but i ve always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound or even ground wound strings it might also have something to do with the fact i play upright as well flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright like to my ears it doesn t hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever too i use d daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as i ve found them to be very consistent from set to set and the sealed plastic packaging means that i can buy a set today put it in my case and it s be as good as new a year later i used to use labella flats on my fretless and then switched to thomastik jazz flats then a friend told me he d switched from the thomastiks to these he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well i m now a convert too
896	these may be my new favorite bass strings likes bright i d call them very bright except they don t seem to have the harsh twangy tone i d expect they seem bright yet still soft clear the lows sound present and clear consistent flex once i had these on for a couple of days the tuning seemed very stable the tone seems to sharpen less when they are played hard compared to my last strings d addario brand to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings playability these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with price i feel like i should be paying more for these strings technology new design textured round this is a round wound string with a hex shaped core overall love these especially for the price i m mainly a guitarist but i do play bass from time to time on an old fender american these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound i love the tone you get out of these very bluesy and the punch isn t too rough it s just right i m a huge fan of d addario been using their strings for at least years and they never disappoint give these a try if you re looking for some new strings the dp ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp digital portastudio i have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the dp ex on its own terms pointing out features and issues important to me mostly workflow related as someone who grew up home recording with analog equipment if you want all the details of the full functionality i d recommend downloading the manual from tascam or a dealer site that offers it speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first there are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy or better yet downloading a second copy is a good idea this is picky but i found the larger size of the dp manual easier to read and handle than the smaller dp ex i ve used software based daws for years and while i enjoy midi recording mixing and editing with them basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when i used analog equipment i have a one room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and aside from pc noise i miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old mk ii cassette track instant power on press record pause ready set go granted i don t miss the wall of hiss that plagued those recordings but i had fun capturing a lot of musical moments using a hardware control surface with my daw didn t solve the problem i just find the reality of booting windows dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment especially when recording acoustic instruments i hoped the dp ex would provide some of that older experience with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup the bottom line for me is it does and it doesn t first some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions size wise the difference between porta and pocket studios is roughly x x inches versus x x inches tascam doesn t provide a case or cover for the dp ex but a larger ereader or tablet case should do fine and i d recommend one if you plan on portable use the plastic appears fairly durable but it s still plastic the knobs on the dp ex are smaller in diameter lower and have rounded tops compared to those on the dp however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip i also find the smaller circular pushbuttons on the dp ex don t protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar shaped buttons on the dp and are less comfortable to use the data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the dp ex which i prefer the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus you ll need the dedicated ps p v power supply for the dp ex the v ps l for the dp can t be shared the plug won t fit so you can t fry it and don t even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously on the other hand the teac rc f footswitch is sharable you ll need a mini plug to phone adaptor but i think it s indispensable if you re working alone speaking of power a strong plus for both recorders and for me a deal breaker were it not present is phantom mic power so you re not limited to the built in stereo condensers they re not bad for rough work but unlike mic stand mounted portables it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals i can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar acoustic or electric amp violin or percussion i want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics i like the resistance of the faders on the dp but i can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the dp ex there s no cd burner either on the smaller unit but with usb transfer capability that s not an issue for me having similar xlr phono and rca jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste i m not bothered by it because i have space to run the cables but it s worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you the led screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues the flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be especially since the menu is used so much a slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble i do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at degrees and doesn t interfere with jack access it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use tascam should consider a similar accessory the software is largely the same for both units aside from additional mastering tools essentially packaged presets and here lies my major criticism i feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality i e levels eq arming tracks with dedicated knobs and buttons and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what i see is an inflexible constraining menu system if there were some way to customize the menu navigation the equivalent of software hot keys it s possible the frequent repetition of non functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do the best evidence of an unbalanced design i see is the dedicated phantom power button on both units whose purpose is to display the phantom screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off that crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder when space for knobs and buttons is severely limited i can understand the design thinking and trade offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu but the dp ex is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi tracker a fostex x effectively doubled up the functionality of two tracks to cover four so i have to question whether the trade offs tascam made here in fact diminish the user experience with connectivity and software based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving i believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the dp ex will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience i think tascam would be well served taking that into account i ve always liked the design of tascam gear it just looks and feels well made and that s still in large part true of the dp ex but i can t help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old mk ii cassette track would satisfy a lot of people out there and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off i love small amps and have played many of them over the last years i still own a few my favorite being the first super champ from the early s rivera nailed that one i naturally prefer tubes for that true tone but tried one of these out last year at a pal s place and was sold within two minutes i bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then i can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp i ve ever used for the money it s a crazy deal i have never once used the included online stuff or the ableton software so those add even more value to this package no doubt all i wanted was a warm up amp with real tone and this is that and plenty more my all time favorite tone is the clean glassy fender late s early s sound typified by the bassmans and twins and deluxes of the pre cbs era that tone needs tubes to really sing but to my amazement the amp modeling of this mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes you ll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there especially on the bassman settings my strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings and my prs absolutely smokes with real lease breaking volume on super sonic dial the gain way back for a nice low throttle roar having gain volume and master lets you dial in a ton of tones with each amp model and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus tremolo etc plus various reverbs delays etc though i find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by if i can t get the tone i want with my fingers then i need to learn how to is my motto and this amp is so accurate that i can above all this mustang is musical for a small amp that s a real feat but for clams it s a near miracle add a built in tuner the most useful extra any amp can have good effects great amp models the software and more online amp models which i ll get around to one day but so far i get all the tone i need from the amp as it is plus watts for lots of headroom and this is a straight up steal for a bill the only thing missing is serious bass at volume but this is an after all not a so you ll always miss some of the real bottom but what s there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy all told the mustang i is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now crate and line etc don t come close but paired with a mini strat this would be the absolutely perfect beginner s set up for a kid looking to play anything from the beatles to metallica and everything in between can t recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can t come in a small solid state amp it can it does and it s cheaper than i can still believe fender truly went to on this one leo would be proud a great set of bass strings with all the right features perfect balance of bright punch and warmth right deep tones great feel and playability stable tuning textured round design with hexagonal core shape durable easy to stringmy father uses d addario on his telecaster and acoustic guitars which originally prompted me to choose d addario for my fender jazz bass i can say that the brands reputation carries over to bass these are phenomenal strings i ve been using d addario xl nickel wounds on my p bass for a long time they have a lot of tone they seem to last a long time and they re not very expensive these strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds but are a lot brighter you get lots of overtones and high end from these the choice of gauges is a little different from the regular xls too instead of the a and the e they have a a and a e that s just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end and more metal to dig into while retaining low tension in the d and g i m more of an old school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound but if you re into funk or more modern sounds you may feel that the bright ss sound is for you and if so these are a great string i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics after stringing them up tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded i play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played they sounded great all up down the fret board where i really noticed the difference was in recording been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before except for the songs with acoustic bass i will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before i installed these strings i don t play slap or pick bass so i can t say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended i usually use gibson vintage nickle strings on my electric guitars but when i had an opportunity to try theses strings out i jumped at the chance i put them on a gibson les paul goldtop guitar with p pickups i had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed they had some great spank and sounded great easy to play they almost seemed thinner than advertised they play like s but sounded like tens i am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the gibson strings next i want to try a set on a strat and see how they sound i suspect they will sound and play great the adjustable tension is a great idea and the open close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and won t get in the way of your hands unlike the capo i had before this one it even comes with a handy pick holder i could make this review longer but what else do you really need to know if you have a non classical string guitar acoustic or electric this guy should do the trick regardless of neck shape its a very well designed capo
897	i m impressed with these exp guitar strings what i expecteda more dead sound than the non coated strings they replaced coated strings usually lack the bright high end brilliance that uncoated light strings have what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound when i put light strings on my acoustic i m going for easy playability and most of all a very bright and airy sound these deliver on both counts durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes so far they are holding their tone and brightness i will report back after three months my last set started to sound dull and exhibit more tone variation after six months when viewed with a very sensitive tuner it seems that my dirtier strings detune sharp a bit more on attack the harder you strum them this is confirmed by the fact that they just sound out of tune to me when they get dirty conclusioni will be ordering more of these i think they perform very well for the price love the bright light gauge sound and playability i ve been searching for the perfect capo for years now and this one s come the closest so far the capo s well made and doesn t show any manufacturing flaws at all as delivered the capo fits the neck of my taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension some other capos are horrible to attach and grip the neck so hard i m afraid it ll dent the fretboard the planet waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profile i like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around nothing s worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple it comes with a clip to hold a pick but it s kind of hard to slip one in especially with some picks i use overall i think this capo s a winner it s easy to put on and take off there s no buzzing and it stays out of my way when i m playing that s all i ask for when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it at first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and i figured the plastic would soon break i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either i have used this for a couple of months now switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well i may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner it works as well as my expensive model i was using and i don t have to stick it on the guitar body worth checking out usb condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing podcasts and for portability the reason being is that they are condensers for one and the other is that this mic has a built in interface an interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and analogue to digital and digital to analogue ad da converters of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer way way better so this mxl studio usb even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential so instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one mxl studio usb all you need is a laptop with a usb input and you there are limitations though with a usb mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your daw recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks the really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money so for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal quick easy and affordable one of the problems with using it in pro tools or any daw is that you can only use one interface at a time since the mic has a built in interface you can t use any other even in garage band for mac although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously so in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a usb mic is not what you need i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio i have the mxl v m which was their early offering but is no longer made and i have found the mxl v to be comparable to that one some other mxl s like the are muddy in the bottom end when bottom fishing for a good decent condenser mic some of the cad offerings are also top sellers when using the mxl usb in win no driver download is necessary if your mic comes without the included cd you can download the free mxl studio control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold there are also output adjustments as well one other thing that is unique about usb mics working with your pc is that they are dependent of course on your pc so i had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when i couldn t get the output from my pc or into the free reaper daw recording software free day trial also downloadable from mxl so i finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in windows accessible via control panel and then sound and then type troubleshooter into the search box in the upper right corner the answer was that my mic input volume inside of windows was down to zero i moved the slider up and bang it worked so for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into it s a mini jack like you have on your computer so with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod casting or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels this mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic i just picked up a pod hd and i love it of course a couple days later they announced the hd x but it doesn t look like they ve made any major changes anyway if you re thinking of getting one here are my thoughts in no particular order this thing is versatile you can use it in a number of different ways just as an effects board with customized effects with effects and amp sims as a midi controller and as a recording interface to name a few line gave you access to the guts everything is tweakable assignable and flexible they trust their users to read the freaking manual i m amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay no problemo for live performance this thing would be perfect it allows you to organize your presets in set lists and name everything whatever you want you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves while not all the effects are my cup of tea in particular some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear there are enough options to make anyone happy for example i love the distortion i get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects fantastic it s built like a tank metal exterior everything feels solid and like it will last longer than i willif you ve got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance take a look at these and the new x version just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates not to mention the amps would cost you more money assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones truly a great piece of gear at about twice the price of their standard strings these d addario nyxl strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability higher breaking point and something called fusion twist which i swear is a rare chubby checker b side having just put a set of these on one of my guitars i can t speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings but i can say they are solid dependable strings with lots of punch and crunch knowing nothing about guitars except that my husband plays one i got this for my other half he was very happy with it said it was an excellent quality capo only needing a turn of knob to do what it needs to do he showed me how it worked how it gives a different sound to the guitar depending on where you position it i would highly recommend this to you guitar players my husband is pretty picky about his guitar stuff and i can assure you he was very satisfied with this capo highly recommended capos are not something that i shop for i have had two for years one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type it is similar to this one yeah in looks only this one blows that one away it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways this is great i play a tele and an acoustic martin it works great on both i play professionaly and this is the best thing i ve gotten in two years taylor ships this guitar with these strings and for a good reason they sound wonderful right out of the box like with most all string guitars lights or extra lights are most often appropriate the feel of these nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate in tandum with the instrument bring out it s best resonance and sustainability give em a try i ordered these because i wanted to deck the tremolo on my strats because i don t really use the trem i have a modern american standard and an american vintage reissue hot rod strat there are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as i can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black my standard now has black and silver springs but the hot rod has of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with easy to install and works like a charm i ve used d addario strings for years and they never fail me these extra light are great for playing lead as they re easy to bend and feel great on your fingers as they are extra light strings they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear for a brand as a whole i d recommend d addario strings to any guitarist and for gauge it s really dependent on play style and role if you are in a group i love these customs inbetween the lights and mediums you get the bright booming sound nice bends and of course the longer playing life i ve used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in them to brigthen the sound a tad i would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye i have used d addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel playability tone and reliability this set is no exception light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone highly recommend anything by d addario for a long time i never thought much about guitar strings i pretty much thought they were all the same in fact guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days d addario has gotten into the act with these nyxl strings and i have to say that they are not like any other strings i ve used the feel is different and the sound is different different in a wow way yeah they re more expensive but they re worth it i m a cheapskate and i can t go back to cheap strings now i m spoiled and i ve become a guitar strings snob my wife myself are a celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed we considered a wireless to use with a battery powered crate taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet at these events no power is available when i saw this at the price offered and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered i thought it was worth a try in the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn t hear the stories in the songs we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost it kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood the result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show laughing at the comedy crying at the tragedy our tips cd sales have gone way up is it high fidelity quite simply no but in our case it works beautifully recommended just remember the price point and you won t be disappointed i have to admit this up front i m a terrible bass player i play guitar and keep a bass in the music room for times when i have friend over to jam i do dabble with the bass but i m not proficient with it that being said i really appreciate the difference these strings make in sound playability and durability these strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time they have punch and snap which are good things to have in a bass i haven t had them on for a real long time but in the time i ve had them they remain consistent and show absolutely no sound or metal degradation in the time they ve been on my fender mim jazz bass when i need another set i ll buy these according to the ad copy this pedal replicates full stack marshall crunch as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that what i m loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up its responsive to your picking attack its distortion is very very harmonically rich and it does give you a marshall type sound good boost in the mids and bass giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for sad to say it actually does the full stack thing better than my proco rat which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal the rat is fantastic and i have no plans to sell mine don t get me wrong but the crunch distortion can get the raging full stack tones the rat can but has a tighter bottom end less noise and a more open sound than the rat individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion its a great pedal period its a darn guitar miracle at as a side point i play lots of ramones stuff and this pedal more than any other gives me that awesome johnny ramone tone i was running my gold top with p s into this pedal then into the sparkling clean twin reverb setting on my fender mustang ii this pedal plays well with modeling amps which is a rarity let me tell you and with some tweaking i was getting a fantastic ramones tone better than i ve ever got with my rat my boss ds ds hm anything else i ve owned and i ve owned over dozen other dirt boxes over the years this is the pedal that finally did it it just nails that cranked s marshall stack sound my hat s off to joyo they made a fantastic distortion one of the very best i ve ever played and they re practically giving it away buy one you ll use it you ll love it you ll be happy you bought it i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass as with any guitar the factory strings left much to be desired with fretted basses i d always liked strings with a little brassiness but round wounds just didn t feel or sound right on a fretless small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction and round wounds just didn t have that acoustic sound there were quite a few choices for fretless strings but i ve always liked d addarios on my string guitars these flat wounds were a perfect choice they ve got plenty of bottom but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings the bass sounds more like a real bass and the action is now so smooth i can use a small vibrato when i like no longer restricted to the wide jaco style there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds but there s something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound as soon as i put these on i felt like i was home don t get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable there s a little more brightness to the output they are a little more long lasting and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal xl this is a good string but it looks like the going rate on these strings will be bucks a set i can get three sets of regular excellent xl strings for that money and if the nyxl lasted times as long then they d be worthwhile but i ve been able to try them twice now and they don t last times as long great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced these have a nice bright sound and are easy on the fingers with a light action pretty deluxe strings for the price here on amazon i have them on my travel acoustic six string martin and am happy especially since i am not a pro guitarist and my fingers can get sore i say get em
898	i m using these on the mandolin perfect for clear loud picking when i want a more gentle muted tone i use d andrea pro these are very tiny picks much much smaller than pictured i have very small hands so they work for me they are not slippery which helps i ordered this for my husband the musician he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel he would definitely purchase this product and he s pretty picky about his guitar strings i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price sounds good and the action is smooth i have reviewed these strings before and frankly i wasn t all that impressed with the tone the first time around i think they feel great on the fingertips and they re very playable especially for a picker but i just wasn t sold on the tone to be fair i only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars and found them lacking there seemed to be a drop ff in tone when switching from my usual strings martin sps to these so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar i have a yairi alvarez ay which is a sized guitar and they sound terrific i m no engineer or physicist so i really can t explain the mechanics of it all but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body and they produce a very clear bright tone across the higher range and hold their own on the low range i still don t think they re the best thing since sliced bread and i still think they re a bit overpriced but i have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than i would expect this seems to have no effect on the tone but for what these cost you d think the coating would last a lot longer than two months i play daily for at least minutes a day overall these are good but overpriced strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars you ll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them and which don t in my experience large body guitars lose tone but they sound great on a smaller body i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge strings in both phosphor bronze and bronze instead of writing a separate review for each i figured i d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f rc guitar it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce i have always heard that phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a rosewood guitar i would agree the tone is nicely balanced maybe a bit weak in the bass but the strings are new and in a couple days i expect them to sound a bit better the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone the nanoweb coating is nice it protects the strings from corrosion finger sweat really can do a job on strings without dulling the sound i think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original guild strings and it just plays easier the strings are mounted on a gibson hummingbird an iconic mahogany body spruce topped dreadnaught sized guitar again s are recommended for mahogany guitars as popular as the hummingbird is i was never totally pleased with the sound of it it is a great guitar to strum along with while singing but it almost sounded too muddied not enough articulation between the different strings the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play the strings are easier to play partially because of the coating partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity without going out of tune the bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes i am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the martin sps that were on it prior to the switch elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings in the end you won t spend more money on what i think are far superior strings i was looking forward to trying these as i ve loved this company s product since day one but i think they ve messed around with the gauge slapped a meaningless hd tag on and added a few bucks to the price more profit in someone s pocket for marketing jargon i have a smaller bodied guitar so these should have by their claim given me better balance but imho the opposite happened the bottom dropped out the top end stopped sizzling and the middle strings totally took over when i strum with a pick when i play with fingers it s better but not worth spending more money on than the normal s i ve been using which i think i liked a lot better it s possible that these work great on the taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for color me skeptical but i d say if you re happy with what you have you need not try these again long time user and big fan but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly hd moniker no thanks
899	just put these on my martin dcx e and they sound great this is a big guitar that really rings out and the elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone playing rhythm guitar flat picking and fingerpicking i can t say if they last longer vine has us review this asap after daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning i have used elixir nano web strings before and i do think they keep their tone a bit longer that being said my go to strings are still d addario i m certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product so they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past highly recommended nice bright light i have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about years as with many things i m a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music this light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything the switch is conveniently located on top of the light the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move unlike my twin lights my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand it comes with a cord that has a standard inch end i plugged it into a small guitar amp they use it mainly to sing along with their cds mp s note that this is not really a mic i would use in my studio it is more of a toy to be honest but a quality toy for a young child in that regard i give it five stars i m a d addario man myself but hey free is free so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out thus far they have proven durable both in terms of playability and longevity of tone so many other variables to consider when rating strings such as the guitar they go on the gauge of string being used the playing style and climate of the end user etc these are a solid performing string set though i am unlikely to switch allegiances from d addario any time soon still there is no reason to fear trying these elixir s out ok i like this one a lot it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime it is accurate easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing it sure beats the other units i have used where you clamp on some weird thing tune up and then stash back in your gig bag this one is bing on tune and back to playing it weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up i hesitate to write this review simply because it s pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling i do think they re the best playing strings i ve used when it comes to pure playability hands down none better they were butter smooth and great for flat picking but for me it was a trade off because i simply wasn t impressed with the tone i even took the time to try them on three different guitars all dreadnoughts a classic maple sides spruce top a mahogany back sides with spruce top and a maple backs sides with a nato top on all three i didn t like the tone as much as the strings i was using i really wanted to like them but they simply didn t have the tone of the medium gauge martin sps i normally use this isn t to say they re not great strings that sound different on other peoples guitars but i simply didn t like them on mine i love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music i play in our jam group the elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the martin strings i use and the treble sounds tinny vs the clear ring of the martins i normally use to be fair the bass strings sound great and aren t much different i would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you re going to use them i play in acoustic groups and the elixir strings just don t have what i need to be heard in spite of how great they feel under your fingers if playability is more important than great tonal range then by all means buy these strings you won t be disappointed i m guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones this is one of the best tuner i have had what a great value for a low cost thank to all for selling this guitar tuner at amazon i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isn t one of them but after seeing so many great uke players lately jake shimaukuro joe brown i had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself i wanted a playable instrument and i didn t feel like spending a lot of money i ve tried ukes in stores that were big disappointments bad intonation no tone etc after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase result this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks sure it doesn t have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top but it delivers good tone excellent intonation and good playability at a very good price it may not be a star intrument but it s a star value if you re thinking about trying ukulele but you re not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away i would strongly recommend an lu even after you buy a better uke this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests so that you can play ukulele duets i have tried coated strings in the past including elixirs and have never been very fond of them whenever i tried them i felt a certain disconnect from my guitar somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom not that i hated them just didn t really love them these are the best ones i ve tried so far i still don t like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs i mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off if you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there after a dozen or so gigs with them they still sound the same as when i put them on this is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board i like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking i find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle i don t use it much with single coils since they don t seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone built solid a quality pedal that should hold up well these strings are really quite good but i wouldn t call them perfect the unwound strings are not quite as bright as i am accustomed to but they still ring nicely this is the only complaint i have about these strings if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be star strings as it stands i give them stars not a big knock actually the low end on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm i put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the jumbo aspect of my acoustic the sound is very big full and nice definitely a recommended product stars
