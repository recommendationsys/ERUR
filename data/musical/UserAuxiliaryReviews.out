0	bought this cover to go with behringer mic it does what it s designed to do it was a little hard getting it onto the head of the mic but at least that way i know it s not going to be falling off during a performance or a recording session economical way to keep spit out of mic they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic i am not sure how they would feel on a heavy electric it s solid built maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise manufacture said it s for practice to me it serves the purpose i bought this cable because my guitar connection is in the back this just fix perfectly i don t expected nothing better this is just right glad i chose to purchase this cable this bag is made well enough if you are careful it offers good protection you can t rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly can t stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc if your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag otherwise it s a good bag especially at this price this is a great product very light very sturdy and at a low price well worth the investment
1	i like ernie ball strings they are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands i tried i change strings every two weeks i tried the rest and returned to the best in years i have had every kind of capo out there this is the right one this one works buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case they are well made and inexpensive enough i bought them at dollars use for small music gigs and dj mc uses they are great for dj uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn t so important as long as you can be heard and understood i recommend for use of small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practices rehearses etc for higher quality microphones at a reasonable price look at the audix om when it s around bucks or audio technica products i ve had this amp about a week now and i m still finding cool things about it the first thing i did was went through all the presets i didn t like the clean channel it wasn t really clean but i quickly found out how to set it like i wanted it press the clean button then turn all the preset effects to and then hold down on the clean button about three seconds until the lights blink and now it s really clean you can also do this with all the other channels too just set every thing like you want it and hold down the button on the channel you want and there it is and don t worry you can always reset it back to factory settings and start over it s a small amp but it s bigger than i thought it would be but the sound that comes out of that speaker is big i have been playing for about years and i know i could use this amp in a small club without running it into the pa if you do need a little more volume it has a line out so you can run it to the pa and have all the volume you want i would buy this amp again if mine was stolen makes a great practice room amp you can take it without all your pedals and still have all the effects you would need for the price it s a bargain works as advertised but the keys are stiff pads take too much presure to activate nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop after the first few uses the usb socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed i had registered it with akai already so i complained to them and they sent me a new one i had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product not recommending this product i was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time good though they were too expensive foronly one effect at a time returned it
2	i am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up dial it in and play it for a while i edited yet again as someone didn t appreciate my gloating over other guitars i own sorry to offend you i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this but in all fairness i received my gibson les paul on the same day buying it from my local music store and professionally set up ready to go i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak but now even after comparing them to each other they really aren t that far apart the gibson is the best guitar i ve ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it but this little baby is now my second favorite my other review was not fair i paid a lot more for the gibson and bucks for this epiphone dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal wow i must honestly admit the edge goes to my gibson but not by as much as you d think this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price if i were to play them each blindfolded i would never guess one was guitar ever the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul it s easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound i can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock to be honest i will probably play this epiphone a lot more than the gibson after all if i ding this one up i haven t broke the bank i think i ll tend to use this one a lot more than the other i am very happy with this epiphone les paul and will proudly play and own it i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge i may purchase another one and put it away as i m sure the price won t stay this low plus i ll get another one in a different color you can never have too many guitars i am going to an a pickguard to this one the finish on it is outstanding and i d like to keep it that way if i were thinking of learning to play the guitar this one is a no brainer buy it if you re an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar i d buy this one is a heartbeat i was shocked at how sweet it sounds how good it looks how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is fantastic new rule for me no writing reviews until i own the product for at least one week come on now these are ernie ball strings what can i say that hasn t been said a time already there the best buy them this was a great purchase a bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them great price and purchase just what i needed the display is easy to read and easier to use my old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult the many colors of the snark makes tuning quick and easy a definate must for any guitar player my son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it great purchase
3	i ve owned the same one for years and it s still going strong after many gigs the spring tension is just right a strap is a strap what can you really say about it it was about with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine it s comfortable and fits my bass well i m a bigger guy and have plenty of length if i needed it nice value great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f perfectly solid and steardy case that will last a very long time one of the best stands in the industry fits any guitar banjo or even a cello good construction and easy to put together how can you beat that
4	purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my son s acoustic guitar he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings he says they last a lot longer and sound better too when i first learned guitar my buddies kept telling me i d want a capo but i held out until just recently the dunlop is secure doesn t scratch the guitar at all and holds the strings down as it should instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning i can use this to achieve the tone i want good item for the price very good string i ve been using elixir strings for about ten years now i ve been a full time musician for about years now and for what i do these sound the best and last for or more month s within these ten years i ve only had strings break on me and i sometimes work days a week for many for at a time i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy a must for guitarists
5	absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock s influences i would probably buy the phase today though as it has different positions to choose from i assume including the original set up as one of them well i need to correct this this review was for the old models the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain i will probably get an eh small stone now though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough if at all about the sound quality of their products the capitalists have become too greedy and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live god help us to be honest i m not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix one of the best names in the business and for the fact it was cheaper than most i m very pleased with the pedal and couldn t be happier i own all versions of this pedal and cherish them if you need more control with eq this pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket more versatile than the sovereign i bought this to daisy chain two small kustom powered pa cabinets virtually all of the xlr cables available were way too long for my application this cable filled the bill perfectly very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion but when i got it and played with it i figured out it was alot different that advertised it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal it s got an attitude but it soft at the same time it s truly a one of a kind product i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal make a note it is not a metal pedal not by any means actually but for what it is it is fantastic
6	podcasting on a bit of a budget setup i wanted good sound quality nice warm tones these mics deliver in a world where i didn t quite have the cash for condensers i wanted i needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word these sound great for under was fantastic i am glad i didn t break budget here i m using these with the behringer fx mixer i am so extremely happy with them colors help keep track of what is going into where and the build quality is solid i was warned about the shielding but i haven t experienced an issues yet this box is what i have been missing out of my setup always getting the question can i hook my keyboard into your sound board feel good to say that now i have the capability now
7	used these for years on son s electric guitars no fuss mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall no neck damage to axes mounts well but try to find a stud certainly keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall no complaints if you re going to drill your wall is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers all star reviews on this baby and i agree and i add to that total stars it is a good pedal it is not heavy and the price is good it is a good choice for a beginner thank you we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices sounds great looks great the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight even fixed another bands vox mic connector his sure cable was loose in the connector this cable was tight has worked on sm nady starpower akg s mxl marshall and mark bass amps and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the xlr s and on the numerous mixers and yes color rules i m not a big fan of pedals at all i much prefer multi effects but that being say this is a great cheap pedal does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack
8	i cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after i received the product the cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator the fretboard turned out nicely though so i decided to give it a instead of a i have to say though that i believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn t a bad buy just remember it isn t recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one even though i have a tuner in my pedalboard setup and one on my imac via mainstage the snark is indispensable it s perfect for those times when you don t want to drag out a bunch of gear and just want to noodle around even without an amp i use this little guy for electric guitars and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great the arms are adjustable so the instrument won t rest on the pegs the foam is good and the hardware is included plus the price is great i used this on my bass and i don t know what more you can say about it it works and does at it is supposed to i have no issues with quality or feel it s too loose
9	i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar got tired of losing picks in mid jam digging through pockets scavenging for another pick now it s right there i ve tried a few different straplock options and these are the best not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good highly recommend firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick they are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold i can play all night without dropping it not quite as loaded as the red all instrument snark but it gets the job done is very sensitive to vibration
10	i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open which oddly had staples holding it closed this little stand is great i am looking at it right now across the room holding my zager guitar it is light non obtrusive holds the guitar well and it is portable when mr guitar and i take a trip together i highly recommend it keeps that guitar off the bed floor table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one and it is not a toy don t be misled by the price this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics and while it may not be a marshall stack it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice to this end i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip then i just patch in my mike twiddle the controls and go to town the tone has been fairly pure although with a mike at least i can also get some pops crackles and squeals this is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp so the honey tone is not at fault in general this amp is pretty forgiving of the input i ve used it with a high impedance mike astatic jt a low impedance mike behringer xm and electric guitar fender stratocaster it handles these without noticeable signal loss what is this amp exactly my guess is that danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox added a watt amplifier circuit and put the whole shebang into a retro case the result is quite appealing and the overall look and feel is one of quality the case is solid albeit plastic the three controls volume tone and overdrive while not detented have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components the input inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid someone in danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit s leather strap though it is more decorative than useful if you can operate an overdrive stompbox then you know how to work this amp the volume control is obvious the tone control alters the bass treble mix but not very significantly in my opinion the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion again not to a great degree the instructions describe sounds but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor otherwise why label one setting send the cats under the bed ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you as i said this is small but really not a toy i ve personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it s so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable and when i decide that i m good enough to panhandle in penn station this baby is going with me just starting out again playing guitar and ordered up this classical from the moment i took it out of the box i was impressed the finish was really nice and the sound is awesome seems to stay in tune pretty well too for under you can t go wrong first off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless you have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response the keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable there is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs hate the mini usb jack since those connections rarely last for this price it is a do not recommend for me
11	i ve had this cable for awhile and i m not too impressed with the quality the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin i use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn t had much of a workout i don t think it would hold up long on stage at a venue i have been using dunlop picks for a long time good feel grip and not too heavy or thick good deal sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever usually i wouldn t notice a significant difference between brands except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears but when i put d addarios on my i just couldn t believe the improvement over the martins it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else i m glad the search is over for awhile and i have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here price is great works perfect comfortable and looks sharp not the least bit stiff like some leather products my first experience with levy and completely satisfied thank you wayne seem to work well keep the ground switch selected and it will do just fine i have used different direct boxes and i recommend this one
12	the name says it all fast fret fast fingers i played over live shows from min sets to hr sets just this year on national stages my strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat grime and dirt flying through the air this stuff honestly works very well it is part of my regular arsenal i was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive i don t hold it against the pedal though i have a marshall class and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive i get from the amp i say this as a compliment in my case however why would i want to replicate what i already have i m gonna return it and save up some money to get a bb preamp you should check out the badasss distortion from mxr too love this pedal the mod button just makes it sound like tremolo to me and i have great classic fender tremolo on the amp i use so i don t use that option much i just use it for when i want a little slap back and it works great for that and provides a real nice analog tone thank goodness amazon doesn t sell this gadget for the forty dollar retail price tag i just got mine today and tried it out the sound quality complaints are no joke there is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the irig or iphone while playing will create a loud static noise don t know if a better quality jack on the irig would ve solved this problem or not but if you re willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings you may find a happy medium that you can live with still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool if i find the need to really use one of these i ll probably spring for something that plugs into the iphone dock connector until then this ll be a fun toy to play with march just a quick addendum to my initial review i ve since discovered the noise filter in the amplitube iphone app and wow what a difference it sounds much much better now no more hiss no more static i don t really care for the fx loop on my fender supersonic head as i started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the mxr pedals so when this came out last year i snatched one up and started experimenting with it i love it bypassed i still get that in your face strait into an amp sound but ingage it with my delays and phase s and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss very cool and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank
13	works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too i have tried a few and this is the one i settled on if you need a multi tool the cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up the winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good i first used the snark when i borrowed a friends before a show and i thought it was the coolest thing in the world he used it to tune his acoustic electric and at first i thought it was working off of sound but then i put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric and it picked it up instantly and tuned it perfectly i couldn t beleive it i had to have one i ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning and vibration tuning as well has having the tap beat metronome and i am in love with it it s so sensitive and so accurate you can turn the mic off and use it to tune your electric guitar in a very loud room and it won t pick up ambient noises love it love it love it i recommend this to all musicians the mic feature would be useful on your music stand or attached to your trumpet tuba saxophone whatever clamp it on and play absolutely awesome i love this assortment every color and size you ll ever need you can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while this was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality i would buy this again or recommend to anyone i use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though definitely a star purchase
14	this capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck for example a les paul or most acoustics for thinner necks like a strat or tele it works ok but has to be positioned just right to prevent string buzz it s not the ole clip it and go capo i m used to i bought this to have a capo i could just leave clipped on my acoustic s head for use when needed no dice neck too thick it s a washburn dreadnaught we re not talking some funky string jazz guitar bottom line it s cheap as dirt and you can make it work if you don t mind having to place it just right my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one that s easy first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand it is now taped together while i wait for a different kind to replace it i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out this one is definitely the best i use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke you do have to find the sweet spot but once you do it works great through my pignose amp and actually fits right inside my pignose great value and price too this is a cheaper alternative to the string swing wall mount considerably less expensive it works fine it s easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well the only downside is that the wall anchors aren t the heavy duty plastic screw in types but the smaller drill a hole and hammer in place types which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others of course you can always purchase a couple of screw in heavy duty mounts and you ll still save considerably this of course doesn t have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing for the lower price you get black plastic but it s sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job if it had sturdier wall mounts i d give it stars as it is the cheaper and less trustworthy mounts bring it stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative it is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw in mounts should hold any size guitar
15	sounds simply great as greasy as a pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume it changes its distortion the louder the more distorted the pignose power supply pignose ac power supply for pignose is helpful when been home but also works with aa batteries you can also amplify it s sound by connecting it to a higher watt amp it comes with really nice looking stickers i m planning to keep it for years update on review jan i admit that it might be more expensive that other watt amps but as time goes by i just fall more in love with my piggy i ve learned to use better it s own volume combined with the guitar s i have other amps of higher power that can get a lot louder that the pignose but i just love the level of distortion it gives i cannot get this crunch with the other amps no matter how much pedals bells whistles i have tried this crunch is unique and the world loves it as simple and plain as that the good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch i so much fell in love with the chords give a clean amazing sweet grumble the one that make teenage girls sigh for you with high volume on the piggy and low on the guitar the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast i tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn t make much difference i hope it goes away with use the string cutter works like a champ i was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings these work much better they don t cut the string they shear it off i ve done sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter not my first intellitouch tuner i really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar too thick no flexibility sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings tried on bass too again with less than satisactory results i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two sounded lovely for the first hour that s why two stars granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can t recommend personally i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy
16	originally i purchased a behringer eq equalizer pedal for my rig it was cheap at around some change but like the other reviewers noted it s noisy with hiss so i took the advice of another reviewer bought the fish chips model by danaelectro and it s terrific i plugged it directly in line on my skb pedal board turned them both on turned on the amp put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max no discernible hiss nor hum mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable this pedal has a cool s style appearance it has a great punch when you raise up the level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar amp sounds for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the price tag if you re in the market for a great band eq pedal then you ll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one this product rates out of possible stars i usually use dunlop big stubby picks i used the master control pick for the first time today and i just had to order two more because they re so amazing the attack is second to none at first the pick felt a bit strange as i m accustomed to the thicker dunlop and i have to admit that initially i was a bit weary of the notably thinner dava but in no way has my playing been hindered if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly and by far these are the most comfortable picks i ve ever used what a find update still the best pick i ve ever played if you re worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings don t worry they won t at least not from what i ve seen also pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks i got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp like the other reviewers on here i m sad to report that it s quite hissy i had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is i m using a line uber metal boss metal zone ibanez la metal boss compressor sustainer with my skb pedal board the board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up but when i put the eq in with the others there s a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp i m using a peavey special transtube combo above you can definitely hear the hiss not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but i m going to give the danaelectro fish chips as recommended by another reviewer a try i m waiting on the behringer orchestra chorus pedal to arrive and hoping it isn t hissy like the eq is i will say though i do like the tone influence this pedal has it does a nice job of altering the tone gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds overall i give this pedal a out of stars wow i got more than i expected from this chromatic tuner sure it s a plastic case but who would be rough on a pedal anyways had it about weeks now and im impressed i see people say the blue indicator light is too bright but truthfully its ok because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough if it is too bright for you just put a little piece of black tape over the light but like i said its ok cause you can still see the tuner lights i use this pedal with thevisual sound one spot combo pack works like a charm a must for every serious guitar player this is one of the easiest to use slides that i have ever owned i have been playing for about years i play mostly classic rock this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case this holds up very well because i have a way of abusing a slide dunlop does it again most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything i would say however i still want to say i love this tool not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt it s been useful to help me learn the letters of keys slowly i am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that i know where i am on the fretboard where i can go from there i use it by putting it on my music stand dialing in the key i want turn on the drum machine simply play the chords in that key to the beat then when i want to practice the relevant scales of the key i simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note it s that easy i will say that i do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned to really grasp it one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly but with rote repetition eventually comes that eureka moment from time to time more falls into place unlike some others i m not one to lug something this around in my gig bag who really is going to set study material like this prior to a gig that s what you do at home and it s called practice for a reason i give this out of stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory if not you may want to take some lessons then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons
17	these are great i have these on all my guitars only problem is the clip on install to the strap if you can t get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place once installed you are good for life i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results it helped some but didn t get rid of the noise entirely it also makes the strings feel nice as well i will continue to use it they sound great they helped revive an old acoustic guitar that had been buried in a closet for years along with a very thorough cleaning i don t have any opinion on the feel of these strings like some reviewers i honestly didn t notice anything different i bought them because i wanted great strings on an old cheap guitar in order to get the best sound possible these strings did that just fine the guitar now sounds great job completed i use this often to record my band s gigs now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks the plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of very thin plastic and cracked in two within a week of light use i guess i can redo it with electrical tape to make it work but i have many whirlwind cables that have lasted me years i expected more from this manufacturer but i guess the quality is not the same as it used to be it stopped working after gigs i m not sure why but it is very frustrating i guess you get what you pay for here great product easy to use and i was able to shield my entire jazz bass it would have been nice to get a little more of it though since this was just enough
18	though i d warn if you don t know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de esse the whole thing but between the pop filter and a slightly off center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses s from making an appearance in any way i ve used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting this one is the worst the plastic screw yes plastic that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to is completely incapable of supporting it s own weight at nearly any angle bad just bad secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement after twisting on it twice i stripped it out now the thing is worthless i m returning it asap i would rather go to a lady s bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady pop filter if you don t you ll wish you did at sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic would need a heavier base for use with a boom does its job good solid construction support cords seem to be of good quality knob tightens well comes with thread adapter smooth silver satin finish affordable price nuff said just buy one already i bought this microphone for youtube podcasting and it does a really perfect job the quality is great for me it was what i had expected it to be i also bought a desktop mic stand with it as well as a shockmount and popfilter highly recommended
19	i ve had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven t failed me once i love them and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so they rotate in full circles and are super durable you should buy them for all your guitars and you ll never have to worry again they are also very easy to use and install very nice guitar hanger easy to install and it floats away from the wall the back of the guitar never touches the wall i bought my first one from amazon over a month ago and simply fell in love with it it cleans polishes wood metal although for strings i use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc with wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids i even recently bought a nd just because and yes the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use i knew it was time when it wasn t wiping off the smudges as quickly it came out with a slightly nappy texture to be expected really but still works as well as ever there is a vast amount of different polish cloth brands out there but you won t go wrong with this one i ve been using this for my beater guitar and it has done just fine in the back of my car etc it isn t bulletproof but you d have to pay a lot more for airline level protection anyway medium padding and a decent sized zipper pocket more than i expected for the price the compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons school or a gig works well
20	i love this thing action is perfect great sound good feel easy to play i highly recomend this ordered one of these gig bags for a new les paul the hard shell cases are back ordered and i didn t want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust fits a lp studio perfectly has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket does the job this is not my first planet waves locking strap they have never failed though the selection of colors and widths are very very limited it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks but for me these work just fine highly recommended great price for picks spanning from light heavy picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks i needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons this worked well for that
21	this set of strings is fantastic i ve been playing for over ten years now and have tried everything from elixirs to d addario to martin to john pearse you see where i m going with this and many more i have to say that for the money these strings are in a class of their own when i first started playing i loved the coated strings i wouldn t buy anything but elixirs for years then i got married and money became tight and for a pop a set elixirs wasn t looking as good as they used to so i tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball amazing they are not coated but after a while i got used to that and now actually prefer non coated strings these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought and the medium light set is just perfect nice size high e string so i don t feel like i m going to snap it when i do a pull off and good bass response all in all a fantastic set of strings that you can t afford not to try and at why wouldn t you give them a shot we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered more you can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar and minimize string stress and de tuning each time you move your capo very nice product i bought this for my new string guild acoustic i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them the reason i tried this one is because it s necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them and with strings it really put a lot of tension on them another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves you slip the included packs into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings they should last months you don t do anything else also comes with a rd one for the headstock with others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they don t dry out i also used a dampit but because it hangs from a cord it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acoustic electric i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also so based on the reviews from amazon and a friend who swears by these pickups i decided to put one into my taylor i am extremely pleased this was my brother s guitar and he had a mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop it sounded terrible i tried messing with placement to get it to sound better but it just didn t sound good had tons of feedback and just didn t have a good feel i installed this pickup myself i have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars and this one was pretty painless i didn t have to drill out the endpin hole so it only took me about minutes to install this bad boy when i tested it out i was blown away it sounded beautiful just like my taylor only louder the true test was an actual live performance i brought my baggs para acoustic d i and i was glad i did i was able to adjust the eq just a tad cut some of the mid range a bit and it sounded even better i could not believe it it literally gave me chills if you re on the fence about this pickup go for it the reviews don t lie this sounds fantastic especially if you can eq it a bit i did plug in without the padi just to test it and it still sounded good if i forgot my padi i would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system it might be labeled as passive but it s got the volume of an active system for sure it s a great buy in my opinion this soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player right up there with a tuner string winder cutter cleaning cloth pack of extra picks and capo it s designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system which it does nicely it s also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly as in nights like that in a case
22	people complain that these aren t really rolling string trees despite the fact that the description never says or even implies they are in fact rolling string trees honestly they don t need to be at least for most guitars these small round guides are superior to the flat wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings less contact means less friction less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don t have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move i put them on a cheap telecaster copy i have and noticed the results immediately and i did not replace either the tuners or the nut those are still the cheap stock parts if you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot rollers might be a little better but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade anyone can change them all you need is a screwdriver it was a no brainer for my telecaster this is an inexpensive sturdy sustain pedal that i immediately buy every time i get a new yamaha keyboard this pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano much better than any footswitch only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity it may or may not work properly with non yamaha keyboards long short drop in replacement for both my mim and mia strat added mass easier to tune good cheap easy upgrade
23	not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings hope that helps thank you this is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder why didn t i think of that it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down every few weeks keeps the strings clean and best of all i don t find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since i started using this instead of the cheesecloth i used to use definitely holds the guitar well a little pricey but probably worth it i m a fan of dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one this is a great winder steel shaft will probably last one of these should come standard issue with every guitar before we get started i am more pro than amateur i work at a church as a pastor of worship arts and use this in my work but i hesitate to say i m only pro because amateur means you do something purely for the love of it and i feel that way about music so first the models i ve tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers i ve used which includes logic studio s amps these sound almost as good btw pod x live and xtpro the hd models are noticeably better and the fizz is gone gone gone the original pod and which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time and the tonelab se which i missed for a while but not anymore i made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a bassman x alongside the dr z and it is the coolest sound i ve ever made with this guitar easily better sounding to my ears than the real amps i ve been using maybe because i put them off stage and don t run them very loud i adore the sound of this unit oh and as always forget about all the pre sets they re probably all as useless as you imagine they might be now the bad news and it s significant for some first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x live just forget about trying to use the display connect to a computer seriously when you start from an init patch you only get lucky it seems to manage to coax it into two amp config next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it s specs you will almost certainly not be able to do fx at once the way you re thinking why let s say you use an xt or a x think about what you re used to you start with fxsubtract effect banks for volume pedal you need to use an effect bank you might be able to use an analog pedal but i like my volume after my compressor so i have to do it in the loop i guess fx loop only works with an effect bank line is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade seems like you could noise gate used to be always available don t worry if you mix this with the m as i plan to do though as the m has a great gate i mostly use clean or just barely broken up amps so i might be able to skip this wah this is always available and active in the x and below post eq the x live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot in addition to all the other fx too you need to dedicate an fx bank now so you might only have fx left for me put in a clean boost and tube drive which i think sound better in this box than they did in the m probably because they re digitally part of the signal is all i can think and a verb for the amp no slots left what if you need delay and modulation eek i have to re think the way i use fx in this box still evaluating how that will work for me what if you re a guy like me who was using the x live occasionally as a one box solution for a dual voice guitar all my guitars have piezo bridges no dice i will have to use an acoustic preamp no matter i have one i will probably dedicate a null amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it in addition there aren t as many computer recording routing options as the x live and the super sweet ability to switch between two fx chains in one patch instead of switching programs is gone as far back as my old vox tonelab se i could literally switch channels from one amp cab to another in the same fx chain you could do something similar on the x live not here also line why on earth can t you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interface with this unit how complicated can that really be in short the x live has significantly significantly more flexibility imho than this unit for many of us at least and ought not to have been discontinued imho for some of you it s still a viable option you also still might need your other fx i thought it might be possible that this unit even if i needed to use my ag stomp for my acoustic side again which i m happy to do would bump my m off the stage it did not at first but after a while i did indeed get rid of the m and don t miss it that said i think from what i m hearing that some of the fx especially the dirt pedals work far better inside this box than they do in the m when you connect it to a pod or amp my favorite patches so far that i ve made which use the bassman model and the unbelievable dr z model far and away my favorite amp model evah don t leave any room for modulation or other special fx i m not a switch whole patches on the fly guy i turn fx off and on but after a bit of tweaking and patch making i discovered that for my sounds i didn t need dual amp chains that often so i have all my flexibility back so am i complaining about these limitations no because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary i d take off a full star for this shortcoming but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that i can t do it there will at some point i hope be a next generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings but i have to say for this price i am totally satisfied with the sound in the meantime am i willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one heck yes it sounds that good i even love the models of amps i know i ll never use for the first time ever and after a few months of experimenting i was able to make patches that completely worked for my two voice guitar stuff with no additional outboard gear if i didn t want so i ve simplified to where i wanted to and no longer feel like i m really compromising anything so started with a rig consisting of the hd and sometimes an m and an acoustic preamp currently a yamaha ag stomp mixed in with the hd signal through the aux input i ve now gotten to the point where i can do everything i want if i need without the additional pedals and i sold the m i kept a few analog pedals and such that i just like but rarely take them out of the house anymore i m only nit picking so that you will know all the trade offs for what i have been fantasizing about basically an m in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box this is as close as we re probably going to come and did i mention the sound it s seriously great update i have learned that i will indeed have no problem replacing my m as well and sold it off i thought i d miss it but i don t update as of february i have supplemented this product with a black james tyler variax jtv korean and it s a marriage made in heaven if you are going to go with this product and if you are looking for a new guitar check out the new variaxes totally amazing i use this for working on my guitars mainly it does the job well and is pretty large it s very soft and padded as well as anti static
24	i didn t expect this cable to be so thin it s easily the thickness of any guitar cable i ve used not sure about long term durability or signal loss interference if i had the foresight i d spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable still it works and was inexpensive edit months later and it s dead already wire frayed at the right angle jack you get what you pay for it is not a replacement for a ts or but it has its own tone and overdrive which works good enough the rat has been used by everyone from david gilmour to dave grohl to give you a grasp of its range it does everything from light crunch to marshall style thick rhythms to all out face melting distortion rich harmonics near infinite sustain and a mid range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it the fact that it s built like a tank ensures it s going to be around a long time after my playing days are over the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones the bad the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination unless you like hyper distorted noise the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied the effects are hit and miss as well plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it s downright offensive throw in the fact it chews through batteries the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use and how it loses its small and portable factor with a guitar cable headphone cable and power adapter plugged into it i d be hard pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones this is a great effect i am very happy with it awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there it is very sensitive and delivers as it should with a delay rate from to miliseconds most units offer a max of around the mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended i could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor reverb pedal harmonizer ring modulator etc the line m seemed like a good way to have a jack of all trades pedal on my board for those times i needed one specialized effect i have to say that it serves that purpose in spades i have an all analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers i was wrong to worry digital has come a long way almost all of the effects sound great to my ear especially into a tube amp true bypass means no tone suck to boot high points for the delays reverbs and mods i am not a fan of all of the drives but the overdrive and boost comp sound pretty awesome the rat model classic distortion sounds exactly like my proco rat wish i could say the same for the big muff model but i guess they couldn t get them all right the only issue is i liked it so much i could not resist the urge to get the m so i can run three effects simultaneously however if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the m is a winner
25	use this for my desk mic at home it hold my mic right where i want it and doesn t move from where i place it worth every penny and then some i ve tried several portable amps for the price the honeytone can t be beat it has volume tone and overdrive knobs the overdrive can go way too over so easy on that one comes with a battery but can be connected to a v adapter important note reverse polarity negative central interestingly i have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic electrics or piezo based pickups better than magnetic pickups but for a small portable light weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone they don t come much better it has a belt clip on the back but you ll have to supply your own earphones and v adapter if you want them battery is included of course a guitar cable is a required extra well worth the money this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band i also wanted to use it on my xbox to play guitar hero and rock band but it s not recognized by either game as a mic that was surprising since it s a usb mic it is a tiny mic it ll fit completely on your palm but it can record very loud noises very clearly it is also very sensitive when set to room recording excellent product smart design excellent performance what more could you want the samson meteor mic usb studio microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use with great pick up for desktop podcasts user testing screencasting and similar being a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic i had to look up what cardioid meant i found a solid explanation at a site called wisegeek they explain cardioid several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks some such as condenser microphones pick up a great deal of sound from several directions while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction of this latter group the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable it gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis this means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides my apologies to those pros out there who didn t need this clarification having used the samson go mic usb compact mic for a few months i was familiar with the samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the amazon vine program i had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the go mic but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the time i ve been happy with thesamson go mic compact usb microphone plug n playfor use with my desktop and laptop pcs i do a lot of usability testing for various websites and it s imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise pops hisses or similar i have to say that the samson meteor is a touch better offering clear crisp recording and reproduction it also seems to pick up virtually no background noise which is fabulous i like the retro styling of the meteor and the built in stand is great for desktops less portable than the samson go mic the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch the included usb cable is also of ample length for easy set up in a multitude of situations the mute button on the front of the meteor is very handy much easier than using software to get the job done and an amber light makes it easy to recognize it s muted the build quality of the mic is excellent very solid high end feel you can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the front the samson meteor didn t ship with any software which while unnecessary for installation my windows and pcs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included usb but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with it another product i m reviewing the samson c ucw studio usb mic with cakewalk sonar leand the samson go mic both ship with cakewalk software the samson go mic with cakewalk music creator le and the c ucw ships with cakewalk s sonar le software so i found it kind of surprising the meteor did not at this price point for me it works out as the others have the software and they work with the meteor the included booklet includes a quick start guide for pc and mac installation how to the layout diagrams specifications polar patten frequency response and recording techniques for vocals acoustic guitar piano guitar amp and overhead drum kit the samson meteor mic warranty card is also in the booklet overall i m very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the go mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using dragon voice recognition software i have purchased an adapter to use it with my ipad so i can play with garage band and know it will be great for future screencasts my only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package which other samson products as mentioned have packaged with them i give this product out of stars i like it for this reason if samson included software it d be a star product for me i received these tascam headphones as part of the amazon vine review program i was excited to receive them as i ve looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and professional grade designation i m not an audiophile nor am i snob about audio devices any brand that works well at the right price i ll buy it that being said i ve recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones with thebose ae w bluetooth headphones blackbeing the most recent obviously the bose beat the tascam ones so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that sound wise you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range these tascam th r professional grade headphones don t sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges bass is great but even when tweaking the equalizer settings i never could find the clarity i was seeking in the full range i listened to several genres classical blues pop rock electronic country and latino with these headphones each time the quality was good but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iphone pc andyamaha rx v channel network d av receiver with airplay black the fit of the headphones is big for me usually they are too small having them as small as i could make them top of my head to ears the cups still dropped down a bit lower than i liked i had to hold them in place to get a solid fit the padding underneath the headpiece is minimal and after about minutes of use the top of my head hurt the build quality of these phones appears to be excellent the cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated the screw on adapter mm to mm allows for use with multiple devices stereo components and sound boards the foldable design does allow for some size reduction but not much these headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass great for those who want the chunky headset look are on the go djing and or have larger heads they are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening they re also not for those with smaller heads
26	i use this cable for small home recording projects i do not take the cable around to gigs or shows as i am pretty sure it wouldn t last longer than a few months of heavy use the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy if your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job this is your product really a nice mic i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs makes my voice sound fantastic i read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mine worth a shot if you re on a budget like me ordered this and two cables this came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit i recommend nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it happy buyer thank you very much i admit i got this from guitar center on clearance but over the past week or so i ve had it i just love plugging into it i ve got a great vintage larger amp but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions and i m anticipating spending some time in apartment living so i was looking for a small tube based amp this thing gives great tone with both a strat and a les paul clone and an overdrive pedal works very well with it of course it s not too loud that s the whole point i should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps don t have but it s really low volume also the tubes do take a minutes to warm up and since it doesn t have a standby switch you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in but it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears or those of anyone else great little amp
27	as a guitarist who s had the opportunity to work at guitar center back in trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task while i ll chose d addario exl s for electric martin sp are my top choice for acoustic the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them granted that s only aesthetic i heard about these from a friend several years back i teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services these strings allow me to keep on keepin on for several weeks at a time even with constant usage i wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions old screws rust and often when presented with a new pick guard there are instead of holes for attachment this package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms it looks nice on our fender blacktop bass plus the locks it completely changed the look of the bass details acquired a strat without a trem and ordered this one it fits perfect and even though i m not a huge whammy user it s nice to have for that occasional vibrato there s no substitute for the right part these are great i like having extras around just in case i rescue another orphaned guitar to rebuild the springs are almost always missing cost less here than at guitar center so bada bing it s not an entire bridge assembly but it s exactly what i needed in my opinion it is worth the money what else can be said about aquila high priced ukuleles have them standard for a reason they are simply the best even if you have a very cheap ukulele adding these strings can turn a toy uke into something that wont embarrass you i use aquila and martin strings in my ukuleles the aquila for most performances and the martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional hawaiian sound as the aquilas are a tad heavier than martin even if this if you only have one ukulele and you won t for long you can t go wrong with these strings the tabs broke off right out of the package the other reviews made me aware this may happen an easy fix with some super glue and for the price who cares if i have to fix it it is accurate and very easy to use other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money highly recommend i use this for my uke my string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty taylor easy to use very accurate highly recommended joyo continues to surprise me this thing is all metal looks very sleek is true bypass and all around works well the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool the only reason i didn t give it stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch you can see the led on nearly every other joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look however it doesn t even show up in the product picture on amazon it wasn t a big deal i just drilled a little ish hold and it fits through
28	its sound pretty good i mean the range rate arent as broad as others i ve tried but i stomp on it regularly it cuts my signal a bit so i compensate an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up all in all worth it been using it for a month or now had absolutely no problems good constructio looks good angled end is a good fit price is good this cable expands the capability of the one spot or godlyke v adapter the quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards havent used it yet seems like a nice pedal nice an lightweight clean has some nice rubber on the bottom lol haha okaaaaaay and nice its like really just wow you know like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough i like it with the power supply no batteries to fuss with nice sound
29	these martin strings m aren t bad they just are not the sound i was looking for i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead the martin s are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball other people will love them though they are easy to play as a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal holy grail of guitar picks i am no exception dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the dollar picks you name it i ve tried it even nail picking on metal strings now if you are new to the perfect pick quest you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your grail different however if you play a light metal string acoustic my main is an aria af tenor guitar check out these dunlops nylons even within the dunlop line i have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same gage didn t acoustically perform quite the same would i try another pick if the chance was presented sure most of us would since the quest for the holy grail never truly ends but until then dunlop s nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection my guitar originally came with d addrio exp and they sounded good i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good but the finish was wearing fast this time i got a pack of ej d light the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly but the sound is the problem it s terrible they sound very muddy crisp tone distinction is just not there i thought light would be the better route but now i m not sure i purchased some others to try also since a purchased a pack i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings great price and helped out with recording to a tascam track cassette which i like using on occasion vs digital and just plain useful with so many other apps excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq i did have to sand to make it fit that may sound badm but i am glad because it s better than too small i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering i m happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for good deal
30	the only reason i give stars is because i ordered of these and had the chord with it and one was missing the chord i ordered both at the same time other than that they are good hot mics this is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord it s no peavey but it works just as good i bought two of these one for each of my sons and i wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age so far they seem awesome they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them definitely not a flimsy stand received these with lightining speed they came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up alot of adjustments to these and they actually adjusted high enough for me at to be able to sing at lemmy s angle great for singing micing amps and such these are each at a local music store so update these are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer s mic but if you grab it with some enthusiasm the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand i used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that i still say they are good for the price just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen
31	as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal i completely agree with that and it will sustain your notes it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate i use the ns when i use my chain of pedals that said this pedals has some wonderful uses every note will have the same volume you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume you can set it to sustain for days again you will need a noise gate there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as active as this one perhaps that s the price you pay for what this pedal can do i recommend messing with it quite a while you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it ive been using this polish since the early s it doesn t smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars what has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them but this polish no way martin knows what they re doing i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound i change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit i can go to weeks for hard playing i started using fender strings with the stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat they sounded great i use these for my telecaster in factory spec and they are real nice too i do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets i have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period stick to nickel and you will be glad you did i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster works great i didn t notice any change in tone it just worked like the old one but the main this is that it worked and my tele sounds as great as it always did not a flashy strap but great in the studio or on stage when you need to change guitars fast light weight allows you to remove quickly it is pretty comfortable to wear also if you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth this is a fantastic amp for you fender has done an amazing job with this amp in this amp you have all of the benefits of tubes warmth at all dynamic levels as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playing the champ circuit forget the fact that you have digital amp models built in too you also have a w champ tube amp with a inch speaker it s not exactly a champ reissue but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any champ out there people who like a great champ tone would pay more than for a great w champ amp add to this digital presets fender gives you digital models through a tube circuit of tweed amps blackface amps hot rod amps as well as metal amps a jazz amp and an acoustic sounding model add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the digital models are and they are absolutely right but this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a tweed or hot rod tone directly to an authentic champ amp not a model of a champ amp the real deal the implications of this amp are really huge i d love to see fender do the same thing with a pro jr or even a blues jr amp perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp who knows but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character the digital presetsfor me the highlights are the authenticity of the tweed blackface and hot rod tones i really feel like channel sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the inch speaker the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome the blackface clean sounds like a princeton and i even think they were trying to emulate a deluxe reverb on channel as far as volume people ask is it loud enough to gig with sure it can get loud enough over drums etc but i d mic it anyway i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume mic it and you can play it anywhere the only downsides as much as fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads this amp really doesn t give metalheads that much to work with it would be a great practice amp for any guitarist blues metal jazz or country but the metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs lack of a mid control i m not sure that i understand why you d have an eq with treble and bass with no mid control personally it s the eq knob that i would use the most but if you are switching between digital presets you have to work with the treble and bass to find the sweet spot for your mids to my ears it s not in the same spot on all presets that one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets this amp is cool and unique which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when fender releases the next big new thing line and vox tube digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability this is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with years later truly a unique and versatile creation great strings used them for years always loved them put them on an eric johnson strat wouldn t use anything low quality for that guitar i have countless delay pedals and racks this inexpensive delay is very special it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay it won t give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for it sounds great clean or dirty it s a relatively short delay which is great for many genres long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal eric johnson like music i would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment it s bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you ll be near the dark side of the moon many musicians use two delay pedals i know i often do this one is my main delay and my nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for the unit itself seems sturdy and well made i use carbon zinc batteries in mine they just seem to sound better to my ears keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time true bypass and no hiss great surprise as i never took rogue seriously never thought it d be my goto pedal my classical guitar stand was metal and short like this but did not have the front brace or download slant if i had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it s headstock on the hard flood so sad i mourn it still
32	i enjoy this very much very good strings it s a good brand too i recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have pretty disappointed in the color as the review title indicates what i received is more of a black chrome or dingy stainless color these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad some are very dull looking very disappointing really unless you guys are receiving something i am not how can you give this anything more than one star my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my fender stratocaster this is inexcusable all the other fender backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route but not this mint green one i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost i bought this tube to test in a friends fender hrd in the pi spot he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain he liked the result when i switched out the gt ax i want to try a jan at next but the jj is doing a good job for now also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek s for jj l gc s i ve tried the fishman ft and the tune tech ttm i like this one the best it seems as accurate as my other tuners like all clip on tuners there are sweet spots on the head that work better than others oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner the snark was fine the biggest plus i see on the snark and the reason its my new go to tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen my vision isn t so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful i don t have to guess or squint it has a metronome which can be fun i personally don t use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so i don t want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when i really need it the only minus that i can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce i don t have a custom made brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing if you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you ll trust it if not then the fishman is more your speed
33	it says for a banjo or a mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box it is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on off is really easy whether you re a beginner or have been playing for a long time you can never go wrong with ernie ball strings i had purchased a peak violin stand but wasn t thrilled with the height of the violin bow holder the tip of the bow dangled just a bit too close to the floor for my comfort this being designed to hold either a violin or a viola allows more height and i feel that the bow is safer additionally this stand allows my violin to be placed on it with the shoulder rest in place while the peak stand was less secure unless i removed the shoulder rest so this stand is more versatile for a performing situation and for days at home when i want to have my violin handy and ready to play as time allows warning do not use any violin stand at all if you have a cat or dog which can come into the room where the violin is resting on the stand the stand does have a lock to help keep the violin on the stand but it would be very easy to knock the whole thing over if a dog or cat were in a playful energetic mood this tuner has a bright backlight a padded clip it rotates pivots does flats and calibration from hz to hz simple to use runs on one cr pancake battery included what s not to like stars all the way i have others in different cases and one on my work bench they have been very dependable and easy on batteries this one goes in a case for a tele copy that i just finished additional edit this particular unit does not respond a quickly as other identical tuners that i have i is accurate just doesn t respond to the string a fast i still give it stars this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than day after it had arrived the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made i do not recommend this product
34	these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors i feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers and they look professional too impressed with this set i installed them today and have been playing for a few hours my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree im not sure if they are supposed to be flush and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out i think my guitars tone has improved a little too but i also installed new strings qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins i use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out individual volumes controls make it perfect this pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter it is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome exactly what i was looking for and for the price i can not get a better deal totally satisfied
35	my cry baby is about years old and is the oldest pedal on my board i have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the potentiometer to give the wah a broader range but it really doesn t sound any better this pedal covers the white room by cream tone perfectly i gave it stars because it hasn t been maintenance free the pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives i probably should give it i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well they are easy to install on the bass and the strap i love the tortex mm picks red i have one that s over years old and still going strong yes the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings i use the red yellow and orange tortex s exclusively for practice and performance i m a church worship leader my highest recommendation while i love and trust d addario strings i am subtracting one star because i really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once i think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound anyway these are classic strings that i grew up with but as i get more involved with playing having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated especially if you like to save your single strings for use works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain this is a great pedal for price no it s not the most amazing phase pedal but it s still quality i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board if you don t use a lot of phaser but need it for a song or buy it this was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on it s easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops i recommend it to all aspiring musicians boosts the signal without too much noise though not totally quiet good for lead w single channel amps boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strength especially at lower practice volumes should be inexpensive i was amazed by the quality of construction of this item it looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows the chrome on the sides looks very cool makes it look really smart the battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom the sound of this wah is pretty much exactly like hendrix clapton from the sixties its a wah and wah and does just that i tried it on both clean and distorted sounds and it sounds great on both i m not sure if its a true bypass but i have a feeling it is because when its switched on without the battery there s no sound coming from it correct me if i m wrong it s different sounding from the crybaby wah you should listen to both to know which is right for you i wanted the tales of brave ulysses sound so i went with this
36	kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but i only use it for walking around the house strumming when i am playing my secondary guitars it s fine for the price if your a beatle fan or just someone who collects picks this is the perfect item for you great graphics i m a guitar pick collector and this is by far the best that i have so if you don t have this beatle set go and get it despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc sounds better than any sound card i ve used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency it s a great intro model not just for ipads whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord i m so impressed my main pc audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device it s an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
37	i have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body people watching me can t really see it and it s right where i need it full of picks if i drop one wonderful little invention buy it if you don t want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket works and it is good no problem very standard one all your own preferences so you need to try it out before you say if that works for you this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag i ve played guitar for some years and have found d addario strings to be of consistently good quality they are one of maybe three companies i trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel their strings produce excellent sound and are durable like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing but i ve never played a set of this brand that i didn t like they always provide vibrant tonal quality and no i don t work for d addario just a long time fan the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way i d hoped i could not be more pleased with this product it actually delivers much more sound than i expected i just needed this for my new guitar from the looks of it it complements the instrument well i am happy with it if you re in the need for a guitar capo then this is a pretty good offering for it being pretty cheap i had to get it shipping was fairly fast and it s ready to use straight out of the package d this thing works great tiny and seems to be accurate the price is darn good as well a must for all guitarists good basic first amp great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house compact size makes storage easy
38	i realy like the cutter the only thing for me was the peg winder was getting in the way with just a simple screw it comes right off i much prefer it without the winder build quality is awesome sturdy and a bit weighty definitley worth a buy unfortunately the first one of these i ordered from amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place take two the second set i received was in great condition and i m really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost this kit literally has everything you will need except new strings of course to keep your guitar looking and sounding great first time for a soft wedgie pick that is i did have an older brother i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great very good price and looks like they will last awhile i highly recommend they for you to try if you don t like they you can give a fellow musian a soft wedgie which they just may like great strap for the price absolutely no complaints issues at all light weight but sturdy i was able to put strap locks on this strap with no issues and it works great comfortable as well i ve had two of these tuners and they do a fine job as far as i can tell i lost one and had to buy another one i also bought a much more expensive tuner and i cannot see that it does a better job than this one i bought my first tuner like this one about years ago and the rubber pads kept falling off but i have not had that problem with my new one my wife was worried about what to get me for christmas i really didn t want anything other than the harley i have been asking for for years maybe next and while surfing amazon i came across this les paul i had to laugh since it looks so much like my gibson les paul kind of like a mini me version well i have never heard of a les paul uke and did not think for that it would be much but the reviews were telling a different story so i found my christmas present at last for the man who has everything it is true my wife told me still hoping for that harley though i ordered it a few days before christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife s dismay but i printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway well christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing the uke not the harley but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when i opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby les paul i figured since i was taking my fellow amazonian s word i better order some aquila ukulele strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the uke are junk and they are shame of epiphone which i did the uke arrived about days before the strings but i attempted to learn how to play it anyway ouch those stock strings were rough on the fingers and the sound left much to be desired so i waited until the new string were installed prior to this review wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers i just love it now so if you decide to get one of these mini me les paul s do yourself a favor and get a set if aqila stringsaquila usa aquila concert ukulele stringsa snark uke tuner sn snark sn ukulele tunera nice leather guitar strapfender plain leather guitar strap with fender logo blackanda daily ukulele song book by jumpin jimthe daily ukulele songs for better living daily ukulele paperback you will love all of these items i am sure when it arrives be sure to practice billie jean played by jim hill see it on youtube it is a riot orjake shimabukuro bohemian rhapsody enjoy
39	it cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand it is very solid and will last a long time i now have two of these really wish now i had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase kicks self and all i can say you simply can t beat it i also have a hercules tri stand x more expensive than this one and between the two gotta admit the only major advantage my tri stand has is saving space which actually is a huge consideration for me i honestly don t know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two musician s gear tubular guitar stands i currently own never once have given me an issue aside from bodily running into the thing and they have held do hold a variety guitars of various styles banjos both open back and bg resonator mandolas anything with a long neck all in all unless there is some specialized stand need i would first come to musician s gear i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now it s time to treat myself with this gift so i don t have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china it s very rare thing to see now a days
40	this is such a nice bag for the price nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever there is a handle and a shoulder strap plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front i use this for my uke my string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty taylor easy to use very accurate highly recommended please don t listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn t keep tune they don t know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient it only took me about half an hour it clearly states starter pack so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele especially because of the price these people just do not know how to read it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight if you want real protection i would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines it is a great buy though considering the price i highly recommend this product what a good buy this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice luv the zip pocket in the front perfect for strap snark capo whatever bought this for my hubby s tenor uke and one just like it tho smaller for my concert uke highly recommend
41	i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases you never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper cutter winder and pin puller gets the job done and it is inexpensive a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good this is the th bass pick that i have tried and finally this works great it does not slide out your hand and has a soft tip with a nice sound brough this for trying electric feels on the acoustic guitar and don t want to waste too much money on electric acoustic preamp guitar or big amp if i don t like the efeels after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it i decided to give it a try i didn t expect too much on amp but surprisingly it positively gives me more than i ask for i also brough it with the adaptor which is great to save for long runs and i don t have to worry about the battery for home practices it is adorable out of the box it looks like a lovely toy but it works professionally based on its w amp i don t care much about the manufactor s suggested modes basically i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar uke i like the small size that won t take too much space on my tiny room it s cute to look at and it is practical too i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup however when i changed to another one i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup i almost thought that was an issue from the amp luckily i have two different pickups to try it deeply after using the better pickup the amp doesn t have any issue yet i have used for few times so i don t know about its longevity yet one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar s sound itself won t be muted but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp anyway it s a great feature to have this bench is great for the keyboards and when i just want to sit and play by bass guitar regarding it being too short you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height to sitting if it is too short then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue
42	i m not a pro by any means i am enjoying this guitar it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range it may tend to overdrive a little bit more than my other guitars again not a pro one of the screws by the jack was loose nearly stripped when i got it a drop of wood glue fixed it had i paid or more for the guitar i d have been upset but as is that was an easy fix my biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less natural that the image appears to be it s pretty enough and fine for a guitar but i really wanted natural wood and it isn t otherwise it would be a star i play it every day this snark thing is the cats meow its absolutely charlie it hears things i don t and tells me whether they are what i want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together if you like being in tune this is probably for you it is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything you can clamp it on a cat s tail but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don t even think about doing that you sicko great design easy to read works better than other brand tuners i own only bummer is you can t carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one if it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about dollars oh well i suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool hip out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity oh the peer pressure i have about quit using picks now but i needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses that s what you get with this from very thin and flexible to and hard you get a selection do not expect this to sound like a fender frontman with x speakers but for practicing in your bedroom or similar it s perfect plenty of sound effects to mess around with are they as good as dedicated per stomp box effects probably not but so what just found out the best part of this amp you can connect it via the usb port to your pc not only for using the rather cheesy fender software but it lets you pipe your guitar s sounds into software like garage band you can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an m audio m track or similar ps it is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the mic or line in in of your computer even with the right adapter plugs as the impedances will not be right on top of that i have connected the mac s headphone audio out to the amp s aux in sounds much better than listening to the pc s normal puny speakers update while the built in usb interface does work a dedicated device with good pre amps like the focusrite i is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer update to the update while i am keeping this amp for convenience i have quickly learned that nothing can match a real tube amp you can simulate all you want and i am talking much more expensive sw solutions its like imitation chocolate vs real chocolate got the marshall dsl watt combo amazing sound
43	these are great strings they are the right length and go on easy enough they are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren t color blind they go on sound bright and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever you only have to change them every months or so i had to reply that forever just doesn t last as long as it used to changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so less that is a good deal even if they don t last forever that means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book worth the extra pesos these are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session the strings keep their tone for a long time can easily last upto a month on daily practice for hours these are the thickest picks i ve ever used however i am really liking them the tone they give seems better to my ears than anything i ve tried and my speed picking has improved works very well and is almost hidden on the guitar it is one of those things that once you have it the other ones that stick out seem poorly designed this one will stay on my guitar the others i always took off once it tune as they look so awkward i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference the nyxl s have a brighter tone good playing ease and stay in tune better when making new string changes if you have a mahogany body guitar such as the les paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies these are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are pertaining to output i am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in acoustic unamplified output but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears these do stay in tune better than my usual ernie balls nickels when you first put them on the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference i find that by lightly sanding the nut with grit paper and using big ben s nut sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other having these nyxl s on there is just one more added benefit i would say if you are looking for a brighter tone with better tuning stability these are the ones to have you can tell from the wall to wall star reviews these are the one to have i can t speak on the claim for a longer string life the strings are true to elixir s quality and tone these strings sound great plug and unplugged i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too there are tonal differences as expected the are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp when amplified i did note less finger noise as i re positioned or slid my fingers along the strings i didn t notice any difference to the feel of the string as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb you re still getting a good deal i ordered this for my husband the musician he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel he would definitely purchase this product again
44	im not loyal to brands on the whole but when i reach for a pick i hope this is the one i get they wear out and get nicks so i have to remember to keep ordering them edit watch the steve vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn nicked picks rapidly firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet the motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick repeat or times and whadda u know the edge is now smooth and nice great concept everything rolled into one product winder string cutter and end pin remover the price is fair for all that if you re always dropping picks losing picks breaking picks this is perfect to have fits about guitar picks or so stickies onto your guitar wherever there seems to be enough sticky ness to move it around a few times and still have ti grip like new i have tried the other brands of strings and this is the other brand i consistently buy its smooth to use and the sound is superb i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop locks i recommend the model they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way but these are just to big and clumsy the model does the same and doesn t take as much space you will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units this is true for either one of the models i have a regular nylon levy strap and these two models and si work well but i prefer the smaller rounder model i use thin picks and so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i don t use i actually like the dunlop brand material so once i get used to thicker ones i ll try these the pack only have and thicker in case you re looking for very thin ones if so then don t buy this sample pack go and buy the dunlop nylon or
45	dunlop pick holder this is very handled always forget were my pick got off too now i know my picks is in the holder after reviewing people reviewer i had no dout it great and it sure was snark has a good tuner for low price thank to amazon and snark i think anyone needs a tunersnark is the best for your money good quality adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos not much more to say but need five more words to post this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner the letters are big so you don t have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning i really like these strings while they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings they still sound better than many other strings and they last so much longer they will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least x probably closer to x nice tactile feel on the right hand with reduced squeak as you move up down the neck bottom line is elixir s sound great play well and least a really long time
46	i think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges what resulted for me was the perfect gauge string they almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights i also think these strings last a decent amount of time particularly if you wipe your strings after playing which i need to get better at doing bottom line i highly recommend these they are the strings that i use and have been using for several years now these are super strings they will last and last and last and give you great sound easy to put on and tune have to reorder soon great strings for the money i play guitar with a cou ple of my buddies and they love them too sound quaility is great this is a pack of guitar strings it sounds good on my guitar and it s not that expensive i like it star rating according to amazon i would rate it stars amazon rating for stars is if you love the product if it made me sound like clapton unfortunately none of the gear that i bought can do this also i kind of find it hard to love a pack of guitar strings this cable expands the capability of the one spot or godlyke v adapter the quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards i bought this for my sigma dmc e it allows my guitar to hang better than the lasso type headstock straps and looks much better they leather is very high quality and is very supple i m using these cables to string effects pedals together i ve had no issues with them so far they seem sturdy enough for rough handling and i m not noticing any extra noise i have an unusually wide and fat thumb and though tight at first all of them got comfortable after an hour of playing each no complaints
47	it s a little harder to open than other capos i ve used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it it s not cheap and flimsy though i don t see this one wearing down anytime soon now stop reading this review and buy this capo you wont regret it you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage this microphone in just a few words is awesome the sound recorded by this device in all modes left nothing to be desired for me i use this mic for voice over work that gets added to videos playing in major hotel rooms superior mic this is the nd tuner like this that i have purchased it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar the battery lasts a long time as well which is not true with all little tuners like this one all in all i am very happy with this purchase small price to pay to be in tune i would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument
48	used these while putting together my personal blues classic rock frankenstrat replaced everything but the body needed these accessories to match a brand new fender pick guard they worked fine at a great price if you need an clone on the cheap this is your pedal don t be fooled though it does not school the classic tube screamer but it holds its own this was a main staple on my pedalboard until i found a great deal on a bad monkey and then sadly it came off i was not looking to replace it at the time it just happened the bad money did what i needed it to do better i recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an but has the budget of your average gigging musician maxon ibanez ts joyo vintage od this pedal solved my problem with my amp after years of messing about with my mesa boogie realizing the the california sound is not what i truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a marshall or vox this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a marshall or vox one can say all kinds of things about quality but for it made me even more versatile it needs to be in front of a tube amp if you want to pay for patch cables and it somehow makes you feel more secure go for it otherwise pick these up great price and certainly gets the job done the colors fit may into your rig or perhaps you can use them strategically that feature is in incidental plus they appear to be solid and will likely last just fine alright it was not i already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most sound sculpting investment you could make as a mid range lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though
49	this is a great strap nice tight fit snug and secure and very flexible best part this strap gets long long long yep here it is nothing fancy about this strap unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end just well made and functional i got this for my grandson s squier by fender size acoustic it doesn t have a strap button at the top end it would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut but i work with leather and i found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand this is a great stand in the past i have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made this one serves the bill i am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable it is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use i use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased this works well with the mandolin it is certainly an easy change i would recommend it or purchase again
50	i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks the best strings i ever bought and i ve bought them all i got these for my electric and the ej p acoustic electric for my acoustic they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy there s another brand out there that is almost identical in construction and quality and costs less don t buy the high rated chrome capped one s i had problems with those this one is good just that i regret paying so much for it easy upgrade fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners make changing strings a whole lot easier glad i did it i picked up this pedal used along with ds keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think long story short the mod ds is getting returned and i m keeping my fulltone ocd first a word about the negative reviews it tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something but the other reviews as of sept were all star reviews it tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didn t know what the pedal was before they tried it and anyone complaining about the price this is a hand crafted pedal that is extremely well constructed the inside circuitry is pristine and built to last for decades i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost now let s talk about how the pedal sounds it s marketed as an overdrive distortion i had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because i indicated i was looking for a distortion pedal but i was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has it is much more an overdrive in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp but boosts the level in gain in a very full rich sound the sound has a lot of bass to it but unlike a tubescreamer ts it s definitely not muddy in fact if you re tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act this might be exactly what you need the battery is accessible behind hand screws and moderately involved to get to but an ac adapter is really the way to go it s a standard plug like you find on boss and ibanez pedals but you can use a v or v i ve read some reviewers say that v gives you more headroom while some actually prefer the v sound honestly i tried both and didn t discern any difference it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinets finally there is an lp hp switch and it s really a matter of preference and setup how you use it i ve been mostly using the lp setting which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that i hate but in a live setting or to use it as a boost for soloing the hp setting could be quite useful as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to cut through the other instruments on stage if i had to summarize this pedal i would describe it as a tubescreamer you can rock with which is not to say that it s better than the tubescreamer necessarily but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your go to for rhythm chord sections soloing or both
51	usb condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing podcasts and for portability the reason being is that they are condensers for one and the other is that this mic has a built in interface an interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and analogue to digital and digital to analogue ad da converters of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer way way better so this mxl studio usb even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential so instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one mxl studio usb all you need is a laptop with a usb input and you there are limitations though with a usb mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your daw recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks the really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money so for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal quick easy and affordable one of the problems with using it in pro tools or any daw is that you can only use one interface at a time since the mic has a built in interface you can t use any other even in garage band for mac although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously so in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a usb mic is not what you need i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio i have the mxl v m which was their early offering but is no longer made and i have found the mxl v to be comparable to that one some other mxl s like the are muddy in the bottom end when bottom fishing for a good decent condenser mic some of the cad offerings are also top sellers when using the mxl usb in win no driver download is necessary if your mic comes without the included cd you can download the free mxl studio control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold there are also output adjustments as well one other thing that is unique about usb mics working with your pc is that they are dependent of course on your pc so i had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when i couldn t get the output from my pc or into the free reaper daw recording software free day trial also downloadable from mxl so i finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in windows accessible via control panel and then sound and then type troubleshooter into the search box in the upper right corner the answer was that my mic input volume inside of windows was down to zero i moved the slider up and bang it worked so for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into it s a mini jack like you have on your computer so with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod casting or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels this mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic capos are not something that i shop for i have had two for years one is a strap type and the other is an expensive k type it is similar to this one yeah in looks only this one blows that one away it has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner it is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways this is great i play a tele and an acoustic martin it works great on both i play professionaly and this is the best thing i ve gotten in two years everything keeps improving and getting better faster and cheaper but at this price point their isn t one available that isn t a compromise in one way or another first off if you are planning on buying the us don t buy its bigger brother the us getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money as well as k makes it a no brainer to get optical on the only at this price is great but the a d d a converters leave a bit to be desired on the other hand the mic pres are pretty good have distortion ratings thd of only and with bit khz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by tascam to date what i meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost to times this price most of them have either good mic pres and weak clocks or vice versa and some work with windows but not so well with mac and once again vice versa etc i researched interfaces for a long long time and considering non crash reliability and a dozen other factors i finally sprung for anrme fireface ufx usb or firewire high performance audio interface in out now that s an interface i have been running it with pro tools since pro tools professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and pro tools is now being released so if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope i would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this tascam us or so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved so what i did was load and register the free and included cubase le complete with activation and elicense registration and installation as well as installing the tascam driver and doing updates for both i know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing daw in order to test out the interface and therefore they didn t need to spend much time with it i don t blame them the shortest distance between two points is a straight line so get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn t happen in just one hour so here goes if you have windows vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list windows xp and i am sure the omission of vista is not a mistake i know mylogitech audiohub notebook speakersare non functional in my vista laptop if you are running windows media center in it as well it works in win just fine so i installed it in my desktop running windows bit and it gives you the option of installing in or in addition to cubase le it also installed ai elements as well as agent one content groove agent one vintage beat boxes steinberg drum loop expansion which took a good amount of time to load as well as steinberg halion sonic se bit for ai elements i then had to activate and register cubase le which involves installing the latest elcc creating a steinberg account which is free and they don t ask you for a credit card they provide you with an activation code after you register i have an ilok for pro tools which is a usb device that enables you to run the program cubase does not require that you have one although they have an equivalent looking device but fortunately they have a software based equivalent they do this with an elicense which you will then update to version there is an elicense control setup and you have a soft elicenser number that you will use in order to generate the activation code generated at the steinberg site what came on my disc was version which they instruct you to immediately do an update which i did to version so we install the tascam interface next which comes on a separate dvd included with the interface is a foot usb printer style cable you will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer windows recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver so install the driver off of the disc first and then do the update it took at least minutes to do that update what flashed on the screen was megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving at first it says this is going to take a long time and they were exactly right it almost tempts you to think something is wrong because nothing is happening other than the scrolling and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says do you want to install and you click continue and then it comes up again in another minute and this happens a few times and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box i have verizon fios and usually download huge amount of data in a flash then you reboot now this is important plug the us directly into an available usb port and not into a hub even if it is a powered hub it simply won t work i tried it and the light wouldn t even come on indicating usb when i went direct the interface lit up and it worked the manuals also warn you not to use it with usb the us comes with a printed quick start guide there is also an owner s manual for both the interface and cubase that are available either on the dvd or by googling the same and they come up as a pdf download if you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading there is a driver to choose input and output settings as well as going into windows control panel sound in order to choose the interface for playback and recording if you re new to these kinds of setups just take your time and don t be dismayed if something doesn t work all it takes is for one button to get pushed and wahlah you have sound for example in cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won t get any sound from the headphones if all else fails you can go to the tascam web site by googling tascam us and then click on the support tab and they have a you pay for it phone call number in order to help you hope this helps ps the real killer deal right now is avid pro tools bundle with the mbox mini which is another limited interface but you are getting pro tools plus purchases of this bundle made after that has pro tools will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools if you register your product with avid considering what pro tools goes for by itself and what the mbox sells for individually and the bundle even comes with the ilok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts i have seen pop up as much as off the already low price then you have pro tools and full blown versions none of this le stuff and an interface and can grow from there this tascam interface works great with pro tools these pro tools bundles are discounted to make way for and i am seeing music stores running out of them they are clearing the shelves preparing for but it has bugs i rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some and get feedback from users after some time and more updates i will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to maybe in another year pt is all i need this works well has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use no adjustments are required for my guitars but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo this capo comes with a pick holder and it is expandable with ad addario ns micro clip on tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm i do not use a pick and i use my own tuners so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs this capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars the other one being theg th performance capo the g capo goes with my takamine new yorker and this planet waves goes on everything else if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo recommended i m a long time d addario user from the time i started playing i ve tried most of the different brands out there and always end up back with my d addarios i got the s to try on my strat and the s to try on my lp and found that these new nyxl strings do have a little better output and stay in tune a little better but the trade off is the cost currently they re on here compared to or less for the regular version so if you burn through a lot of strings that may be a consideration i don t go through strings that frequently i ll change on each guitar every to months so it s not a big concern for me
52	this is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier the first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it this has a replaceable sponge you take it out soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container would say it gets more humidity out just got this stand today first impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression it seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap the base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over the telescope mechanism is quite well made comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters i got mine set up to extend up to ft tall it s quite the perfect height for when i m seated on my stool one thing i did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place it unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved maybe adding something to keep it screwed in would recommend to others probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs the winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast i tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn t make much difference i hope it goes away with use the string cutter works like a champ i was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings these work much better they don t cut the string they shear it off i ve done sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter no complaints whatsoever product is a solid build and prices right knobs work well and the stand doesn t slip legs hold up pretty well also this strap is genuine suede leather so it is really comfortable and has lots of friction so no sliding around on my shoulders while i m playing it s plenty long for any guitar size or shoulder width and adjusting is just like most leather straps taylor logo makes it look good and official nothing bad to say about this strap i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic easy to use and very accurate it makes tuning a breeze stopped working all by itself fresh battery didn t help fortunately i ve another plus a korg and an two intellitouch i ve fiddles and guitars the intellitouch is simply champion
53	not that many good products accessories for ukuleles this one is perfect in size and price however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock just give it a little thought overall it s fine i am years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months as you can imagine i need to practice a lot my wife of years does not enjoy my practicing especially when i practice monotonous scales i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor s web site i love it easy to put on and take off the rubber won t hurt your violin bridge or strings you can barely hear it in the next room you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge my violin s tone doesn t change much at all with this mute now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar the rubber makes it easy to hold onto and i feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well good for any beginner but consultation with a teacher if you have one is recommended for ham fisted persons positioning is not easy for lossening strings proper bridge resetting and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required measuring requires a hard ruler with a full milimeters required bet you don t have one or a technician s measuring tape and confident measuring skill measuring is best with a cooperative assistant bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the d string to hold the bridge position measurement check tightening the a string measurement check removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the st and th strings and tuning the instrument do it you ll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing if you ain t intelligent good luck you d best be served with dot stickers i bought this harmonica for our son the music enthusiast he loves it it seems to be manufactured well as it is substantive in weight and seems to be solidly built only time will tell but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks couldn t pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price our son says it s easy to use and has a good sound quality hey if it makes our son happy so be it highly recommend
54	i love the strings so far just put them on my jasmine by takamine guitar today and they sound amazing very bright tone i will be using d addario strings from now on very pleased with them i use to mount a portable digital recorder onto the side of a mic stand very stable clamp mechanism works very well price is good nice to have in your gadget bag i use to stereo mic my egnater works great nice sound to my ears not much different from an sm and is a fraction of the price it s not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me too noisy for hand held vocals put it a mic stand instead i ve got a couple of these and for the most part i m very satisfied on the mandy absolutely no problems on guitars it sometimes doesn t register on the low e usually moving around helps when you re looking into a quality cable you wouldn t expect to find such quality for this price range the construction is solid well insulated cording and having done some test recording with it i will definitely be purchasing more of these as the studio expands while there may be more expensive cables out there i feel that for the price you are getting something of a higher quality than you would expect didn t notice any defects and no static noise bleed despite being around lots of other audio equipment monitors etc even touring or in a mobile studio application i wouldn t be worried about this cable failing or noise bleed only regret is not picking up a few more at this price but i m sure to order more for future expansion not worried at all about using this cable as part of my signal chain and was relieved to have it shipped out and arrive in a timely manner quality product quality vendor i honestly don t know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too i ve seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more this is a hard shell tolex covered case they are sturdy well padded with plush black lining and look as good as cases costing much more these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them one is for my ibanez ak g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly the case has brass latches and one is lockable and comes with keys it s made in china but isn t most everything these days i wouldn t recommend it for airline railroad baggage but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions i don t think you ll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else don t be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases
55	the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable i did not realized it was double screened until it arrived so it was even better than i had expected as an added bonus one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy i used to buy so for reminiscent s sake i cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording dif you needed a pop filter this will work just as well as the expensive ones and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did buy this product basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion i have big hands which may be part of it i use mediums but bought these for my nephews takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar always love these strings this kid has not changed his strings in years so i thought i would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible this capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument highly recommended just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly i bought my dad one too he loves it too
56	this stand feel sturdy and strong compact design on stand and folding for travel good for acoustic and electric guitars thick non scratch foam is a plus love it i really wanted this to work but it doesn t don t bother it doesn t mute the strings at all one star just for it getting here on time the construction fabric color and padding are all a this is a super bag my precious uku will always be protected and look good too my kids are all interested in learning the uke this one really appealed to my son because of the front design plays well and keeps in tune i ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews i found it to be excellent for the price and so far have had no problems with the zippers this product is described as a soprano ukulele gig bag and that is exactly what it is a gig bag is not a rigid faa approved flight case nor is it a semi rigid polystyrene case with soft covering reviewers that don t believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a gig bag and don t understand the term you wouldn t put your reading glasses in a soft padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you i don t know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag but i found that it fits the soprano size perfectly it is very well padded for a gig bag having extra padding at the base of the instrument where the bottom strap button would be if you have one to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end it also has a nicely padded handle i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well ukulele not included they cost a little more than this best ukulele strings i have found to date and i ve been playing stringed instruments and uku s for quite a while now i like em just recieved my stand it fits the mandolin perfect it also fits my wifes ukelele so i ordered a second one this morning its made very well is compact once its folded up the price was awesome i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment thank you so much i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects i was really surprised to see how well they sounded i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route if you just want to play around a little this uke will do for an item you can t go wrong i used it on a violin to test out some amps at a guitar center it seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone
57	this cable seems like it will last me for a while as it is only being used to connect a di box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do you can t go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick they have a better grip and a more full sound to my ears over the tortex picks i have since went to the jazz picks but these picks are a solid product years ago i used the clayton small teardrop picks i couldn t tell from the picture that these were full size and i didn t check the size in the description i still had a few of the small ones so i used them as templates to cut these down i would have rated them higher if i could have used them as is it s my own fault for not looking at the specifications i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks but found dunlop r mm orange tortex small tear drop guitar picks pack which are a lot cheaper the pedal works as described the draw back is the battery installation you have to take the pedal off to access the battery the other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use i purchased a power supply to go along with it the problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for it s ok for the money and works good i run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound i am looking for i mainly use it with a large body f hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth it is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand i would prefer more tilt but it serves the purpose it s also harder to use your ipad without holding it and having an arm rest very durable and light weight if i had to do it over again i would use a music stand instead someday i may use it on stage it s made in germany so it could be taken into battle i had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk and since it was off to the side made it tuff to watch the level meters this clamp on boom serves the purpose but has a hard time holding the weight of my shure ksm condenser mic i tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it to keep it from sagging very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue i wouldn t recommend this if you re doing a lot of recording but it is sufficient for my home studio
58	is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition this very cool its strong and hard this metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it it is so durable filled with options very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician what i like about these spongy little things besides protecting the internals of the mic is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song you re singing just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated so too can a colorful mic cover and my neighbor kids just love em during our singalongs i used it once will only use it when i m in front of it so that no one takes it it works great when you re using your tablet and i use it for playing pandora when playing in clubs it not djing it s dj sound without the dj no offends dj your job isn t easy but when their isn t a dj this helps remember to have wifi in order to connect to panadora
59	i like the durability of it and the on off switch it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder adapter its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used i haven t tried this through a pa live yet i just bought an helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better shure later on its ok the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can t complain about it not being worth what i paid for it i currently have this on my pedal board along with a digitech mainsqueeze which is less expensive more adjustable and just more versatile would i buy this yes if i didn t try anything else first nuff said its a windscreen this is the first one i have bought but it seems to work how it is supposed to it could be less dense i think idk i have a line vetta ii with a floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects for gigs and in my studio including a wah pedal but sometimes i take my smaller marshall down below to jam with friends i just needed something low priced that would do the job for me in that situation and i ended up with something a lot more when i bought this pedal i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now i really like it and for the price i don t see how you can beat it it seems well made and i think or i hope it will hold up well with normal care i ve only ever used my line floorboard and before that an old crybaby for wah effects before but i ll tell you what i really like about this pedal it s spring loaded so it comes back up by itself it says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah i don t even have to think about whether it s on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways i never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage i also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs the only reason i didn t give it five stars is because there s some sort of semi annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes it only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up so i can avoid it if i try i don t know if it s just mine or is something inherent in this pedal i ll update this review if i ever figure it out i originally wanted the boss dd but after doing a side by side demo i decided that i m not buckethead and don t need a dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then i have the berhinger reverb machine and hellbabe and they do equal if not no they do equal to my boss counterparts especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isn t stock boss i wouldn t take these on the road or anything without or backups but for recording and doing demos behinger is the way to go timed effects wise anyway they are made of plastic after all i use to tune with an antique korg i saw these baby on the road with maroon s james just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect the behringer us is well made the high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused it is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass mode i purchased the us specifically for the detune effect this effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps the effect is particularly dramatic when outputs a b are fed into two different amps giving a nice room filling stereo effect i was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects the pitch shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect about as good as i have heard anywhere when using both outputs it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp this makes the guitar sound huge the harmonist effect is amusing but it has limited uses it won t make you sound like duane allman and dickey betts playing in harmony however it is handy for short solos i tried it in the key of g and got useful results the trem bar would work well in loud uses like metal the flutter effect gives a nice leslie effect sound overall i think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals i have seen several speak ill of it but i m not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal there is quite a learning curve on this gadget but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the device one other observation this is more of a studio effect than a road effect there are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect it would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor i had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments the only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect detune for example while gigging in conclusion i debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect i m glad i finally decided to get it the great sounding detune effect alone makes it worth the price the octave effect from the pitch shifter is a nice bonus the other effects are icing on the cake kudos to behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior awesome patch cables for your pedalboard they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks love planet waves gear
60	i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul it fits perfectly in the case one of the best cases i own and have seen the carpet is awesome also has a pocket in the middle what holds the neck up and can fit a strap and even a pedal very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive gibson case nice cables so far i ve not had any problems with them but haven t put them through a lot of use just yet also have the planet waves custom series cables that work just as well for less money i ll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other for the price this is a pretty nice strap it s thin but does the job well the simulated leather end pieces are noticeably cheap but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet i have a lot of pedals including many delays and echos the mxr is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my aqua puss eh delux memory boy ibanez boss and lets not even get into the behringer stuff i like the chorus like mod button very lush and sweet to listen too not as feature rich as some of my other delays but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me simple to use compact and well built i like using this clean but even it s ability to take some distortion is pretty good this is simliar to my favorite echo the morely ecv from the s in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it lush is the right word hope this helps i liked these a lot for the price they work very well and i am very happy that i bought them i got a couple of those straight coupler things but really their use is quite limited because input jack heights on different effects pedals are rarely the same height so you can t use the straight couplers you don t run into that problem with these they can connect any pedal to any other pedal too much noise with one spot this was way better lot of feature outlets can all be used to power either v or v pedals for each outlet just use the voltage selector switches to choose the voltage you need plug in your pedal and go outlet works the same way and gives you a similar choice except that it s between v and v outlets and may only be used one at a time if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise like outlets outlet gives you a choice between v and v outlet is a v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power isolated outputs delivering ma each centre pin is negative ac output at connector will power all pedals most of my pedals are to ma so potentially i could have plus pedals in a chain awesomeall the cables you needlike all t rex fuel tank power supplies your new chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter free once you ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play excellent don t even think about it just get it highly recommend it
61	good quality guitar cord very low noise repairable effective strain releaf thick rubber cover this is a great buy under bucks for a quality cord of course i just got it it might not be durable but it looks durable if i change my mind about anything i will update my review for now i would say buy one joe nothing special just like every other strap of its kind i compared it to other poly straps i have and it s ok no better and no worse price was good it took a long time to come leather ends seem ok i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint i m using it as a spare so it should be ok i m a little disappointed i m used to a higher quality from eb products it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone i don t perform a lot of antics on stage it s just me and the axe i don t expect any problems hope this helps small thumbs up to amazon i works as advertised what can i say it s inexpensive and does what it s supposed to just buy it and move on i sent this to my grown daughter for her birthday and she has been very pleased with the product i have three tuners myself and i find the korg to be portable easy to use and easy to read battery life appears to be adequate oh and not to forget accurate shipping was faster than advertised a thumbs up for this one amazon comes through again on price and product these picks were a filler item for a much larger order i can always use guitar picks however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel what do you say about a little chip of celluloid well almost everyone i know who plays has a preference in guitar picks these do it for me i like the look and more important i like the feel in my fingers and on the strings they also seem to make a good clean sound i use an ibanez electric and a gibson acoustic as my favorites out of seven guitars maybe it s all in my head but these feel good to me using any of my guitars it does know when your guitar is in tune does it for you so you don t have to do it by ear
62	this product is straight forward and works as it s intended one side note there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings i m not sure if all of them do this but the one i received does it doesn t cause any problem with the product s performance it s just loud the product arrived as in the description but i made the mistake to buy it for my fender squier bullet not a full strat there are differences between this pickup covers and my fender squier first the magnet tips in the squier are closer together i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats second the squier s has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent not the most beautiful thing but worked the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly no moving parts no high tech components the ultimate in low tech it s a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individual s needs enough said these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now i bought this because someone told me they really liked it but it s just not a good product for me anyways i bought this to help disperse some of the weight of my les paul on my shoulder the problem is the thick part of this strap is made too short so if i bring the neck of the guitar up to my shoulder at all the weight of the guitar is now on the skinny part of the strap the leather feels a bit cheap as well you get what you pay for i guess the strap is ok if you play with the guitar in one position yippeee i ll probably have to break down and pay for a real strap tons of useful information on this wheel my only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written seems like reasonably durable construction compact enough to stow it in a guitar case i popped the included battery into place fired it up clipped it to the head of my electric guitar and it worked seamlessly for the price this is a great deal
63	this set of strings is fantastic i ve been playing for over ten years now and have tried everything from elixirs to d addario to martin to john pearse you see where i m going with this and many more i have to say that for the money these strings are in a class of their own when i first started playing i loved the coated strings i wouldn t buy anything but elixirs for years then i got married and money became tight and for a pop a set elixirs wasn t looking as good as they used to so i tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years i finally landed on these earthwoods by ernie ball amazing they are not coated but after a while i got used to that and now actually prefer non coated strings these really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought and the medium light set is just perfect nice size high e string so i don t feel like i m going to snap it when i do a pull off and good bass response all in all a fantastic set of strings that you can t afford not to try and at why wouldn t you give them a shot the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on i am a fan of the slinky guitar strings so i got these for my freetless schecter string bass like they were made for it this is not the greatest product they make but it works quickly and makes the string spread when needed to do so more easily than most the pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me how the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable anyway the pickup sounds very nice and i m happy wanted to hang my guitars on the wall these hooks are padded and rotate a little provides a strong non damaging support for some fine guitars the difficulty in installing was i wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud i had to attach them to a wood board that i attached to the wall this also provided a additiional separation from the wall the guitars are less likely to bang on the wall
64	i needed picks so i ordered an assortment i have been trying different ones i seem to like them all not that many good products accessories for ukuleles this one is perfect in size and price however you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock just give it a little thought overall it s fine i have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole i mainly play an american standard tele and the r fits her like a glove i love the tone and the reverb for is amazing the dirty channe is what it is but the clean channel is worth the price of admission i can imagine using this guy for a small gig but i mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping if you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further this really is a great little amp update if you are interested in a diy amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp check out my review and amp stand plans for the r on my website di bass is the worst just really really awful every ordinary di box i ve tried yields this thin cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light so when i started playing live weekly i just hauled my bass amp around to each gig because it was out of the question that i would rely on a weird sounding di box to carry the day i live in phoenix i made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in degree weather before i decided there had to be another way when i first got this pedal i would run it parallel with the amp terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound after a few performances i let go and left the amp at home the bass attack pedal did not disappoint ever since i just bring a bass and this pedal running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound i don t miss the amp at all i did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived just tweaking knobs until it was perfect you ll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass and some of the settings i tried were less than ideal for my instrument but once i got it locked in i ve never touched the knobs again i just plug in and everything sounds magical item arrived on time and as described item is solid and well designed does not need and installation and setup this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars i ll buy more for the other guitars at my house this is the best clip on tuner out there it s dead accurate doesn t bounce around like dial needle tuners and it s easy to read you just clip it to your headstock either acoustic or electric turn it on position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro there are other tuners by snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges so check out what suits your needs i bought the smaller behringer usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about due to the fact that the usb doesn t provide adequate phantom power for a condenser microphone not properly disclosed by the company the simple setup i have also includes the behringer c condenser microphone and a hosa xlr cable i was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts interviews etc over a simple usb headset without breaking the bank in addition to the positive reviews on amazon about most of the behringer equipment my son who has some experience with sound equipment said that behringer makes solid items but that i shouldn t expect much in the way of customer service he s helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items i bought to be quality as expected i m glad that i moved up to this board even though it has a lot of features that i won t personally use i m glad that this has two microphone inputs if i do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board besides the extra mic input my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in garageband i have found that my son s warning is somewhat correct at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website since this is essentially entry level equipment people like myself who have little no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects particularly in hooking things up to a computer which is obviously an increasing application i couldn t find any information on the behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a mac user for instance in addition it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring etc when using with a computer but they don t i ve done a lot of experimentation in addition to googling to figure out how to get things up and run so far i m getting quality recording results from this board i am currently using it with an rca type cable with the input to my imac s line in i might ultimately try another adapter for a usb connection or firewire but i haven t had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound whether i not i investigate will depend upon my needs in the future i believe i got excellent value in the equipment quality i would give stars but the manufacturer should provide more information
65	if you are considering this guitar i have to assume you re shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end not trying to decide between this and a gibson les paul custom it is in the category of beginner intermediate guitars that i rate this a star instrument i really couldn t find anything wrong with it yes it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive epiphone les pauls such as having only two controls for volume and tone rather than four which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous gibson but you weren t planning to try to fool anyone were you beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway the sound is good and i found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine the pickups are surprisingly good the same electronics are found on some of the more expensive epiphone les pauls it was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good although it would sure be nice if they didn t cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality as for fit and finish reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a monday after a long weekend of partying for several reasons if i had this to do over i would not buy it online nor would i buy it from gc better to inspect the actual guitar you ll be buying and don t be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don t like the first one you see i discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price but they would have included a full professional setup including string change you are likely to find a similar deal where you live because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the internet and gc as it is i took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup it had some intonation problem the action was too high and as others have commented the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately i asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners as i d read a lot of people trashing the tuners bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them he instead assured me that they were fairly decent and advised against changing them unless a problem develops out of the box i was a little unsure of my purchase however now that it s been fully set up and new strings installed i am quite pleased with this guitar i don t believe you will find a better guitar or even close at this price level i did a lot of shopping and considered guitars up to for my first foray into electric i was tempted to go with something more expensive on the theory that in a couple years i ll want to upgrade anyway now i m glad i chose this one for one thing this is a guitar i ll always enjoy having around there is nothing cheap or toy like about it in years my tastes may change i may want something completely different down the road and now i still have that option had i gone with a more expensive model i d feel locked in no good bottom line if you re shopping for a guitar in this price range i think you ll be pleased with this guitar buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you re buying and negotiate to have a setup included because it will almost certainly need one have it set up right install some quality strings and you ll be very happy with the epiphone lp special ii first i have to say the only reason i bought this is that we have two pot belly pigs that live in our house so this was a no brainer to purchase just to have as a fan of pigs and i play the guitar too now for the review this little collector amp turns out to be something i will actually use rather than put on a shelf to look at with all of our other pig stuff i was very surprised how well built it is it s solid as a rock with chrome handles edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control it looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review the ac adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally it also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer now i can take the fender or gibson electrics rather than the acoustic okay i keep getting off topic here the sound is clear and crisp for it s size sure it s not my fender mustang iv but i didn t pay bucks for it either but then my fender doesn t have a pig s snout there are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob but most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway i would compare the sound coming from it as above average but it s the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction for me anyway as for it s size i would say it s just about the size of your average small jewelry box but it s much heavier deceptively heavy but i like that it doesn t have that cheap feel about it like i said i will use this occasionally especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van i look forward to the comments the amp will get i m sure way more than my guitar playing skills as i still have a lot to learn but learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun in summary i would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone who s looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an ac adapter a word to best describe it cool i just put this on my dot hollowbody it s a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job i like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it the price was great had the gibson name on it and was a great value stars i bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it after a month of using those strings i decided to replace them since i was having trouble keeping the low e string in tune i put these strings on and compared to the default strings it was almost silky and softer by comparison i m guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel the sound was much nicer to my ears as well they were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar my son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar it hasn t failed him yet it s easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly he says it s a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings highly recommend this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar my fretboard hasn t been cleaned oiled in years so it was extremely dry the cleaner removed visible grime the polish cloth shined up the frets but most importantly the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel i am very pleased with the product another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier better looks and function tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best i doesn t take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time these are guitar picks and i don t play guitar so i can t say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were d addario are the best strings that i have tried i used to use ernie ball super slinky s but found that these last longer the ernie s bend and play well but they tend to go dull faster not to mention the ernie s start corroding within a week these d addario strings stay brighter longer i usually change them about every weeks the ernie s only last me a week weeks at the most that can get expensive fast all around the d addario strings are the strings me retraction when i originally wrote this review i thought they were the best turns out they are in fact way better than ernie ball strings but they are no longer my preference a friend of mine told me about dr strings and they are much better than these d addarios dr s last three times as long as d addario the dr s cost a lil more but they are way better for the money addarios are good but i would recommend spending a few dollars more for dr strings i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy now if i can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand or to the desk where i sit and play maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument yeah i think a few of these would be nice i had been using s on my s takamine and they were over powering the chassis with vibration the result was poor sound switching to these s made a huge difference in tone it took a bit to get used to the lightness but now i will stick with them on this guitar they are also easy to do bends which i like alot i have never broke a d addario acoustic string these fender pickguard screws are excellent they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment i replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they re much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent not much to screw up good quality parts on an essential product brain dead simple install and no surprises works like a champ i like ernie ball strings they are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands i tried i change strings every two weeks i tried the rest and returned to the best i definitely enjoy these and i highly recommend them they are used by other artists that approve of them slash from guns n roses uses them i am pleased with this guitar strap and feel it will do great for the young musician in our home i love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a yamaha i currently have acoustical yamaha guitars the fg s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar i usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and i can reach the full length of the neck with no problems it has a deep tone and good volume i give stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player these are fantastic and unique guitar picks i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well it s always nice to have a conversation item and these little ones age great to show off to your guy friends love them and they re good quality picks too so i will use them i thought i was buying the footer and realize i ordered the footer too late let s be honest here what good is a foot amp chord unless you re sitting on the amp my bad i never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the footers as it does for the footers i would not recommend buying a footer unless you practice in a closet i bought this one for one of my heavier guitars hoping for some shoulder relief and it does the job it s inexpensive and the padding is excellent it looks like it will last too i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster i am revising my previous review on the l s i have now only had these on my american stratocaster for two weeks i loved them so much at first that i ordered other sets and restrung several of my other strats and other guitars big mistake why am i so impatient these were unbelievable right out of the box bring my strat to life giving it an unbelievable feel and sound but with every positive there s usually a negative and wait for it wait for it yup there was i changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my strat and noticed all three smaller strings g b e were all flat on the fret side they were already worn out i suspected something as the sound had changed already too becoming flat after only about a week this is not mu only guitar i now have total and rotate playing so i bet i hadn t played the strat for more than hours or so now i m so disappointed i m going to step up to the s then the if i have to i love the sound but don t want to change strings every week to make a long story short i wouldn t buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings don t know why quality instruments don t come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement the next time you change your strings check and see if your current nut is plastic if so have a few of these on hand and re place that nut you will hear the difference and they don t wear out like plastic just make certain you get the height correct so your action isn t too high rule of thumb grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height you can always remove more material but you can t put it back on this is a quick easy improvement i have bone on all of my guitars bought these as an extra set just in case i made a mistake when i was trying to cut down my nut and bridge they are real bone and fit well on my yamaha did not end up using them but will one day great product for the price love my assortment of picks and the price was right i like that their is different gauges because i don t always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but i only received instead of picks but whose counting i m still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again thanks this is a modeling amp it has several presets to emulate different sounds they factory settings for these are pretty good and all but the first bank of three can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp if you get the fender fuse software license comes with the amp you can get some pretty amazing pre sets from fender and other users this is not a massive cabinet so you aren t going to get that big a sound regardless but for a small room it s great common complaint i have seen no clean channel preset this is not the case there are a couple of factory presets that are clean although some people want cleaner you can either adjust the gain vol yourself or download one of several very nice very clean presets from the fender forums that said one of my guitars is edgy it wants to overdrive the amp another doesn t and is very clean even on the factory preset clean i very nearly got a different amp i went to a music store and a salesman showed me a mustang ii i was sold when he showed me what all it could do then showed me the price for a mustang i for usd this is about as much as you could possibly ask for it ll keep me busy for a long time
66	it is a string winder what more can i say it works as it should and saves time very useful when restringing a guitar i can t compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder i use i have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar i own and every student i ve ever had has one on their guitar as well they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding they stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time they can be easily removed and relocated after relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location i have had as many as picks stored in one and as few as one pick stored in others no matter how many picks you store or for how long the spring action loader never loses its resistance i highly recommend these i personally will never even try any others as i am so pleased with this product if you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks this is the product for you bought roughly of these i like them and my playing buddy likes them has a sticky bottom if you want to peal off the paper and stick on table etc i keep one in each case enjoy will this replace a pro fret job nah that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth end results i used to buy leather straps but not any more this strap is very nice and comfortable it s also the cheapest one i ever bought can t go wrong these fender locking tuners are the best for stratocaster guitars mainly if you have a tremolo system what helps a lot the tuning stability and speeds up the strings change maybe it s because i cut my musical teeth on motown and s rock but i ve always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound or even ground wound strings it might also have something to do with the fact i play upright as well flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright like to my ears it doesn t hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever too i use d daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as i ve found them to be very consistent from set to set and the sealed plastic packaging means that i can buy a set today put it in my case and it s be as good as new a year later i used to use labella flats on my fretless and then switched to thomastik jazz flats then a friend told me he d switched from the thomastiks to these he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well i m now a convert too the strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set are the perfect balance between weight and confort it fits very well on my guitars fender evh wolfgang ibanez s the cons is that these do not come with vci so expect some flakes when you open the pack nice to get these for ur effects they are great product and does exactly what they supposed to connect ur pedals great cable short and useful also quiet if you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps easy to use and very secure no fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor these seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which i will appreciate for a long while rock on tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy why you would almost think i know what i am doing
67	i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help where the stand shines if micing amps some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease these fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide tree installed on a tele i built much less surface of the string touching very smooth action when using the vibrato took no more than minutes to install reasonably priced super upgrade i recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar these look like rollers but are not rollers they do work well and i will purchase more for other tele s and stratspros well made cons none i can think ofsleek well designedquick installimproved soundinexpensive upgrade this is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar if you don t enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but don t like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar won t slip out of the strap while you re playing then upgrade to this system does a good job polishing my strat after playing reasonably priced definitely something to keep around if you play your guitar regularly looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before i replaced it with this one acquired a strat without a trem and ordered this one it fits perfect and even though i m not a huge whammy user it s nice to have for that occasional vibrato this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill but this is the switch for that amp i purchased a set of fender vintage tremelo tension springs in order to beef up the tremelo tension on an inexpensive squier jagmaster guitar that i recently purchased these springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the jagmaster the loop actually goes all the way around which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar and it seems that they are of a higher tension highly recommended as replacement springs or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars this is a cheap and easy upgrade at about years old my mim standard strats hardware was starting to show her age most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust for about bucks i was able to replace all the screws springs bridge neck plate this is stage one of my rebuild the tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality fold don t forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them my only complaint is that it doesn t seem as accurate as some traditional tuners but that s probably by design so you aren t fiddling over fractions of a semitone when you re trying to tune your guitar between songs sets
68	a couple of bucks more than dunlop which i have not tried i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case but it works fine and is well made arrived on time enjoy this device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone sounds like a s video game beep but i am just being picky i bought this for my son and he loves it i cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp i was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound instead i couldn t put it away i must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe the tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing i would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp the v battery holds up well which is surprising considering the drive you got off it so spend the and get something that is a real deal i hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one i bought this for my sigma dmc e it allows my guitar to hang better than the lasso type headstock straps and looks much better they leather is very high quality and is very supple i have been using olympus vn for recording piano and singing sessions and i want to upgrade it to dr o mkii for stereo and connecting to computer it has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices the sounds is amazing and it is much better than vn and the price is worth to spend i haven t fully utilized it yet and didn t have time to study the menu completely so i just checked the menu whatever i need at this stage so far i am happy for what i got the recording quality from this guy the build is light which is good but its plastic material is kinda cheap as most reviewer commented and the size is bulky and i think it can be shorten as dr too bad i don t need channels yet even though i can use it for guitar practices and session ended up i picked dr mkii for slightly less bought it for my x mas gift and got a promotion of rebate at that time i mailed whatever is needed for the rebate to the vendor for almost weeks but i still haven t gotten any notice from the vendor besides that the vendor requests to cut the bar code label from the original box with a filled form for the rebate which make me dislike if they don t rebate to me and i can t return it neither since the original was cut trashed feel like it s a tricky rebate
69	as a beginner playing guitar i was looking for something mid range and this is it it holds tune and has not failed yet since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice as i get better i will upgrade so far the only maintenance has been to tune it and clean the strings and that is normal this unit is like a old blue jeans problaly exist betters pedals but it s produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything i have to say i was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but i was shocked at the sounds i could get it took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone i wanted and off we went for the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone is worth twice as much as far as durability i have had in a month used it times so far so good i did purchase the protection plan for so i m covered for years simply a nice assortment of picks to try worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make
70	i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar i would have thought pledge would work but after a little reading i found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use it also comes with a nice polishing cloth great deal for the money probably the best capo i have ever had it s easy to put on and holds the strings well although you always need to check the tuning after putting any capo on a guitar this one seems not to upset the tuning too much i m impressed wow this is the pedal to own there are a lot of good pedals out there but this one has that original bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from s quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps just amazing if you don t have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine a great purchase and built like a tank this light is exactly what i needed very bright and great battery life and it comes with power cord unlike some others where the cord is more we are an acoustic duo and play out on a lot of decks at bars and restaurants and this is perfect lights the music book nicely a definite must have these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too
71	i bought this capo for mywashburn d it works on my orlando classical guitar as well i wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn t too expensive and the kyser quick change guitar capo fits the bill nicely update my orlando guitar was stolen boo hoo easy on easy offthe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off rubberized clampsrubberized clamps helps prevent the kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets ergonomicthe arched arm with the weird looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the kyser capo durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum update i ve had this capo for almost years and it s still working like a champ according to amazon s instant order update for moi i got this capo on november the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video it s the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent i don t think you can go wrong with this one like all gibson products this is high quality polish that one would use on a high quality guitar i have used gibson polishes for years i started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in december of and continue to do so to this very day he absolutely swears by them he does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in hawaii makes them prone to rusting other than that the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there scratch free durable machine washable i use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much much longer you place the cloth next to a string then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces sides and top of the string then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times then repeat on the remaining strings i then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys takes a matter of moments and works great then once every week or two it just goes in with the laundry comes out perfectly clean again polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric it is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface but it works well for polishing if i m using carnuba wax i use a cotton towel to remove it but for dry polishing wouldn t be without one for each guitar ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound i m so proud of my balls i bought a pedaltrain pedal board and i have individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it i originally bought hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile but the selection of lengths is limited i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re do the board i swear i was done in minutes the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality the supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small tip flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step i could have saved some money if i had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables this one is probably closer to a guitar the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it s just like most of the other made in china guitar from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only but i m not at all impressed one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis which usually means they re a jack of all trades but a master of none i recently bought a johnson jg n a johnson jg n a bristol bd a jasmine s and this yamaha if i d only played the yamaha i d probably think it was a pretty nice guitar but having tried all of these side by side i can definitely say it s not at all amazing the bristol blows this thing out of the water and not just because it s cheaper it plays and sounds better the johnson guitars both have a little higher action not a lot of highs and a cheaper fit and finish the jasmine is nice but i haven t spent enough time playing it to give a true review the yamaha fg gs is definitely neat to look at and has decent mids but doesn t really have a great high to low end punch now it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body but the sound range overall wasn t great the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison also the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same can t help but think that the reviews here are a bit hive mind where everybody buys into a hype maybe i got a dud guitar but i doubt it they re all made in the same factory if was looking to get my amps off the flood i have w amps and a big fender dsp i am using this for my amps it works very well i recommend them to do the job for the i am not sure i would use them for a sunn v x cabinet i d say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection i don t use them all too often because they re a bit too stiff though just use a smartphone to record stuff this is a really weird not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones not really worth the i returned mine
72	i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive taylor ships this guitar with these strings and for a good reason they sound wonderful right out of the box like with most all string guitars lights or extra lights are most often appropriate the feel of these nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate in tandum with the instrument bring out it s best resonance and sustainability give em a try i bought this to restore the neck of an ibanez that i had ordered used and knew needed tlc after a few coats of this stuff the neck looked played felt like it was just out of the factory it restored years of neglect in just a few minutes when i bought this i though it wouldn t be enough boy was i wrong i ll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because i can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come if your going to use on amp get some two sided velcro and stick on amp or two sided tape etc for price its fine amazon is the best
73	this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price it s lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes the biggest drawback is that the one i received required the action to be adjusted the bridge needed lowered slightly and the nut held the strings way too high above the frets the result was very sore fingers these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools otherwise you ll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup stock strings have a warm tone excellent steel guitar strings each string has a color coded end each string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where purchased a set box and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness i went with the mediums try the light if you are a beginner overall dimensions x x very nice travel size sound is about what you would expect it is basically a toy if you use more than of max gain it sounds awful i turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies i am using it with a fender starcaster when i travel for work hotel friendly i think it s over priced but i think it looks good and it seems durable i probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are oem and fit perfectly recommended cheap stands get the job done i have problems so far i ve taken them from new jersey to south carolina
74	mics are like pants you have to find the right fit this one i like for my vocals live i sing fairly low and airy works great for me also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live very sweet sound i prefer it to the seems a bit more bright and natural might purchase another one eventually i recently sent two of my ovations back to the factory in connecticut for re work i just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them as soon as i took them out of their case and strummed them i immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings i ve ever played what exactly are they i might experiment with the exp s but by and large these exps are my new strings this instrument might actually be in a class of its own that is it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality not only with regard to craftsmanship but certainly the sound it produces the applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged amplified or even run directly through a mixer beyond sounding comparatively spectacular it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design the electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible or playable to even the most novice of musicians this guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician simply because it is cost efficient durable and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic a great addition and will serve me well it works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes it is easy to use easy to put on easy to adjust the tension and lightweight when not in use i keep it parked on the headstock the shape and ergonomics are a mix between a kyser and a schubb s five stars all the way highly recommended
75	this cable seems like it will last me for a while as it is only being used to connect a di box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar they are even and not warped like the stock ones were it s the tube screamer of delay pedals i use mine primarily to thicken up my tone and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board i have used it for situations that call for deep delay and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey i fall back on a ehx memory man chained to an anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the delays in experimentation sequences but when playing blues or thrash i use it as tone beef only low settings not too echo ey more like a bass d out reverb there are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal and it is a testament to it s versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres hey stop reading this and order it now this is a super easy to use pedal you just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset don t worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound if you really want to be able to tweak everything then get the mxr analog chorus instead it has about six knobs i like the ease of use on this one and i omly use chorus sparingly another cool feature of mxr pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot
76	base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won t topple over but an arm on it and that could be a different story the action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about while i appreciate the weight of the base i do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle works good nothing special i have to say i disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell my big nose can t confirm that maybe they corrected the problem if one exited while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm threading but it does not so if you re threading matches the ksm look elsewhere if you are have problems knowing what and where your systems are terminating theses are a must for you i have mastched them with my microphones and it is easy for controlling and identifying the compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons school or a gig works well
77	i love it i used this for my yamaha ypt and it works great i would recommend it to anyone i have quite a few guitars and i like to keep them clean and polished this stuff is great for my fretboard and i use it every time i change the strings i almost always use ernie ball strings on my electric guitars i ve been using them for years and never have been let down by the quality and sound i didn t need anything high dollar so this was just what i needed does have a cheaper feel than the other much more expensive units i ve used dunlop always makes top notch products so when it came time to find a slide i knew where to look this one produces a great tone and is well made like the other reviewers mention here you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits for general home use though i wouldn t worry about it too much though not quite as loaded as the red all instrument snark but it gets the job done is very sensitive to vibration
78	the thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one no pun intended you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice i ve used many different types of picks over the years and i ve not found the ideal one for me until recently when i decided to use a silverpick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which i find fits my needs the best and so far it s just a case of getting used to it this particular dunlop pick is as described being fat stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face the hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard this makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing for me though i ll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it s not my default or preferred choice for play they are half the size of a regular pick bit too thick for me sound nice will last forever wish i had sized them before i bought them i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel these strings are what i needed and they perform d addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar so far i really like these the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light medium the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out i doubt i will lose them
79	the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at yes does it work well if you can securely close the little gap between the at and the shock mount then yes there is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the at only other thing is that the colors don t really match up well but i don t really care its a good shock mount ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one i don t really use mine since i have carpet on the floors that doesn t like the mic stand shake too much be careful i have a small recording studio so we put our cables through a lot and these guys just don t last they were fine for the first few months but then they started to die like a murder mystery seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot thankfully it was just these cables not good spend a little extra on another brand these have been my favorite gls audio ft cable cords this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm s it s quite a bit stronger of a microphone also i am really impressed with this mic the only thing i d like to see is that it would come with a cover bag like the shure mics do other than that you save a heck of a lot of money for the same and even better quality thanks a lot no matter how many times i hard reset my gs no success there is no problem with my jack and the phone is in pristine condition no problems until now there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work but that s about it i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box i tested the irig with an iphone and was able to get it operating i am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend s iphone but for my purposes with a gs it is a brick if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation i will re rate the product purchased this and a comparable hosa cable this cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling i will stick to gls products from this point forward
80	its a tight fitting case i am a proud owner of aepiphone les paul custom proand it fits as snug as can be when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic i am sure i received a new case being perfectly protected as it was it hadn t a mark on it so as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means it looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job to protect the guitar my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit with this said over time there is a possibility of wear i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail and then handle doesn t look as durable as it could be we ll see on that overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul i saw the gibson case and i just don t see them as superior enough to justify paying more i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be five stars for now i will edit in the future if necessary i had read lots of reviews about behringer some people had buzz and noises etc but this is not my case i m not a professional and i just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar pedal my tascam dr my mobile as sometimes i use the tascam to record the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected great product for entry level and great price for what you get nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun
81	i have an older version of this model but it works great i opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that i got from home depot hangers rated to hold up to lbs each equals lbs worth of peace of mind the hanger itself that i bought was used so it was already assembled so i can t comment too much on the assembly process i bought of them and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry free security and no i don t own stock in the company my advice spend more and get something that will work with all applications cheap midi may get you there but if not you have to buy another yep always the gamble this a great instrument cable if all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one the fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of regular cables i brought this for my husband drum set he loves it it is made very nice i am happy
82	this amp plug is great for the price its ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price my title says it all i didn t like the ac adaptor i did work very well and was strong i liked how solid it was these headphones are wonderful to wear they sound great but that s not enough now a days with the head band being connected to the outside of the muff they fit your head so wide the pioneer hdj has the look read my review on those though they are terrible at first glance these things are serious pro grade they are made of very durable components both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head the head band isn t bad it s a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued not really a big concern though they have a long cord and i ll talk more about it later it ends with a spin on in or a standard mm the sound out of these things is pristine it s not muddy and very clear they have a good amount of bass because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don t leak noise like a lot of headphones do pros heavy duty awesome sound comfortable headband over ear design not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag always clear never muddy even at high volumes very clear left and right ear markings spin on plugcons heavy coil cord heavy weight never got annoying though looks can t say much more than the description it s a cheap box that works nothing fancy and not for everyone if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
83	yes i think you should try these if you re looking at them then get them they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w o any pick experience i don t drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w o looking this is a great guitar for the money i paid for my guitar and bought it through amazon com from streamline audio video it arrived ahead of schedule in great shape ready to play right out of the box after tuning it of course if you want a better guitar than this you will need to spend a whole lot more the sound is great and it is easy to play only about long and may weigh a bit over the lbs stated in the description my strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what i will need it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks it does exactly what it says it does its also very cheap excellent strings beautiful solid tone and no buzzing it sorta cleans strings but not fully i dont even really use it anymore i feel like i wasted my money on this item one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune with this little gadget there is no guess work clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon
84	these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough mic great for all your needs i highly recommend them the thing is that they don t seem to stay i mean you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic arm but it doesn t stay where you put it and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality but i think if you re lucky if just might get the job done
85	i was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i m glad with hosa quality it feels reliable and without adding noise so i bought these because being dunlop i trust the brand i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky the only problem i have is they scare the piss out of me its not a tighten washer and nut situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks these have pegs that insert its so hard for me to trust these i always have hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp i clench my guitar so scared that the little metal balls things will just slip peg fall out and ruin a guitar i havnet had a single problem with this system yet and i never hope that i do but if it happens there will be an update to this good product so far just wouldn t recommend it there is too much crap in the world to be worried about strap locks shouldnt be one of those things i got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them i generally use a dunlop m pick but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play this of course can be very annoying especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song these big stubby picks have solved that problem they are easy to hold onto great for leads and because of the way they are shaped don t hang on to the strings like the regular picks do great picks definitely worth the little extra they cost if you are replacing your old butterfly trees you can use the same holesclip and sand off the alignment pins as they are not really needed and justadd another hole to your headstock good trees for the price my new guitar had only the back strap connector you can put out over for a button strap holder but for under bucks i decided on this attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head you now have a quick release strap holder very well made strong happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to highly recommend this product joe i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new this gig bag was just what i needed to carry around a soprano ukelele it has a strap for slinging the instrument over your shoulder when in the gig bag padding and a pocket in the front for your tuner the zipper is strong enough and it was just what i needed to carry around the ukelele to keep it protected while in transit excellent price excellent tuner with one flaw using it couldn t be simpler and it has excellent contrast i would say it was the best clip on tuner i ve had a chance to use except that it broke the first time i carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal one of the little fingers that holds the ball in the socket on the back of the tuner broke off so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces this model works only by vibration unlike the red one so without the clip it is not very useful it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it but it isn t very convenient i would just super glue it together at a good angle but i have to put it in different positions on different instruments i ve seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem so i would call it a design weakness despite the negatives i would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case update added back a star i m still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results i recently purchased a replacement the sn b but found it really disappointing so much so i may send it back i also tried a planet waves mini headstock tuner which no matter how much i try i simply cannot love so i just ordered another one of these despite the ball socket issue it is still one of the best tuners i ve ever used for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand
86	i ve been using a one spot to power a gator small pedalboard for about years now in that time i ve done probably over gigs and i ve never had a problem is it super quiet no but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups there will be noise it s a fact of life i ve never found it to be excessive turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you re not playing i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard use them for home recording nothing on the road for that purpose these are made well wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart good quality cable with a good price most of my cables are from planet waves and i ve never had an issue pretty cool knock off of the schaller trem or diaz tremodillo this is my nd or rd joyo pedal and my favorite thus far i don t care for the cheap jacks but you get what you pay for and i can always replace them if they break i work on pedals all the time i ve got a scratchbuilt improved ea trem with two footswitchable speeds and a cheap little danelectro tuna melt other than the crummy bypass and plastic construction the tuna melt is my favorite since it has the hard soft switch the improved ea has a great preamp for guaranteed unity gain or more and the footswitchable speeds that i added gives it extra flexibility but i think the joyo trumps it by just a little bit in that the core trem sound is a nice blend of the tuna melt s hard and soft settings so part of this is really a subjective take on this flavor of trem but suffice it to say if you ve tried a few this one will probably satisfy you at least a bit no unity gain issues and the speed and depth have a good sweep throughout their ranges and it s just a niggle but how hard would it be to get the word tremolo silkscreened so that it s centered on the box at least there s no skull and flames like on the high gain distortion the joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only so why not the first thing i learned about this pedal is it does what it s suppose to do but with some drawbacks there is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal if you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you d be up the creek although it is a fuzz pedal is it does fuzz things then that s why i give it stars i deduct star because the loud feedback but in the long run i would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative
87	this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar i sing worship praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely i don t think it is the same as an sm but it is exactly what i need built to last and it is a shure i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive update the very latest vic firth phones have a much improved headband and less bulky earcups while i now prefer the latest direct sound ex s a vast improvement over my original ds cans mentioned below the firth s are still very good and as a bonus cost half as much i still use both brands please remember to carefully monitor your slp volume level with any isolation phones without background noise for reference one can easily play them too loudly which in turn can lead to hearing loss over time update i now own three pairs of vic firth isolation headphones and i m happy to report the original pair is still going strong meanwhile my office setup now consists of two art tube mp units carefully adjusted to add little no volume to the signal path unity gain as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a behringer u control uca dac and a small behringer eurorack ub mixer to provide silky smooth state of the art amplification for the vic firth isolation headphones the resulting sound is absolutely top drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price about total i paid for the entire system affordable technology in the service of great art update these bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time i now own two pairs of vic firth headphones the newest pair live in my gym bag both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble e g getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat bonus tip because these are full sized headphones with large ear cups i frequently use them in conjunction with the new hearos high fidelity full audio spectrum ear plugs lt the combo works in much the same the way dolby noise reduction does i play my mp player or other signal source decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate decibels leaving me with the same music and way less background noise this stuff may not fit your head ears as well as it fits mine but you might try it if you re so inclined original review how does an adhd adult maintain focus in a busy high tech work environment soothing music is part of the fix active noise canceling headphones i ve tried and replaced several but they either sound badly are prone to electrical mechanical problems or both what to do vic firth and direct sound have effective and durable answers isolation headphones i own and use them both the direct sound phones block a bit more noise the vic firth are more comfortable for extended wearing both have excellent sound quality enjoy this capo helps make aesome music thankful for it i like using it for all kinds of palying like at the beach it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt i don t use it for feedback i use it to protect it from the dust it fits tight but it s fine my first reaction on opening the box that this came in was gee it s a lot smaller than i expected it looks like a cad equitek e s but it s a fraction of the size i d even say it was cute but how does it perform i have two microphones i use for recording at my computer a blue yeti usb electret mic and a sampson samtr a of the two the yeti is closer in design as it uses an electret capsule and a built in usb interface like the go mic so that s what i compared it to i fired up garage band and plugged both microphones into the computer a four year old imac so i could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks with acoustic guitar ukulele and double bass right off the bat i was impressed with the go mic s lack of latency it was as good as the yeti maybe better there was no perceptible delay no need to find a special driver either plug it in and it s ready to go there s even a headphone jack in the mic something unusual in a package this tiny sound was good too though perhaps not as uncolored as the yeti i tried all three modes carodid carodid bd pad and omni omni gave the best clearest sound not unexpectedly but it was hard to get a good level when close miking no matter how i backed down the volume in garage band i got clipping using the db pad i was able to get some acceptable levels from a few feet away best sound on all instruments was obtained from feet using the omni mode it has one advantage over the yeti it s very modest in current requirements so i can run it directly off my ipad the two together make a nice portable recording production combination packaging is well thought out too the mic is permanently attached via a swivel to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection and if that s not enough there s a separate case to keep dust and dirt out of the mic while the go mic wouldn t be my first choice for recording music it would be a very acceptable one for recording musical ideas on the go and perfectly acceptable for voice recording podcasting or skyping love these guitar stands sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price you will pay up to x more for similar stands great bargain not much to say about a plain leather strap except that it s what i wanted and serves me well with the fender guitar it s strapped to this will last a very long time due its sturdy construction two pieces easy to set up in seconds great buy for the only mine was a hamilton
88	i ve been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade they re sturdy and convenient and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap the ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage or when you don t need the strap hanging from your guitar e g sitting in a chair works exactly as advertised i ve purchased several of these and can t say enough good things about the product and company i am a professional touring and recording artist omeb who typically sings through a beta i have recently been very impressed with some of behringer s products sometimes i will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one at i figured i could chance it i used this in place of my beta at a recent show the mic was much hotter than the better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies as far as durability that is the question but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn t cost bucks this is your mic as i am one of those forever beginners when it comes to playing a guitar i may not be able to tell you all that this capo does the reason i ordered it is to hold my strings so i can set my guitar i may play around with it to see what all it does good price just as described i purchased this tuner for my year old who is beginning guitar and it is accurate and very easy to use his guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use i strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner he connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp if you are a beginner or seasoned player i know you will like an appreciate the tuner a must to keep in your bag especially for beginners a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on this little snark is easy to carry around and works great i have used several different styles and brands this is a must have for musicians it does the job easy to get on and off seems to be sturdy and well built best of all the price
89	if you perform at gigs you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue this is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations i used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasn t really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around this stand does the trick beautifully nice job fender this is not my first planet waves locking strap they have never failed though the selection of colors and widths are very very limited it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks but for me these work just fine highly recommended well conceived spring loaded slot holes multiple picks it is small and can be affixed self adhering to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play inexpensive solution and quite handy the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well i have not had them very long but seem to do well my old one lasted a long while and it still works just wanted another one these tuners are just awesome looks better than the expansive one my grandson has he keeps using mine arrived early and is of great quality fits my very old acoustic just right
90	these fit snug on my shure sm beta a mics nice texture and it doesn t affect the sound of my mics i recommend em bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot great quality for the money and works well mic is as described so far so good and i know if anything goes wrong i just have to return it to a local dealer well worth the investment first time i ve spent over bucks for headphones use for both reference with a gnx and guitar and easy listening very accurate and no coloration of tone that i can detect semi audiophile a bit bass heavy but overall great headphones very comfortable get hot to wear in the summer purchased to provide professional level i o for recording from mixers etc works very well for that purpose also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone s the bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book inputs provide for microphone phantom powered or not instrument balanced line on trs and balanced line on xlr connector tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed and dead silent output of high quality material also sounds superb and compares well with other very high quality gear everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this crowded price point though lacking lots of the i o and routing options you get with more expensive units this device unlike most other products in this price range has a quality feel to its enclosure jacks and controls drives headphones even inefficient ones to satisfying levels cleanly the input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too hot the color changes briefly to red helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering in sw to adjust your levels re computers and drivers almost all the tests went well on two laptops running windows installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great one of these recorded perfectly also the other which has a core duo processor fwiw had issues recording properly and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed and i tried them all this problem remained so for certain windows laptops you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout this issue is why four starts rather than five on a happier note this interface instantly worked with absolutely no installation on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio precise so for linux users this may be a very attractive option lastly documentation and bundled software is light this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear guidance re best practices etc but this is a nit overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily
91	this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand it is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing only thing make sure you read the description well it is a euro stand so it has threads it does not come with a mic clip when i ordered my mic from behringer their clip had standard threads which obviously would not attach i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going overall i would buy again this is a good budget uke i m not a ukulele expert to me they all sound a little toyish this one has better tone and projection than some of the ones i ve played in stores i haven t tested it with scientific instruments or anything but i have a good ear former professional tuba player current music teacher enthusiastic amateur guitarist and the chords sound nice and in tune to me the tuners are cheap but they are geared which is nice and it stays in tune decently it s not the stradivarius of ukuleles the finish is pretty bland and the sound is not exactly a revolution i have used it to teach a class for teachers on using music in their classrooms and it performed well my experience with offshore budget instruments leads me to believe that quality control may be spotty but i only have the one and it is good it is neck heavy but they all are in my experience and it seems pretty sturdy although i ve been very gentle with it unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin can t yet get the sound out of a violin that i want with it but still experimenting will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it s connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise all in all very well spent thank goodness pickup prices are coming down only a few years ago you could not find a pickup mic even this good for now if only the price of pickup chics would come down i bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program i m a teacher not a student i have only used it with garage band but it works really well i have used it to record electronic drums bass guitar direct out from a multi effects pedal vocals and guitar with garage band s virtual amps i ve been very impressed if you really turn up the gain you will start to get a lot of noise but the noise comes well after you get past the point that any reasonable signal is clipping making the light turn red so with the gain at or so of the way up you get good clean signal with little to no noise the cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short i bought of the same ziotek extension cable at the recommendation of focusrite one worked the other didn t so yeah best of luck with that focusrite should really have made a longer cable it gets in the way of the usb power plug a little bit and makes things awkward other than that i like it a lot
92	this is a really solid table mic stand and you re not going to find a better price i looked the base is solid and heavy and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube i liked the first one enough that i ordered a second i should note though that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips which i can imagine being disappointing even though it didn t affect me this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect very cheap and great for price but recording with this isn t the best idea good for live performance on a budget this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows smooth midrange and crisp highs for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production the sound is unbelievable especially at this price for under twenty dollars this pyle pro mike can t be beat one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam dr portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device the tascam d is known for this noise issue but usually not when using the xlr input so i have these old ev mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled these provided an easy inexpensive solution no complaints
93	i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost for the price i paid for this guitar i will be money ahead in two visits to my parents i had it shipped to my parents when i bought it and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits it has much better tone than i expected and very good action stays in tune very well i am very happy with my purchase recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party far as i can tell good strings they do the job and they feel great not much to say i got exactly what i expected great heavy picks amazingly cheap price you really can t go wrong i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry and this has been great to have an endless supply at first i was skeptical of this nifty little tuner but since i ve been using it for the past few weeks i ve yet to have one complaint it sits right atop clipped to the guitar operates on vibrations so doesn t pic up other guitars is light barely even notice it and seems quite accurate
94	what can i say it s a cable it s cheap and it works as advertised much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops gold tips yeah right this multi plug works great and has enough plugs for pedals i only needed it for two pedals which are not in a case so there is some extra plugs hanging on the floor but is better than setting up another wall wart each pedal if needed in the future i have these extra plugs i recommend this multi plug to everyone the cable hisses crackles and pops right out of the package save your money and buy a better cable i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far i have only used it a couple of times but the cable works it is what i expected it to be i got this as a gift for the my guitar mentor and lead guitar player in my band i have a tuner built in to my amp i use but he has always tuned by ear which is hard to do on stage or even at rehearsal the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it this a great cable for practicing at home coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles this product measures approx coiled plug end to plug end thus it is pretty short even when stretched out for me it is the perfect length for at home use especially when using two amp pedal board guitar not sure why it isnt available for order on amazon anymore i just ordered mine two weeks ago best recorder for the money i ve seen easy to use easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings the nearest competitor to this is slightly slimmer witch to me would not be a plus because i don t use this on a camera rig the picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is check out the youtube vids on it i believe it to be more versatile than its competition and the build quality is higher as well the only thing the other has on this one is its size
95	i don t know if this is a common problem but i have these on both of my basses and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing like metal does before it rusts it is literally only one of the arms out of i have so i think it was just a random thing the problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn t just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose and one time the first time i didn t notice and it actually fell out notice i still like the product this was just one of those things i think so i would still recommend it quality is there in construction and signal passing we never have problems with our monster gold cables conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically i like the wide for my bass fits nice and made well seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick
96	i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe great picks nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style i would recommend these for any guitar player i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic easy to use and very accurate it makes tuning a breeze sounds pretty good great for the price new to guitars but in hrs it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings easy to play decent quality not expensive easy to bend plastic comb with no recess this is the lowest level you d want to really play the harmonica and it won t break the bank
97	i have a solid non weight relief les paul traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me like these better then the bulkier dunlops this tremolo arm needed to be bent outwards a bit in order for it screw down enough while still clearing the volume and tone controls overall a pretty good purchase i found that these were ok but the heads were bigger than i could stand to use on my cramped for space pedal board so they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and i m glad i did this is one lush pedal and it s all analog this pedal also sounds great with gain
98	i ve got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years this stuff cleaned most of them out pretty well but my midrange pot is starting to crackle again i hate to tear the chassis out again but it d gotta happen thee only flatwound strings i ve tried that sound significantly better than these are the thomastiks which cost twice as much and they re not twice as good maybe if i was a working pro i d buy the thomastiks but for me the d addarios sound good and last a long time if you ve never played flatwounds you might be surprised to discover that they far outlast round wound strings that s because what kills the sound of strings is gunk from your fingers and the air getting in between the windings and damping the vibration back when guitar strings were more a lot more expensive it wasn t that unusual to remove strings boil them and put them back on some electric bassists still do this with flats the gunk doesn t get in between the wraps and if you don t break a string you can play a set for months i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from s my fenders to my archtop rockers playing s and s might be intimidated by s but they re not that much harder to play and after a little practice it s easy jazzers seldom if ever play six string bar chords or bend strings which means you just don t need that much muscle anyway flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action they don t vibrate as widely as roundwounds so they don t need as much clearance if you re looking for that classic electric jazz guitar sound flats are the way to go and the d addarios are as good as you need rockers looking for that s sound might try the d addario flatwound s almost the same sound as the pyramids and a lot cheaper i play a cordoba classical and these strings are the best i ve found for it the bass strings really resound all strings stretch and hold within three days and they last longer than i ve expected for classical strings i ve not yet had a broken string with them i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use however it broke not too long after i bought it one of the connections broke that is i think they might have made it a little more durable since then moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool it would be nice though not to have had to do that
99	only complaint is the size which is my fault if you can buy at least a foot if you plan to use it on stage i already had the nickel finished version which i paid a few dollars more for and wanted a spare i like the dunlop design and price it should last a lifetime glad i got it this one is finished nicer than the nickel finish one i have which is rough looking in comparison the black dunlop has a nice smooth finish these strings aren t for everyone and probably not what you want for everyday normal playing but if you re looking for a fast playing string with a bright sound this is the string in addition to putting them on my guitar i also have a six string banjo guitar tuning and just couldn t get the sound i wanted from regular guitar strings light guage nickel strings were recommended to me and they were exactly what i was looking for they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming i play a lot of bluegrass and irish music and i feel these strings are ideal for that purpose i use a lot of d addario strings on my various instruments and i think they offer the most bang for the buck in terms of quality and tone you can pay more but i don t think you get that much more although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new i m sick of protools and i wanted to find something cheap and easy until i could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase this unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so i went for it i m using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick the problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input i ve tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn t external to the unit i even tested the exact same mic cable input into my mbox with protools and got a clean recording i actually like this unit s tone better than the mbox it seems more transparent if not for the hum it would get stars unfortunately hum is a pretty big problem the hum isn t loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks if you start layering though you can quickly be overtaken by white noise i even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem so it works for rough stuff for your own use but i wouldn t use it for anything you plan on passing around much i personally own two of these snarks and i ve seen several others among my friends they re great easy to read and easy to use tuners that are surprisingly cheap however half of the snarks i ve come into contact with have broken within a few weeks one of mine broke after about weeks of very light usage the screen is super faint it s still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting this also happened to two of my friend s snarks my other snark is still going strong i d still recommend them for non critical applications just for the price and ease of use however these definitely aren t reliable gig worthy tuners they re just so cheap it s easy to buy multiple snarks and cover all of your guitars
100	i bought this amp to replace a squier sp that came with my guitar the squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button i couldn t afford a bunch of pedals but i wanted some effects so i could get cool sounds from my electric guitar i saw the reviews for this little amp on amazon and decided to give it a try it is awesome for such a small amp the output is plenty loud for practicing at home and it runs on batteries too so i can take it anywhere the effects are better than i d hoped for this is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer but for an intermediate level guitarist like me who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family this is the amp to get it has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus flanger phaser or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay i m one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that i have the time i don t need the deafening stacks that the kids like i love this amp stripped down one of my basses at the weekend found this very useful made stripping and replacing strings really easy large enough to fit the fender tuners have new sets of strings on order so fitting them won t be as daunting a task as without this item i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape i guess this kit works okay but it s hard to use it will probably last my entire lifetime i think a smaller kit would have been better you really need to remove the strings when you use it so you have to take off all the strings i usually only replace one string at a time when i am changing strings so i had to change my habits if you have a guitar without a truss rod that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you re done changing the strings since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned i m no expert but i have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent however since i love my guitar i use it anyway i picked up another one of these for a new guitar and i m very impressed they ve upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one i purchased a few years ago excellent stand i hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it s really sturdy i can t say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that s the point i ll use a stand if i m going to use a guitar often i had a lb drummer fall into the wall where i had these baby s hung up and not one fell or almost fell
101	these are my go to acoustic strings they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity i bought elixir nanos to compare and i did like them but i think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these i ll be sticking with these for the long run i have tried several different brands types of tuners in my years of playing i have found that this model fits my needs perfectly it quickly detects the tune dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs and is extremely accurate it also has options to tune flat sharp guitar bass etc it is also small and portable i have one in each of my guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pockets pouches perfectly i cant recommend this tuner enough as always please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin i bought this to replace another adapter that came with the yamaha keyboard i bought at costco long time ago the original adapter was bulky and heavy and that s what caused the wires inside to break tried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together but after short use the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apart when it is big and heavy when you unplug it sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapter but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip this new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and size it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in btw i am using this not on the cp series it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too my cp has this identical adapter which i tested on the other cheap keyboard before i bought it it s great and shipping was fast its a little stiff and i m sure it will soften up upon more use cant beat the price i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long
102	it functions as designed it saves time when restringing a guitar it s made pretty well for a plastic tool definitely takes less space than a wire cutter and a cordless drill to change strings admittedly the cordless drill would be used mostly by luthiers but you get the point i bought my first one from amazon over a month ago and simply fell in love with it it cleans polishes wood metal although for strings i use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc with wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids i even recently bought a nd just because and yes the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use i knew it was time when it wasn t wiping off the smudges as quickly it came out with a slightly nappy texture to be expected really but still works as well as ever there is a vast amount of different polish cloth brands out there but you won t go wrong with this one so while i got this for my soprano ukulele they fit fine not much to say really other then they are good strings and work so far still made in america i have been using formula guitar polish for over years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal i ve polished many guitars multiple times this gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new it works great on acoustic and electric solid or hollow body acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings i haven t needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth shines nice and doesn t leave it feeling oily sticky smells nice and makes your guitar looking new bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase
103	unless you re going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords these will do for any medium sized venue i buy dunlop locks pedals straps they all are top quality and i love them all you need a strap strap locks or pedals buy dunlop possibly the best quality mic cable i have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear for the working musician or home recording man this is great extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over southern california and the nation as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere i hate buying them because i know they are somewhere in my house but i just can t find them with this i take all my old credit cards student id cards playing cards etc and make my own i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me it rocks pun intended bottom line every guitarist should have one no excuses as a musician i m in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner i got the package of two unfortunately the first one died a quick and sudden death a new battery didn t resurrect it i couldn t find the other one because they re small and black i finally did find it and have used it several weeks on my guild acoustic and it works nicely so far in fact it works really nice if you are concerned about stage appearance this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig a plus because it s pretty small but big enough to read at the cheap price it wasn t worth my time to try returning the first one i just decided to eat the loss i m crossing my fingers hoping this one will last if you are playing a really nice collectible guitar be cautious because these tuners and capos too can damage the finish permanently i use a tuner on my gibson johnny smith while i play but always take it off when i m done playing this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics my amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up the read out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by red is wayyy off yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune great for a quick look in between songs highly recommended
104	came on time work great for my needs geart for set ups and take downs does lengthen the strap a bit but works this is not my first planet waves locking strap they have never failed though the selection of colors and widths are very very limited it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks but for me these work just fine highly recommended this pedal is terrific it is not a pedal to make you sound like an ac the name is somewhat misleading although you can certainly eq your sound in that direction the real treat is the huge variety of boost tone and gain you can dial in its mindbending the gain is superb not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer this pedal is an audio swiss army knife i like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments i run this through a furman pedal board and there is little to no noise for the money this is a good product
105	pros they look very nice they cause much less wear than the nd hand rack screws and washers cons more expensive and i had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship i d purchase these again but i now have but only need at the most once my rack is filled gls cables are quality cables at a good price i suppose you could spend more and still be happy but why not spend less if it works as well then spend your savings on something else i ve been happy with all of gls products so far i write and record my own music when i upgraded to a new computer with windows it wouldn t support my m audio fast track pro so i had to upgrade the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great very easy to use just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
106	this pick holder is awesome it just snaps on to your mic stand add picks and start rockin it holds the picks securely so if you re performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing even when running on battery power there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs this cable is very well constructed i use it in my dj business and i highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it i am completely blown away with these headphones the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic it does what is supposed to i ts a gate and clamps the noise as good as i expected at the begining i had problems with power some how it didn t power correctly but i was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain so i solved it isolating the mxr connecting it with another power supply and it work so i left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine also check config and the routing of the signal this might influence on how it works i have it right after my wha and before my compressor and it works just fine this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used for direct recording it does if used with an amp maybe but however you use it it is sweet i had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that i almost sent it back but with a little trial and error i figured it out that said this thing is rock solid i was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a ipad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip i have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar this little device gives me auto correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren t overbearing and the pitch correction sounds really natural now i just need more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound
107	perfect size for us big guys i do recommend some snap locks for it though i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness no mud clear mids and highs with clashing mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now love it i installed these pins in my silvertone sd they fit great and are a lot better than the cheap plastic ones that were in it if you have a lower end guitar i highly recommend these pins the saddle will make a bigger difference in sound than the pins but every little bit helps for the cost you can t beat it a little patients sanding the saddle to fit my vintage guild better fit than the plastic original that it replaced and the sound expanded beyond my expectations i also replaced the bridge pins with tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone i like these little guys i m not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price for the money this is a great guitar case i bought it for a silvertone sd which costs about the guitar fits it fine i use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it i don t think i would take it on an airline they destroy luggage so i don t think it would fair well the compartment inside is large enough for picks strings capo and a strap with room to spare mine opens and closes ok and the lock works it is well worth the i paid for it
108	these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs an all around tough mic great for all your needs i highly recommend them these and reds are my favorite acoustic strings these are a little brighter than reds and are best for live playing the strings are well made and i ve never had an issue with quality if you ve never had a pedalboard before i d say pass on this one and look for one that is more user friendly the pics and description don t show just how insanely large this is it s too big patch cables are crap and the power supply didn t seem sturdy enough to be kicked around besides this i had trouble using it even for practice because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals i ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a gator bone and a seperate power supply easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it s own nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume numerous reviews posted on amazon sweetwater sound and musician s friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark this is w mini pa that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully if you have a quality mic there are package sets with this amp by other sellers on amazon that bundle cables and mics et cetera recommend steering away from that and just buying the amp from amazon and getting a shure sm or other quality mic seperately many reviews talk about the durability and how easy the amp is to ding and scratch cosmetically i see potential for that too thus the need for a carry bag mentioned below but i don t see this as a big downer and i personally don t mind if it takes on a road worn appeareance after bumping it a few times if appearance is your thing shell out the extra and buy a roland or fender shop around click around if you buy items sold from amazon you can depend on free shipping if you buy from sellers through amazon you will usually pay shipping and the overall pricetag will be bigger and as i ve stated on other reviews other sellers that sell through amazon sometimes ship slower or make mistakes with shipping so know that going in on your major music retailers sites this baby is going for to got it to my door for i really can t say enough about the ease of shopping trustworthiness and quick delivery of items sold by amazon stars just for service the fact that the amp is awesome makes it that much better you probably won t be able to find a carry case that fits this amp but i bought the singer black universal sewing machine tote for just over and it s perfect it fits the mini snugly with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals with my current setup i can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands and that s really neat the closest amp case would be x combo case that won t fit right and would take away from the whole portability thing you re not going to find lbs and worth of quality amp anywhere else when compared to other makers fender roland nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets and i understand why recommend without hesitation and as with all my reviews if something goes wrong down the road i ll edit the review to share but i expect that this amp will meet my needs for a long time to come
109	i was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i m glad with hosa quality it feels reliable and without adding noise i love this pedal that said i would like to address some of the reviews i see on here i have been playing guitar since i was years old i am now so i have a few years of experience first you guys who complain about the plastic housing are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals if you are stop doing it all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works the plastic housing is extremely strong and won t bust when used properly the next thing i would like to address is the battery running down even when it s turned off every effects pedal i ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain it will save you a fortune the ones saying the sound sucked buy something besides a amp and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain thi is a good pedal and i ve used it on stage for years without a problem that means i have spent about a year for a pedal that has earned me thousands buy one learn how to use it and you ll be happy works well easy to install and take out helps greatly to control acoustic feedback i ve looked at these for a while glad i purchased it if an initially unfavorable opinion changes i owe it to the maker to say so so i m saying so for me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used it s not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down in many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved as far as the sn is concerned wrong i ve found the sn to in fact be super tight but one has to insure that there isn t even a hint of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar this is what i don t like about the other type of snark display it s not symmetric it requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit if the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat when i m on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish in that regard the image shown here is wrong it shows the super tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with green and even a yellow uhm no the sn is super tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semi tones if that s what floats your boat and as they say on tv all for an incredibly low price i keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case at this price i already have a half dozen super tights with two more on the way
110	i know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out but honestly this thing is worth every penny it cuts your changing time down drastically you don t really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller winder and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool not to mention it s very rigid and it certainly seems like it ll hold up for years to come good quality one i like the big size type would like to have a thinner one so far so good i prefer my spring loaded capo but this one works ok on my guitars i m surprised i haven t broken it yet usually picks are picks but these are a blast i play by holding the horns between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes i had to order extra bags of these because people keep begging for one works really well was a great price and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time the capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar i bought this for my acoustic bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo holds my bass guitars easily as well works great easy to use my classical guitar stand was metal and short like this but did not have the front brace or download slant if i had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it s headstock on the hard flood so sad i mourn it still
111	my eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo it s easy for him to use and adjust very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced i use it with my stringer in open g tuning would buy other products from this company i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician i record songs in my home as a hobby i like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting so if you re at or around the same level you know what i m talking about will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much no are you likely to find it in a high end professional studio eh probably not is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point hells yes i ve worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious and this is the nicest mic i own right now the difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals sm and this was still the case but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then aren t all mic evaluations subjective you can go on all day about response range and eq flatness but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful my only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn t seem to be a super tight cardioid because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it perhaps this is how it s supposed to be but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously it can be a headache trying to jury rig an isolation method that works i took off a star for this alone although that may not be fair since i haven t used any other large diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they re all supposed to behave this way sound quality the bx sounds neutral and balanced compared to similar sized consumer speakers they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs i e teen eq the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours it also lacks a midrange bump and sounds a bit recessed or laid back compared to average earbuds or home speakers in fact the bx sounds similar to my sennheiser hd headphones but with less lower bass and that s a good thing for mixing as you don t want speakers that add color and or bumps in the frequency response unlike typical passive stereo speakers the bx is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer i e bi amped this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver the downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing at first the bx struck me as underpowered for a watt rating at least with a signal directly from my mac pro however once jacked into the hotter signal from my motu ultralite the true power of the bx was revealed it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked these are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out your head should form a triangle with the two speakers that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties so don t buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use i mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings live and multitrack so the bass range is perfect for me the bass extends down to a clear hz so plenty ump for drop d and drop c tuning if you mix bass guitar and kick drum you ll want larger speakers bx or a sub but these are great for guitar i m used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass mid and highs for different room responses and taste oddly the pdf instructions show eq switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure rfi resistance i m an inner city dweller and live in a high rfi area cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes so one of the major selling points for me was m audio s claim of rfi shielding luckily that was no mere marketing jive they really are well shielded against rfi not a single wayward drum loop or dj in my tracks not even when cranked i can t make that claim for prior speakers i ve owned heat these speakers run on the warm side the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions i live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up not a deal breaker but it s wise to turn them off when not in use i use a power strip so i don t have to flip two separate switches construction these are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed cinema display and motu ultralite construction appears very good with dense particle board mdf cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit and matching plastic front molding around the drivers the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl these monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam and the tweeters sport silk domes no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick connections like most studio monitors the bx comes with pro audio style jacks for inch phone plug trs and xlr if you re a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks rca or usb so you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters if you re an experienced recordist you should have plenty of these cables laying around but otherwise be prepared to reach for your wallet one of the things i like about the bx is both the trs and xlr connections are active at the same time allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches i have an audioengine d dac connected to the trs phone input for itunes movies games etc while a motu ultralite for mixing tracking is plugged into the xlr connection last blurb yes the small focal speakers i listened to were better sounding and louder than the bx but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches however a perfect monitor for a home studio isn t only about a good neutral sound but also about compactness appearance and value and the bx nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine this is my new favorite tuner not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently it works like a champ i don t mean that it works i mean that it works better than any of my other tuners it is super tight it recognizes pitch differences that my ear can t leaving a better tune than my rp or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like i ve got laying around i plan on buying these for all my guitars
112	when i first started setting up my little studio i wanted something that didn t break the budget i tried a couple different combo pedal boards digitech boss me but quickly realized i wasn t getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up with not much left i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro who would think this thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds as are most of this line of pedals i now own about of these of all types and have never been dissapointed save it s very hard to chain them without a lot of noise then i got into guitar building and they all got put away lately i have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills and joy of joys i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them forget the fab series they are not so hot buy the old style as the tuna melt or the big metal ones like the dan echo you will not be sorry wanted a way to plug in my boss me to save on batteries didn t want to drop the money on a boss psa so i got this one instead which does the same job just for less money i have owned two of these stands the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared the second one must have walked off on its own while i was moving to a new place not the greatest stands by any means but for what they re worth i didn t mind spending another to get one sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable but price ability to collapse and it s light weight made it the one i bought again this has a good weight nice connections and all together fender charm pretty decent price compared to gc as well i ve never had one of these pots fail on me never had one go scratchy i m sure they will as most pots will but i ve either been fortunate or these are very well made pots works with myon stage ks classic double x keyboard standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by on stage as wellon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackworks as advertised you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it
113	i love this pop filter it is every to attactch and doesn t scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do the adjustable arm is very flexible yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement this works great for mic ing guitar amps the stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp this is the best usb condenser mic i ve ever used i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr i bought the at xlr version simply due to the fantastic results i ve achieved with this one i only use this microphone for podcasting i do not record music with it but i haven t tried yet if you re curious as to the sound quality listen to my podcast rock crushes paper on itunes and zune marketplace just to give you an idea of what i m using windows gb rampentium dual core ghzadobe auditon the build quality is fantastic built like a tank really the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand yes it s a tripod stand but i can t imagine actually being in a spot where i d rather use that then the on stage desktop mic stand anyways great mic can t recommend it enough it s made me check out other audio technica products
114	this is my third circuit breaker cable i play in church and no one wants to here the pop if i have to leave the sanctuary why three foot foot and foot depending on the setup for the group i hate cable jump rope i really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand i use holds my picks in place nicely snaps on microphone stand firmly never come up short again its just a nice accessory to have and cheap too you know when a good quality item arrives everything looks and works just as it is intended i love it the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated the seat is very soft and comfortable however it doesn t appear to hold anyone with excess weight i have this hooked up to pedals so far and it s awesome real cost saver on batteries you really cant go wrong for the price the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe this cable arrived today and i am still in shock it s truly amazing the best by far patch cable i have ever used or even seen in years of guitar playin huge value buy one now
115	made of quality material i do not need anything fancy because i am a simle person it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar replacing your pickguard lost a screw authentic replacement screws if you need them i ordered these with a new pickguard for my strat in case i lost or boogered up one of the screws exactly like stock screws these knobs fit well on the pots in my strat and they match the color of the black fender pickguard as well they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job what more could you ask of strat knobs a very handy item great for sitting by your practice amp when you don t want to be bothered with stepping all over your footers the wire could be a little heavier but you can t beat the value the plugs are the standard screw down type with well soldered joints i ve used this now for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord works like its supposed to no complaints at all for the price i will be buying more in the future this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer it works as expected and has proven to be durable i don t hesitate to drop it in my gig bag knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show
116	i bought two of these for my band and they are fantastic granted they are not the hercules stands that i use but they work for my two other singers great quality and i would definitely buy them again i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack that i had i m quite please with the xenyx lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound i m very happy with this little mixer i picked this simple interface up back in and i can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years it s been gigged dropped and even rained on however it still sounds great and functions perfectly i was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free asio all driver i was able to get anywhere between ms and ms latency under windows it was plug and play with the default wdm driver however to really take advantage of capabilities you ll want to install asio all especially if you re using ableton fl studio energyxt etc all and all the uca is pretty limited however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your pc for the functionality alone it s definitely worth asking price just as good as any xlr out there considering i spent for it it rules will buy more when needed i compared this to a c which is pretty good for half the price i also tried two mxls one v this is much better hands down even if it costs x as much i noticed the difference on guitar on vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you but i realized that it s normal and the other mike just didn t pick stuff up which is worse the mxl v g sounded warm on vocals and not too bad on guitar but if you got too close it gave you this fake low voice and that s just like taking the at signal and modifying it after you ve recorded it besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me i tried the cad m that did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids i heard the at wasn t as good as the at so i went for it and it s more than the switches difference which i don t use anyway i didn t like the switches on the cad m either it s confusing and i do gain or filter in my daw i considered the nt but at bucks more than the it seemed like they were very similar at the end i m satisfied with the it s a work horse and costs a fraction of the more popular studio amps that have only a subtle difference to me i have been staying away from at products because i didn t like the headphones compared to sony s but this time i caved in because i don t see anything that competes at my price range for me this works like an sm microphone and costs about the same i can record my acoustic or electric guitar out of the cab or sing in it my challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room i ve removed the door on my closet put a shower curtain with a down comforter on it and record in there ridiculous setup but i ve save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that for most vocals recording i don t use the closet just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise so if things don t change this is my choice for best vocal and instrument microphone in the price range nice solid construction and vibration mount included it s rugged and i like it
117	not bad if you dont use any batteryand use a vdc adapter thingie make sure thingie outputs at least ma if you can tried mic bass and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing all workand the

even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing a good thing for the price it is worth in the old days we used tobe able to buyall nylon clear strings now tis almost impossible with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar one will prefer playing on the hi treble strings very nice resonant and clean not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other supposed to bebass strings i dont know again like someone else noted the obvious sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is gigantic this makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even makes it sound like different geeetars totally sucks bad now oohthanks man garbage if you like it then buy it this is not how the world of music sounds too much bass and other garbage are you guys really hearing anything world has gone bass crazy since about more and more we lost analog we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp and now to put morecrap into our ears they give you onefrequency bass only take it or leave it will go find real headphones thanks kb what part u dont likeyo u can use eq to wash

118	it just randomly pops off my bass it s so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down i hate it the tweed really grips on your shirt the quality is perfection and they even give you a little string if your using it for acoustic which i thought was sweet love fender i ordered this as a spare and at this time i haven t used it my microphone came with it s own cable and this was for a what if situation i gave it stars on just expectation i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine i only use a few of them it s good to find what style fits you i d recommend it for finding what suits you
119	i had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified then it worked like a charm glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig clear amazing cable very underrated incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall this is a very useful item easy to build and setup easy to use i don t have any problem with this stand at all and all of those people who have problems with the arms that move when you touch them that is part of the design it should not be a problem to you or your guitar thanks austin garcia if you need a simple normal length strap this should work fine however if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side this is not what you need i bought this but wound up ordering theernie ball black polypro strapinstead very similar look and feel but the ernie ball is much longer the lowest i could get this to hang was just above my waist again not a bad strap just not for us tall guys
120	i use these pins on some of my size guitars not really sure if i can notice a difference in sound between these plastic or ebony pins that i have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different i only play elixir strings they are relatively finger friendly hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings i have played in the past these were for an electric acoustic i just bought which is why i got a lighter string than i normally play i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar of course they will be elixirs as well i recommend itthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityi like the sound it is very goodthank you for this product i ve been using and abusing pedal effects since the s running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years i said all that b c i don t want to come off as condescending i ve learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative you ll fry a boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except digitech which want plugs make sure the voltage matches a v adaptor into a v pedal won t power it checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the behringer pedals i use about six of them on my board see product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor i fried a bbe delay the same way happy effecting behringer sm slow motion effects pedalbehringer dd guitar delay effect pedalbehringer cs compressor sustainer ultimate dynamics effects pedalbehringer adi v tone acousticbehringer pb preamplifier volume boosterbehringer ph classic phase shifterbehringer us ultra shifter harmonist ultimate pitch shifter harmonist effects pedalbbe two timer dual modedigitech dgr grunge analog distortion pedalelectro harmonix micro q tron envelope follower pedaljim dunlop m mxr m distortion digitech rp guitar multi effects processor i really like this delay it s simple and works well i really am starting to love behringer great pedal for a great price this is a really nice microphone it sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price i would buy this again
121	i ve used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect very easy to grip and last long one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind highly recommand this for anyone needs pick i figured at this price i wouldn t be able to use this strap to secure my dean from hell guitar but figured if it wasn t up to being a reliable strap for my expensive pretty heavy ax that i could always use it for my rock band guitar and i m rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar so very pleased with this strap would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar that s likely plastic and very lightweight plenty of cord to move around with makes it less likely that i am going to clip the cord on a down stroke just what the guitar doctor ordered works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks i d use it for lightweight guitars using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage this strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage great cable for patching in and rocking out it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well recommend to anyone looking for a good quality without an over the top price cable nice to get these for ur effects they are great product and does exactly what they supposed to connect ur pedals great cable short and useful also quiet as an old school guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous with a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at definitely too large for our practice studio and a bit too heavy to lug around i researched every multi effect unit on the market today decided the me was the best way to go for me mainly for the manual settings when i received the unit it came out of the box ready to go other than installing batteries and worked exactly like i had my rig shrunk down into a rugged small package cosm with the amp simulation pre amp portion i don t need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knob effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion this unit combines everything i need then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking i do not venture into the unit s ability to remember settings because every venue i gig at has different acoustics constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones i want to hear
122	durable affordable easy to grasp and use i ve had my wah pedal for a number of years now what i can say is that it has put up with a lot of use no problem with the pedal itself mechanically however the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product that is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time if you mount it on a pedal board you will probably remove those feet and this won t be a problem also the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal if you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable at least on my unit the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat what i have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push all the way in otherwaise zap other than those two issues the power issue really no fault of dunlop s if you use the supplied power cable its been a great pedal a classic that will surely live on i love these picks the flex is just right for me and they last forever i have never had one break i started experimenting on strings i ll try using bronze strings i noticed when i was using the phosphor bronze after a while it started to sound dull when i switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer i decided i would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time i would recommend others to try it i am years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months as you can imagine i need to practice a lot my wife of years does not enjoy my practicing especially when i practice monotonous scales i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor s web site i love it easy to put on and take off the rubber won t hurt your violin bridge or strings you can barely hear it in the next room you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge my violin s tone doesn t change much at all with this mute now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me i bought a cheap guitar that sounded really bad i replaced the stock strings with the d addario strings and it made it sound much better i first became aware of the ebow way back in the s when the song big country by the band big country came out they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound i finally purchased an ebow about a year ago i m a songwriter and record my own demos at home i also perform live in a cover band i don t use the ebow very often but when i do it really adds to the performance i recorded an ebow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional for live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating with practice i think this could improve i play the solo on stp s sour girl and it sounds very much like the original recording people in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and i get questions about how it works i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again practice could improve this the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound battery life is exceptional i have only had to replace the battery once overall i think this is a great product i wish it had been a bit less expensive but if i lost it i d buy another one i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price i previously had thelucero lc classical guitar black black which i was completely happy with as a beginner when it got damaged beyond repair i looked into thecordoba dolce size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i didn t really like the size so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar while it isn t it the prettiest guitar out there it s by no means ugly even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar the smell of this guitar is also amazing it doesn t have the cheap wood glue smell of other low end guitars but a nice rich smell of wood even after a few months kept in a humicase the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars especially those at a lower price range not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of being a cedar guitar the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package it is a high quality gig bag with lots of padding inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books when i ordered this guitar from amazon the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely overall i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years highly recommended if you play a string instrument this one is a must i have several and a snark for each one unfortunately in the span of about two years they ve gone from about in bulk to about double that it s a good product but shop around wisely for the best price and hint read the fine print if they include a battery you ll pay lots more i even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store five stars for performance take away one for greed and another comment in i decided to buy more but went to another source which only charged one shipping price not i ve been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as i play on a weekly basis and it has been great being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient it grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily i ve owned it for a while now and haven t had any problems with it
123	this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit i m not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable over all i would not recommend this product the only complaint i have about this is that there s no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over this probably doesn t matter to all of y all though other than that it s a very nice machine with a flashing light and two click options easy to use and quality built pegleg jj s are great tubes this at replaced a ax in the preamp of an epi valve jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone it was very nice but i found an old american made au that i like more the jj is still a great tube i am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar but i purchased this sn to replace the piece of junk first tuner i had i m very happy with the size of the sn it s small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus it takes up very little room on the headstock and does not interfere when i make tuning adjustments the chip clip style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my ibanez acoustic and i think my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner the user interface is very simple and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions the instruction manual is adequate but the sn seemed very intuitive for me to use the product arrived on time as shown well packaged for what i believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change i ve had this sn for a couple months now and will update this review down the road thanks for reading and if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will do the best i can to answer spo works well even with a room full of noise plus it s easy to see these are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a guitar or uke
124	i do like this pick as well it s the third color of the same pick i purchased i will probably always use these quiet almost hum free clear respose no volume control doesn t befront me because i use it to record to play thru a pa where either i or someone else keeps the volume under control it tends to be bass heavy but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that i had used one in the past this is a more solid unit fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar also in two others i use here and there great job great value got herre quick in a nice little carry bag i will update if problems come later don t see why or how tho this epiphone hardshell case is a real bargain well built and functional just the perfect size for your dot casino or in my case a sheraton ii finished in faux leather a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort much like the old fender tolex nice hardware on this case all the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid hinges too the handle isn t going anywhere inside you get a nice soft plush interior the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitar top all that off with feet on the end for standing upright well placed feet on the side and on the bottom no matter which way you place the case other than upside down both your guitar and case are protected you get a total of five good quality latches one of them locks key included and hinges at either end as i said the hardware on the case is really good for under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain i was immediately struck by how solid this case feels it is no lightweight either i feel totally secure keeping and transporting my sheraton ii in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open etc mine came almost scuff free out of the box but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing still it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price if i could make just two criticisms it would be that i notice the stitching appears to be single stitched rather than double stitched also the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented it is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break also when you close the case instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing i would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself this is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroom i have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon overall i am extremely pleased with this case and my sheraton ii is happy to have found a long term home an excellent value highly recommended i haven t measured signal throughput so i can t comment on that but where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle this thing simply will not crimp will not kink up on itself does not get twisted and has no tension in it it s the easiest handling cable i ve ever dealt with a real pleasure when you ve got all kinds of wires running all over it s like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections i have a footer with one right angle connection and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a telecaster i really like this foot controller because you don t have to reach to the amp all the time to change channels i wish i had the big usb cable but i can t find it in walmart this paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but it s gone now anyway this thing is nice if you re too lazy to reach to the amp to change channels i think the product should have been around this is a pretty cool product i have mine next to my computer because i am constantly waiting on video to render and i am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand it is also good to have when i am using garage band and need to set the guitar down for a second if you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it won t work the guitar wobbles and falls out but it works great on carpet the pick bucket is a nice touch keeps picks from scattering all over my desk the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves i would recommend this
125	the industry standard for live performance the sm has withstood the test of time and for good reason these are the only microphones that i perform with and the on off switch makes it easier so i don t have to power down all of my gear when i am done practicing i just turn the mic off at first i thought this would be a gimmick but it was cheap so i figured what the hell once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was when performing live i always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic once i got this little guy though i just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear it also protected my mic in a fall once too can find anything better for this cheap i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool it s complicated which for a capo is saying something the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use bottom line if you don t mind the extra effort and don t plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using then maybe you will enjoy it for everyone else look elsewhere i bought this to replace an actual full out pa and was very pleasantly surprised pros great price very loud as well as clear also compact and very durable cons none bottom line as a monitor look no further i use it as a pa for practicing and it is a god send buy now this is a wonderful item that really works arrived fast having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards this makes a great gift item i own at least of these i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
126	arrive in trashed packing but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it in fact it s beautiful and totally functional the only reason it gets four stars is due to the fact that it doesn t come with a felt washer to protect your instrument and i had to fashion one myself i d buy it again but they should really include a washer arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar very easy to install but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument
127	this foot controller is wonderful switch between all four channels and the volume pedal wah pedal and built in tuner makes it the complete package for my line amp i have a couple of clip on mics that i tried out this one is definitely the best i use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke you do have to find the sweet spot but once you do it works great through my pignose amp and actually fits right inside my pignose great value and price too my c ce washburn has been a very good purchase i was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one it has the ability to plug into an amp has easy access to the battery has a built in easy to use tuner and the wiring dose not rattle about it has a good compensated saddle the frets are level and do not buzz has a truss rod in the neck and has a bound rosewood fingerboard i have always liked the sound of classic guitars like the option to plug in and am more impressed by sound than brand name a person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar it rings out very well so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in mine has some edges not well stained likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly top is a bit wavy from buffing still has some orange peel but not a lot lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top sort of a classic color that i have gotten used to now other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs this model is not i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods if something happened to it i would be likely to replace it with another one just like it a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar good job washburn
128	this capo is as good as i ve ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat great deal quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather does exactly what it s says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price these bright sounding strings are easy to play hold up well and rarely break one of my favorite strings for my les paul i tend to go with ernie ball super slinky s on my strat but these would probably sound nice on a strat as well don t panic strings marked a d f b can be used just fine for g c e a tuning they don t seem to be quite as nice as the comparable aquilas but they re half the price they were for a uke and yeah new strings do improve the sound on a uke the squier bullet that i have is actually the model without the tremolo however everything else is just about the same as the model you see above it s a nice guitar for the money nice size action and finish it s not a high end guitar so don t expect it to sound like one but for a beginner it s pretty sweet i bought a more expensive blues guitar and had planned on trading this one in or selling it however i like it so much that i plan on keeping it as a back up parts are pretty easy to come by with slight modifications but that s to be expected and fairly cheap too i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use
129	once you setup your pedalboard that s it you aren t going to move stretch or step on these cables so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue they do however allow you to make the most use of the space on yourpedalboard packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require the chorus is subtle but it seems lacking to me it is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have not a lot to say works great as a shockmount i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c s those are great mics for what they cost but the clips they come with break easily and replacements are hard to find that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well hooray if you re looking for the perfect patch cables for your effects board these are it very well manufactured durable and reliable i ll use these again and again i ve read its not really complete isolated but it does the job i didn t realise how much noise my one spot was adding i a b them both one after the other and it truly was quieter the only problem i have is my tc helicon takes volts input but ma this pedal only supplies ma so the pedal didn t work in the volt slit luckily however it does work plugged into the volt ma spot so im using it there everything else in the other volt ma slots it s a lot quieter now i recommend trying it and saving some cash
130	behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and i was skeptical about paying even bucks for an input mixer my intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox i wanted to use it for recording a drum set i wanted to do it through my m audio profire i had mics stands and a piece drum set i love my profire it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong i have no gripe with it it s just that the preamp only works on two of the inputs so i figure if i get a mixer i can use its preamped channels and run them through the inputs on my interface well it worked it worked great not only did it sound great but i was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic low noise great sound and i still had inputs on my mixer to play around with with my drum set experiment over i now had an input mixer at my disposal add two monitors and you ve got yourself a nice little pa there are no bus outputs so if you re serious about getting a descent mixer i wouldn t bother but as a starter mixer for the price offered i couldn t be happier it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties it may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple self explanatory and effective mixer i didn t need all the flash and the input output jacks on the top is way better than running them out the back of the unit i hate that the eq setup for each channel is basic hi mid low fx pan and level having an fx send is awesome when using it live i didn t think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that the thing is only x it s also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be the xenyx is a great buy had i known i would like it this much i would have paid the extra and gotten the channel one got the mics from dealer fast i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones i started useing these about yrs ago they are worth the investmentthere grat for a long performance takes alot of pressure off the shoulderif you have never used one befor try it you will like it this was for a friend who liked the way the guitar pikup worked that he ordered more for his family members i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did i am now able to play record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
131	i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard it does just what i wanted it to do the evans pedal patch will work for you great it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty i cheap buy and it works excellent its much better than what i got with my violin its been good i can t really complain considering its basically tree sap i would use this again the plastic around the ball scraped away and the ball flew out making it useless i bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs the same heads i bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven t torn these heads are amazing and a very good investment make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads excellent mother s little helper highly recommend this item it a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument a must these are a good value for quality strings strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in i m very satisfied i used to only be able to play my keyboard for up to an hour before feeling uncomfortable this chair has fixed that really am impressed with this gig bag my beloved jasmine fits perfectly inside has nice padding tons of pockets to store stuff backpack straps and handle for easy carrying and it looks fab love the price too can t go wrong with this one this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is size i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me beware because you d figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there given the advertising even the guy at guitar center when i called to find out what was going on told me to go with lute hole i never had a use for such an item before very recently but upon necessity i found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar even if it does fit be very very careful in fact be very very wary as i briefly heard a light cracking noise when i tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the g s specs i ve read elsewhere that it kills your tone but i had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig ultimately i spent nearly more than i wanted to just for this kind of item what is it they say in this era caveat emptor this is a excellent snare wire used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old pearl snare drum quick and easy to replace came with straps to secure but did not use them as i prefer string improved the snare sound by no more rattle snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound well made product that did the trick product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect great product at a excellent price sounds decent and stays in tune for the price this is just what you need if you want to dabble in on the violin sticks are well organized and always in reach this is a must have item for drummers and the well organized it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical i had thin cut strips of duct tape on my fretboard before and then i saw this not only is it alot more visually appealing but its more accurate aswell
132	as stated in the title this adapter is what you need if you use your danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries you can now plug it into the wall as advertised it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so i ve owned it the reason i took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn t seem too durable so because of this i have been very careful so it doesn t get broken you might be able to find an off brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the honeytone so you won t risk ruining it the gauges are identical to ernie ball regulars yellow label but the d addario s string tension feels stiffer which is nice for slide playing i like my action medium low comfortable for straight playing and bending solid intonation for chords yet not too much fret rattle for slide i usually stretch the heck out of ernie ball s after putting them on because they have so much spring in them i deliberately left the d addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all their new sound is quite bright as advertised but has far less of what i call new string jangle which is fine by me as a kid i d sweat that off in an hour but these days playing a number of instruments it can last awhile there s a string tension chart handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number i ll admit i d never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting but apparently that s the case and d addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set if you do come across fakes if you re willing to report it they ll provide you with a genuine replacement for free i ve used d addario phosphor bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over years and swear by their quality and consistency i ve used ernie ball s on electrics for even longer habits can be tough to break but as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots i find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings finally nailing a sound and feel you ve been chasing after for years makes it all worth it i ve used all sorts of strings over the years and generally aim for ghs strings however these power slinky strings are great i ve not broken one yet and the is a good gauge heavy powerful and they sound nice and soulful when played i may become a lifelong ernie ball user after using these strings bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones i first saw it in a big box musician s store while there was a blues guitar session going which is a public jam session open to anyone they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in i was surprised when i plugged into this amp away from that group turned it up and started playing it sounded just as good as those other amps the two employees that worked there and two other customers couldn t believe where the sound was coming from even the other players checked it out i don t understand how fender has managed to keep this amp a secret for so long poor marketing maybe i don t know but if you want a blues or blues rock amp with some great vintage tones check these out pick up a used one they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tin like has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models a couple of the marshall settings aren t bad either this amp sounds better than the super champ to my ears tried this out at the store as well which makes sense since it s a class a amp as opposed to class b warmer and more articulate the speaker is decent but this amp also sounds great using an external speaker cabinet for home jamming and recording blues without driving everyone nuts this amp is a god send check one out and you ll want it yes i would buy is a great strap nice comfort nice pricefits nice in to my fender guitar a thumbs up
133	i was expecting a so so mike for the price boy was i surprised this mike is great one thing i did notice was that if it wasn t fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing other than that it works great small light weight stunning fender blackface looks warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me it is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio the direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder mixer and still give you the amp s skeaker as a monitor for yourself what could be easier and it mikes well too by the way the choice is yours there with no led display cost increase if one was there and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive it s so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun and practicle too the voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates the tweed blackface and marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp love the reverb in the fx section the spring reverb is so well done that i bumped the amp once and was looking for the spring chrash known from amps with the real spring reverb it s that good once again the controls are easy and direct never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort who cares if it doen t have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection you want that go waste your money on a line or something this champ is made for one thing to give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort i believe it has accomplished that well again a shame that fender has dropped this model from the line up of products the super model is a step up in power and speaker size but also the cost is higher as well i m just glad that i got one of these from amazon com when i did and will not part with the amp been playing for five decades now and i know when i have a good instrument or gear and when i don t this model is a keeper to be sure and i don t even like digital how s that for an endorsement it s that good for what it does it is built like a tank but it quit working after a couple of weeks i haven t made time trouble shoot it yet so i m not sure what component has failed i have a love hate relationship with compressors for you can t go wrong with this one i use it a lot on my practice rig if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley knob i use a keeley in my live shows expensive but worth it as for this joyo i can t complain it does it s job pretty good but it does color your tone some what true bypass is nice it s noticeable in your chain but not to much to take it out i love for my practice rig good buy if you re on a budget all us musicians are just don t expect to blown away by it for give it a shot i did and don t regret it
134	i have a few shure sm s which cost more i like the open sound of the pg but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the sm s i like this mic ok but the sm is worth the extra money i think especially if you expect to push its capability i do not have much to say about this it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine i found myself actually trying to see if it will rip for the purposes of this review just so i could make some sort of comment about it you can rip it if you try but it s not likely to happen during everyday use it s fairly thick if that isn t what you want then i would look elsewhere this should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn t have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen this microphone clip becomes loose at the hinge very quickly and needs to consistently be tightened too much of a hassle really bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design works great and base is out of your way much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around
135	has a good sound stays in tune wish it came in a darker grain of wood a little bulky my arm goes to sleep sometimes after extended playing wish it was a little thiner i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price works like it is suppose to good quality i am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song thank you kyser capos jim dunlop has produced these for more years than i d like to admit to personal knowledge as long as i can remember i ve had one in my case and one on the workbench there are dozens of wannabe models but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol jim dunlop s i gotta remember not to get the black ones though i seem to lose them to easily or maybe they are really that good and they just get borrowed this is definately worth the money i was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all bought another one for my friend i ve used a variety of tuners when the snark first came out the price was so low i thought it must not be that good however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several what i like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display is seems to be very accurate the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners about the only thing that has been an issue is that on occation it won t register turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem also it may be a litle larger than some like
136	dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it s a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing i can see the merits of screw on locks what with the ease of switching the locks but these work fine for me for your money i can t recommend the eq enough it s cheap works well and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard what can i say that you haven t already read about this amazing pedal if you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal if your looking to play out with it know that it s cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds have a backup take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal that alone can cause problems as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal it has out muscled my other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard i use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and i never turn it off once we start playing i leave it plugged in on the board all the time i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off i carry a backup pedal i love this pedal just don t ever drop it i ve never really owned a fuzz pedal before but have tried a few out of most i ve tried i ve come across the big muff the most it didn t really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently even my boss hyper metal hm is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks but it isn t there certainly my budget being what is it right now i didn t want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal there are loads of fuzzes available for or less but this model is essentially three pedals in one that s what attracted me to it along with a few reviews in youtube not to mention the bargain basement price the three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal the two fuzz modes in my view don t perfectly emulate any one pedal but are extremely useful nonetheless fuzz is a creamy midrange filled sound it doesn t get too bright until the treble knob is pushed past o clock this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick with humbuckers it s actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about o clock i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay it seems to work best with power chords root th note and single notes if you play complex chords you ll hardly notice them if you try to play them use as little gain as possible fuzz is more in line with the big muff it has a scooped midrange which makes things sound dark and sinister with the increased bass and treble complex chords work slightly better here this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz so it buzzes longer this makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that s using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn t necessarily fuzzy head era korn comes to mind for me the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile boost this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level it actually distorts a little but that s only after cranking the eq and gain knobs all the way up the resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non master volume amp or a master volume s clean channel fully cranked still throughout most of its gain and volume range boost does a good job of staying clean this would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound it might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects overall i like the tones this pedal spits out i ve only had it a few hours but i love what i m hearing so far the build is similar to the other behringer pedals i have a nr noise reducer and a to their overdrive that sounds like a tube screamer with this more recent pedal built on june of the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before i d still not abuse them too much though as always really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank you can t go wrong with the bright blue led either makes it easy to see on a dark stage along with the dayglo orange pedal color
137	the wire clipper and winder work o k but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn t slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out bad design by someone who doesn t use it to pull pins out of a bridge i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out i ve done it successfully for years i really love the fact that they are color coded so you don t mix your strings up and easy on my fingers i love the price they are a very good brand and easy to install highly recommend the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn t very friendly snark rotates to any position i want but intellitouch ends up being upside down it works fine but it s inconvenient this little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under seconds i ve even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch pros dead on accurate you can easily set your intonation with this little monster works great in extremely loud environments clips on tightly if you don t jump around like an orangutan on stage you could probably have the snark ride your headstock through the whole show you don t have to plug into it extremely responsive enough display detail for you to know when you re getting close to in tune not just indicators like some tuners flat dead on sharp very inexpensive cons a little twitchy on the open low b string on bass i use the th fret harmonics first partial to tune however since it s a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more so this has never really been a problem for me inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case for every instrument you own if your looking for a great fast and accurate tuner for your guitar or bass this is the one for you it is easy to see in light or dark venues has great build quality and helps to tune your instrument in record time i don t go anywhere without it it may well be the last tuner you ll ever need flaws are few the battery life could be better and it wont work with acoustics no built in mic but then you know that before you buy it so you cant really complain it would just be nice if it included one is all all told if you need a great tuner look no further this is one of the best especially for the price paid why are you still reading this buy it already
138	put my schecter c custom fr in drop bb these strings sound great and have a great low end highly reccomend these strings from d addario are a personal favorite of mine i love the ej light gauge for their size and ease of use i think the light gauge is a nice size that won t hurt your fingers or put undue stress on your guitar not only that but they sound great not too big or not too small i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends to me this makes it much easier when changing strings you don t have to worry about mixing up your strings i ve also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands give these a try i think you ll be satisfied their are two issues with these strap locks that i have come across the first issue is with thick straps i purchased a nice leather levi s strap which i love but their didn t seem to be enough threads on the lock to fit the strap on i managed to get it to work by thinning the leather of the strap with a vise overall it wasn t a huge issue just a bit annoying the second issue is actually a very concerning to me both of my guitars have begun to randomly unclip themselves from the straps and fallen to the ground not good i think it has something to do with the metal on the locks getting either bent or worn down whatever it is i don t like having my guitars fall to the floor i have these on two of my guitars both of which are very heavy it s the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument they re pretty easy to put on the strap and guitar and they do securely hold the instrument in place mostly i ve had them on one of my guitars for over ten years and on the other for over five i probably won t change to a different set of locks for fear of stripping the holes on my guitars but my next guitar will be getting some dunlop straplocks http www amazon com dunlop design straplok system nickel dp b czvxm ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords straplock which seem a lot better and more sturdy there s nothing not to like about this capo i have two of them i ve played guitar for over years and have used other types of capos i like this one s low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard by turning a knob to tighten it rather than rely on a spring as on the clip on type it takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip on type but i like the results better this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe i have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and i love them all
139	i haven t really used this guitar stand because i have been keeping my acoustic guitar in the case so i can keep the humidity nice adding water to a sponge i cut and placed into a plastic bag that i poked tiny holes in with a small nail the stand works as advertised i love these picks medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people this is a great looking pic and you get of them at such a great price i wouldn t buy anything else i have ordered several of these like or i love them they are great for holding picks make wonderful gifts there is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these i have several came in perfect working condition great buy after reading the reviews i expected the leather to be a tougher than it is it s soft without being limp there s no break in time required i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great i like to keep a pre adjusted strap in each guitar case and i m planning to buy another one of these for my martin look at the price because this thing really sounds good it s no toy it s a real retro electric guitar effects pedal i m very happy with this purchase now i can use the clean channel on my amp with this pedal for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel for my other pedals and my electric guitar not high quality but has cut dolphin detailing on the tuners just as described works like it should good or begginers it does the job as described it though i have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me comfortable and very nice fabric love it looks awesome with my white jackson and u can also adjust it to your body this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal i heard good things about the build quality but didn t end up with a biyang until i needed a reverb pedal turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal most of the popular options or and up at around the tri reverb has a distinct advantage in price but don t underestimate its quality as some other reviewers noted the reverb can get extremely deep and lush if you so desire i found myself with the blend and time knobs around for a practical spring reverb there s a multi switch for hall spring and room there are subtle differences between the three but i d be lying if i said they sounded dramatically different the a b switch isn t well explained but if you re in a mode the effect is much more dramatic i found that operating in b mode was similar to the type of reverb i had enjoyed on my amps note it has a stereo input and output but i only use one input output so i can t comment on that at the end of the day it s a fairly simple always on effect and the biyang does the job without costing a fortune but what makes it star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality having a thumb mini screw to open the v compartment instead of a plastic door or needing a phillips screwdriver is a big deal also love that the v jack is on the top of the unit away from the other jacks the pots are smooth and easy to turn and the mini switches and footswitch are boutique level quality this is a great reverb pedal i don t think i ll ever need another one these tuners are so convienient and i have yet to see a musician i show these to who who doesn t appreciate it s simplicity
140	i like it it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s guitar and it looks good overall i recommend the graphtech pq c tusq fully compensated acoustic guitar saddle will replace any broken or worn saddle to give you a very food sound that may require just a little sanding to make it fit perfect for your guitar i replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar while these strings are a bit harder to play they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play they do sound great a lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar
141	i have a korg tuner but found that i needed this so it would not pick up sounds in the room and interfere while i was tuning my dulcimer now i just plug this into the tuner and thenclip it onto the headstock of my dulcimer now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke i guess i don t like the way the uke sounds when using them it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff but i am sure other people may disagree as far as the quality and vendor delivery i am happy and i have no complaints i use the picks occasionally yes i would recommend them to other uke players i would like to let people know they are very stiff i guess i thought being felt they wouldn t be so stiff but i am new to playing an instrument and i guess i just don t have much knowledge about picks as a guitar player i recently march started to play the uke i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument these string play good and stay in tune pretty well i will buy again if you have a ukulele you know or may not know that it needs constant tuning especially with new strings this little gadget does the trick i was pleased to see that it is a no brainer to use and since it clips to the head it is there when you need it between songs you will not go wrong with this purchase and i am sure you will love it better than trying the my dog has fleas tuning method oh yea it does not just limit you to the basic notes for the uke but will tell you sharp and flat notes too now put that order in i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy i love the hola small instrument stand it is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when i go to the ukulele club it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand it is very lightweight which is also a plus i use the stand at home too i stand my ukulele on it because sometimes i play and then i want to go to youtube to listen to a particular song it is very convenient i have recommended this stand to others also features i like lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
142	purchased the string kyser capo when i meant to get the string version slightly longer stronger spring but find that this string capo not only works great on my string acoustics but also works on my string acoustic with a little adjusting quality seems top notch design is simple and effective firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick they are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold i can play all night without dropping it i bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my hondo ii the paul which i bought in the stock ones were loose lots of backlash in the worm gears and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new they went in easily if you follow this hint if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged disregard this hint the holes for the old machine heads on the hondo ii were in diameter and these new grovers need a diameter hole so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes it s almost impossible to use a drill even in a drill press without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc so what i did was first use a threading tap for metal screw threads which at the bottom had a diameter and at the top had a diameter this is a standard threading tap i chucked the tap into my battery powered hand drill set to low speed and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to in diameter then i used a tapered reamer from both sides to enlarge the holes to the required diameter quick clean easy if you have a different size enlargement to make use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to diameter another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time like when changing strings you don t want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod at least i don t want to now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune a very worthwhile upgrade zero backlash in the worm gears on the grovers beautifully chromed and smooth as silk these are amazing i m an intermediate player have been for the last years i tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip every other pick i have used has turned in my fingers loose grip little sweat slick finish ok now thin med heavy you can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it and i can even hold onto it very nice grip on these i have to keep getting more cuz everytime i hand one to someone to try it s the last time i see it just hit add to cart you won t be sorry i bought one of these at a music store like years ago for bucks i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin later i saw them for here on amazon and i bought for myself for a sister and another for my brother in law these are a great deal i can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud it just uses vibration of the instrument i like cool gadgets and this is no exception the red color is a metallic color and i totally dig it the display is nice and bright as well super accurate tuning well worth it for the price i keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost what more could you want i have the snark but read that this was the best so far i got and agreethis works better i would recommend it to anyone
143	all these harmonicas in one case and they sound great you have to get use to the plastic but it is very easy to do and once you do get ready to play away nice tone and fun one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers well after starting to use it on windows x i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings i went to the behringer website i found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use windows i am using this with a behringer fx mixer it is a good combo the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough i treat my gear with care i figure it ll probably last for years and years and years i am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation i have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard i wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time so i tried this cable and it works perfectly very heavy cord and top quality construction can t beat the price either will buy again i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable i was surprised at how cool both the tin and the picks were they are a real talking point and a must have for muso s who like individual items in their collection thanks again cheers i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar
144	i was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all i expected i use it for practice and recording myself i really like it but for the price i wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect i have it on my martin d which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and i was skeptical about paying even bucks for an input mixer my intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox i wanted to use it for recording a drum set i wanted to do it through my m audio profire i had mics stands and a piece drum set i love my profire it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong i have no gripe with it it s just that the preamp only works on two of the inputs so i figure if i get a mixer i can use its preamped channels and run them through the inputs on my interface well it worked it worked great not only did it sound great but i was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic low noise great sound and i still had inputs on my mixer to play around with with my drum set experiment over i now had an input mixer at my disposal add two monitors and you ve got yourself a nice little pa there are no bus outputs so if you re serious about getting a descent mixer i wouldn t bother but as a starter mixer for the price offered i couldn t be happier it works fantastic for small gigs or god forbid house parties it may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple self explanatory and effective mixer i didn t need all the flash and the input output jacks on the top is way better than running them out the back of the unit i hate that the eq setup for each channel is basic hi mid low fx pan and level having an fx send is awesome when using it live i didn t think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that the thing is only x it s also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be the xenyx is a great buy had i known i would like it this much i would have paid the extra and gotten the channel one i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me it filled a hole that was missing since of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph classic side by side with the mxr there wasn t a hole lot of difference and with the behringer s added swirl switch gives you a few more options it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals i ve read a ton of reviews and still haven t heard of one breaking because of the plastic as far as value to money spent this pedal is again at the top of the list oh it also sounds great nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer play practice periods and less finger fatigue i would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic especially good for beginners this pedal solved my problem with my amp after years of messing about with my mesa boogie realizing the the california sound is not what i truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a marshall or vox this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a marshall or vox one can say all kinds of things about quality but for it made me even more versatile it needs to be in front of a tube amp
145	hosa makes good stuff this is no exception i ve trusted them for years i can t think if a single hosa cable i ve owned that s failed this is my second way switch and it won t be the last the four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series which gives a fatter tone than position and more output than positions or i am very pleased with the new sound of my tele the wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun don t forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder another easy modification for my indonesian telecaster squier better looks and function tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides works like a charm powers up to five v effects using one power supply i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly no more dead v batteries some effects eat v batteries like a year old with a cone of cotton candy this strap replaces another one just like it which i use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons for stage i like something heavier good quality the holes work with my strap buttons okay my lower button is an output jack for an after market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button but this strap works okay with it it just takes a little more force to get it on which i m sure will go away over time with use great price for a simple strap at around old good design for the price i ve bought of them and just put it on all guitars so wouldn t have to search for pick again put these on my prs se and i love em i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe they were a perfect fit no problems whatsoever the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great for what it s supposed to do it works very well i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think this is still usable but it is for very big fingers i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there but this still leaves some extra room either way it works well it feels very sturdy and i m not worried about it cracking anytime soon for the price it s a must have i read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than i do and since most people seemed to like it i figured i d give it a try i was not disappointed at all it gives you great sound for solos i ve tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that it s quite versatile i still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound i want but i think that s just learning about the effects this box provides i was upgrading all the chrome on a mim and put this on looks better than the plain one includes the screws for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase i feel it sounds really good and has many settings i think the build on these are fine for daily use don t expect it to break anytime soon anyway it s odd to review such a simple thing as screws what can i say they re shiny and screwed well into the holes i have at least of these i like the small footprint plus it collapses for flat storage or transport holds acoustic or electric good quality stable economical i have read that the foam padding can react with nitrocellulose lacquer and mar the instruments finish i haven t seen that on my older stands but to error on the side of caution i have glued thin leather to the back and lower support of the stands it is working fine i bought the first about years ago it is still like new i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now it s time to treat myself with this gift so i don t have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china it s very rare thing to see now a days this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack it is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but that s an easy adaption if using a copy strat it works perfectly great price from the seller as well if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets this is the best thing i have done to my telecaster i had some noise even at moderate volumes after shielding it is absolutely quiet this peel and stick tape has conductive glue so you don t have to solder the overlap joints i overlapped about and had a x piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity the tape is petty easy to use sticks well inside the cavities and is strong i didn t break or tear any pieces i will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build there is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups got them in days and love them so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing this unit is very small and tucks away nicely it is easy to use i do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well i would recommend this to anyone very nice i have owned two snark headstock tuners the blue ones they are great products but i find one thing about them absolutely infuriating the design of the ball joint that connects the tuner to the clip both of my snarks have broken off at this joint i am a home player i do not put the tuners under any type of stress this fender tuner is a great alternative the way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a snark however as others have mentioned this fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a snark so for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented however for the home player this tuner will work just fine the tuner itself is much smaller than i thought it would be it is smaller than a snark but not by much the clip works well with a prs headstock which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a strat style headstock the only real negative i see is to change the battery and to put the first battery in requires the use of a very very small phillips head screwdriver i build computers so i had one handy but i would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand i have purchased about of these in the past years i have found no major issues with any of them expect to do a small amount of fretwork such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends checking the frets for crowns filing those down and polishing the frets as with any neck even the high dollar ones the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up they come unfinished but well sanded i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box i like to use coats of amber and to coats of clear lacquer satin or semi gloss none of these are select quarter sawn wood but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument
146	this stand feel sturdy and strong compact design on stand and folding for travel good for acoustic and electric guitars thick non scratch foam is a plus love it every once in awhile while browsing through amazon i come across something i don t know how i got along without and it really works awesome for accurate with tv on in the background this thing is just sweet i just love it easy no brainer
147	i read the reviews on ernie ball strings i have to say that i love the strings they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive i gave it a star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks but this ft cord is taller than i am which means it s about tall it s a great product for the money exspecially if it s just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp it s short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working for the most part this is a well built durable gig bag i only rated it at stars for the lack of padding if you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you if you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case remember you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that i bought this one after using the sn for months the tuner works like a champ i can t really tell the difference between the sn and the sn they both work really well with my taylor guitar and my fender strat very handy i just slip this into the sound hole hook it up to my amp and then when i finish playing i slip it back out this is handy when i practice at night when my wife is sleeping
148	if you want a little more meaty sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars this set is the ticket just slightly heavier feel but much more tone as usual after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension got them today and put them on a wasburn x series nice sound i would recommend these to anyone an inexpensive but nice set i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp it works really well having the two different style of ends gives you good options when putting a system together i m happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for good deal i use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations pickups on the flyand then if it sounds ok go to the big boys in my blues room the amp will reach its max in short order but again for what it is and the price it ishard to find an equal i purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive epiphone les paul jr which fits perfectly as does a squier strat on the plus side the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some but not a lot of abuse the reason i claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear that should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this one other issue i ve had with the case is i left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges especially the lip around the top of the case again this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot enclosed space for prolonged periods for inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument it is perfect for occasional gigging but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road i would not hesitate to purchase another one if i acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because i do like the better protection this particular case provides if you need a cord and don t want to pay a lot this is a good one i was surprised howsturdy it appears the only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine i love this tuner it is accurate very reasonably priced i have ordered this tuner for fellow musician friends all of them love them best clip on tuner i have ever purchased i like this a lot better than others that i have easy on and off and stays put it s worth the money
149	this is good cable excellent plugs the lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material which will hold everything in place for years grade a cable at a very affordable price definitely going back for more the ft cable was only a couple dollars more than ft these just don t have the right feel and the sound isn t that great compared to other materials the quality control is so so the picks aren t cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them i ll stick with dunlop gator grip mm or prs picks for more flexibility or acoustic i prefer fender medium celluloid picks this pick is great for strumming some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard if you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip this mic stand will work great for mic ing full stacks and guitar amps some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg these just sound flat in comparison to elixir nanowebs and they don t feel as good either i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum these are heavy duty and well made really reasonably priced i love em my les paul is heavy the strap would constantly fall off so i decided to get a set of strap locks these installed in minutes and really dont change the look of the guitar at all you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap if you dont have locks on all your guitars you cant interchange your straps easily any more so i recommend getting them for all your guitars the other added benefit i found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back with these locks the strap sits away from the guitar so it fixes that problem as well when i buy a new guitar i get new locks are there better locks out there i m not sure but im committed now as i wanted the same locks on all my guitars has never failed me yet
150	normally i prefer a harder pick but i switch to these after pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors these super light flexible nylon picks are great if you re trying to play quietly if you prefer a flexible softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick nice cables so far i ve not had any problems with them but haven t put them through a lot of use just yet also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more i ll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other these are really cheap strings but how they sound really good obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse these are the ones very nice guitar strap i bought it for my ukulele and it works fine good leather and believe it or not made in canada not china i would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case ukuleles good value great seller and fast delivery thanks amazon for a great product great value
151	i ve been recording professionally for years music radio commercials and television mostly so i ll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase i ve owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i can t remember them all but i can i say i ve never had a bad a t s s and s i use every week and have for years the going back to the mid s and the is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a t family you have no idea the of recordings that you re hearing this brand on it s used by almost every studio on every continent i work in the us italy to scotland and can attest to this but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best so it requires a phantom powered xlr input which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces which you should really purchase along with this if you haven t already because for around you ll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring you ll find one by searching audio interfaces i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don t need avid hd s to get started audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option don t try an adapter on it it won t work as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want it doesn t come with the cord what a surprise quality cords will cost about half the price of this but a version will probably do for most it doesn t come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like work with it you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do you ll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual but i can also recommend using large foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen this isn t about being cheap there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don t work at strange angles and you ll probably always need one or the other this does not come with a stand so pick up a boom stand if you don t have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over wheelers also tip over recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they ve put a faux plastic one if it s possible you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male for desktop users here s what i d do using large command strips and velcro i d fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini boomhere s another optionmxl mics mxl bcd standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting if you need something figure it out your clean quiet recording is proof that it works i can t justify comparing this to my to mics like it but if there is a better value buy it wouldn t have bought a case for most of my condensers it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics the is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a without issue also individual mics have a sound of the eight s i have i prefer of them and use them the most so when reviewers say it s bright i say compared to what i can tell you what it sounds like ka ching a great sound in audio recording uh huh i know of one professional recording it s on and the client was clueless that i used an mic think about it would this be as good as what was used years ago have you heard good s recordings anyone purchasing equipment because it sounds better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it lot s of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don t ignore them but ask yourself this do they have formal training and experience with different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost and won t be half of what you ll achieve by improving your recording technique this type of mic is excellent for overhead acoustics amps or brass and of course vocals really most recording needs having a less uni and more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it s better suited to recording just understand you can t get too loud near it or you ll overdrive it since it s designed for up to screaming vocals so back off with loud amps and brass which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it ll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor s tv that is a good thing what s bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment so don t blame a mic for your extraneous room noise you can t just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind just quiet anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical rather than electronic signal to noise ratio a db pad will reduce output but doesn t affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won t help that s not even its purpose i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam music tutsplus dot com tutorials beginners guide to acoustic treatment audio just replace the dot turn off your heat air be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between and am when the world s a quieter place and that will really help you ll likely hear how loud your computer fans are you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions but you need quiet i ve known acoustic players who ve worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing if this is what your budget allows for it s an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost i keep saying this type of mic and the reason why is because a t sells models like this style up to this model is the lowest priced but you re buying a reputable brand if your future plans include using only one mic without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware you can look here audio technica at usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at usb cardioid condenser microphone w pop filterthis is not my advice you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface this model is not usb now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds i won t tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won t apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio descriptions are worthless only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters this is important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn t the recording cannot sound better than the source so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone accurate or inaccurate not good or bad there s a difference it s during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound apply these same thoughts to your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than the recording and that s why accuracy is important in your monitors so search out any info you don t understand and don t expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling training and having worked in a professional setting if you re lucky like i was after year of tech school i worked on site repair studios often need pt and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next then after years of work tv with another year of school i became a studio owner real recording involves a facility equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital so study electronics acoustics the auditory cortex everything audio train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day it never stops when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn t mean you re educated in its use so yes i also don t recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother unless but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording quit all that sleeping eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk i have so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i m just here to help you out if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out topping tp digital mini amplifier a little large and not really light but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap very well made although the bag is a little lower quality sturdy enough to hold a big binder page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable goes up and down and tilts back no slippage this is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest the height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle the seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne i apologize but that is my best reference for comparison assembling is simple and fast i had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances i managed to get it done with no problems another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists the foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals however this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture i used this with drums but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bit the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport it s not a deal breaker on the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience this strap is genuine suede leather so it is really comfortable and has lots of friction so no sliding around on my shoulders while i m playing it s plenty long for any guitar size or shoulder width and adjusting is just like most leather straps taylor logo makes it look good and official nothing bad to say about this strap not sure if it did improve my sound or not i have a fender dreadnought acoustic and i couldn t really tell that much maybe just a little
152	how a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesn t seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what i like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isn t always possible with that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding jim dunlop s purple colored big stubby mm picks i like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the big stubby certainly meets that criteria the sharp point and the pick s rounded edges help the stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking besides electric guitar i find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semi solid body guitars where the string tension is greater i had tried the mm stubby previously but the mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all i m still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly i find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky keeping the pick clean and dry does help my favorite pick had been thedunlop mm nylon pick but i am very pleased with the performance and feel of the mm stubby i can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick the pick pack contains picks i only paid which is simply an outstanding deal if you re a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty stubby a try i used to think a pick was a pick with the only difference being stiffness i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness the only problems i had with regular picks was them slipping in my hand turning around out of my hand on the floor and of course breaking i decided to give the dava picks a try i bought a pack of the jazz picks and a pack of these grip tips i really thought i d like the jazz picks better that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick but after trying them both i find these the grip trips are now my pick of choice they fit my grip perfectly stay put in my hand and give me maximum control when i play whether it s lead or rhythm i have yet to break one i m mainly buying another set because i ve given a few away for people to try and i want to have plenty readily available i like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations so whenever i pick up a guitar to play i ve got one close by also always keep a spare in my wallet bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops sure i can still use a regular pick when that s all that s available but why not use the best when i can update been using these picks for a year since my first review still love them still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer the only reason i need to buy more i lose them i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks but for me they are still tops which is why i m buying another half dozen this pick is def not one i d use to solo with but its def a good pick for slower more acoustic oriented guitar work whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting squire fender guitar in terms of e to e string spacing the low e string out of range and not fit in the hole
153	this is a pretty cool item i bought i thought it was cool and different is well worth the price and a good thing to have in your guitar case wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better i thought my fingers were medium according to the sizing guide but no my fat fingers are not medium liked the sound the adjustability just wish i could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid i don t care about disturbing the neighbours but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling the rumble is a bit big to take everywhere i made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must at this time i am using this switch on my fender frontman r to switch between the normaland drive channels the deg jack is perfect for this and a lot of amps as there are no dials in this area i have run into the deg jack problem and the onlysolution i have found is to use a mono to stereo inch gender changer or a short monoextension cable which is what i normally use as the stereo jack presents added problems as nobody makes a inch mono female to inch mono male gender changer which i have found to be more than a little strange this is a very old style switch that is made in china like everything else but works very wellfor this simple task i have on hand ordered a set of these to put on my ibanez and on my squier they fit perfectly highly recommended although im not onstage bouncing aroung they hold the strap on just fine no changing hardware like strap locks yes more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice but i will order more
154	need volume knobs and tone so for the price and in the past i have always purchased packs together with no issues however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of sets no consistency in quality example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item also some had bright white lettering and others did not but where not vintage lettering either guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on will try other brands next time this is a good micro fiber cloth but i guess because its from ernie ball it costs more than other clothes but if you are like me its all about my axes i have one in each gig bag case i don t recommend using with polish just a wipe down after each guitar or bass use i play using this device it is portable so i always have it with me i tune the a to and this works well for that has a tuner and a metronome what s not to love best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar unless you are in a quiet area it is sensitive and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings this is a good thing it s sensitive
155	i have to tell you guys these xlr cables that i have received recently are by far the best quality cables i have ever encountered in my entire music professional life i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues does what it should and yamaha quality the price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal i am using on a yamaha board this stand it just arrived in the mail will be durable in the years to come with my music i can tell awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone this keyboard far exceeded my expectations for the price the quality of most of the bread and butter sounds is very high this keyboard also has tons of neat features there s something here for musicians of any skill level check out yamaha s product blurb to get an idea of how good this keyboard can sound search ypg on youtube and check out trying out my yamaha ypg by joshthemusician since it s also keys unweighted midi usb compliant very portable and can even run on batteries in a pinch the ypg could be used in a variety of situations one star off for a couple of caveats below other than that at around this instrument is a steal in my mind the only negatives aside from trying to install the usb midi driver see below are that yamaha sells this keyboard without the ac adapter and sustain pedal as standard accessories and you really need both yamaha should note that a lot of people feel burned by the non inclusion of the ac adapter note for those wanting to use this keyboard via usb midi on a windows systemthe usb midi drivers for this instrument are provided on a cd the disk i got only contained drivers up to windows vista i tried cheating and using this driver on my win system but it didn t work the cd will supply you with a link that should take you directly to the latest driver downloads but it doesn t i ran into a lot of problems going that route i suggest you bypass trying to use the link the cd suggests and just go directly to the yamaha website to get the latest driver much easier and my ypg now works fine with my computer but still surprising since most usb midi keyboards are plug and play
156	this amp plug is great for the price its ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price i like these straplocks but they were a little tight to get on a levy s strap i did manage to get it on however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar if you don t know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack picks make a big difference to sound and playability these are thin and flexible easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general however the tone is different so you ll need to decide what songs they work for etc as far as quality these are great easy to grip and as durable as most it beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better it slips off if you go too fast but i thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this it didn t come with much of any instructions so i was using it wrong at first there is a big and a small slot the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use the cutter works great you just have to be careful the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better all and all it s one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master i hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesn t scratch the chrome off my turner pegs that and maybe they could use a long screw and some loctite to keep it from coming loose and well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find everything i have seems to be jet black i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning for these beautiful premium quality picks is a steal this is an ok solution to keeping your picks handy and organized at least you can have one place where you can find a pick as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case but a small baggie will work just as well maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage sometimes depending on the amount and size of the pick it s hard to get the pick out of the holder and if you use something other than the standard shape forget it it has an adhesive backing so i guess you can stick it on your amp guitar wall small animal but i d rather not i ve purchased many of these cables and i ll be getting more eventually cables even good ones eventually break these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name if you need cables these work great i ve used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments they re fairly inexpensive and i ve never had a problem with them never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear abuse and i ve never had a guitar bass hit the floor a couple of warnings here which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole some people put a matchstick toothpick piece of paper or something inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole s too big or has been stripped out i use a touch of elmer s glue screw in the straplock and let it sit for a day you have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn t work itself off the end use a socket to get the nut really tight new straps seem to be easier to secure i have a lot of high end instruments and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying this stuff is fantastic much better than lemon oil dries a lot cleaner and doesn t leave any oily residue on the board at all an hour after it s applied it sets up and doesn t get on your hands i apply it on occasion with the strings on i use elixirs and have never once had a problem the best few bucks you ll spend on guitar care stars the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended even though this has a lot of outlets each pedal may not receive enough power i usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok any more than that and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals may not power some pedals that have a high current draw i honestly don t know alot about guitar picks but they seem to get the job done no problems here i have been using the same one since i got them and have not broke it yet lol i purchased these for my little pedal board the stepping stone these are very well made with the heads well secured the plastic is thick and of a nice material the cables come with a massive year warranty so i m sure they re not going bad anytime soon buy with confidence works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too i bought these cable to use on a pedal board and they don t disappoint they re fairly flexible have solid construction and are different colors for easy identifying
157	hello i bought a epiphone goth studio guitar and i also bought this beauty i m very satisfied with the quality of this case as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected i ve bought a half dozen of these to keep in all my cases or gig bags sturdy stable and reliable not a big fan of fender accessories but they got this one right string trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts this item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars i tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady the locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in position the short extension in the picture is not on the unit i received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered i would purchase this unit again and again it is a good piece and a good deal when i was looking for a bass case i just wanted something that was not too expensive and would protect my bass this fits the bill perfectly it s not really a case that is meant for heavy travel like checking it a the airport but it definitely will take good care of your bass during normal travel and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc for the price this is an excellent case the price was most definately the main draw i am very glad that i placed the order these people are pleasant to work with don t let the term nylon fool you this is a really nice thick strap nothing like those cheap straps a great value and it matches my guitar that has a cool retro s pinstripe flame paintjob its very easy to install and are very effective in locking the strap to the guitar holds it in place and are of high quality material i recommend it a lot i m an enthusiastic amateur which means i care about my gear but it s not my living i buy the best gear i can afford but i can t go all mogami for every cable i need planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior can pay these sound good by that i mean they don t have any sound at all and are made well the design is such that they will wear well i m very pleased with these when this arrived i didn t realize it was that small thought it has to be so its out of the way then i thought this thing can t work very well but it does perfectly the first few times a used it i wasn t expecting muchhowever i couldn t more wrong it really works well and i would recommend this to family or friends the issue isn t whether it sounds exactly like a tube screamer the issue for me at least is does it sound good is it musical does it sound like an overdriven amp i say it does it sounds great for blues and rock i ve only had it for a couple weeks and i hope that it continues to work well for a long time i ve heard that these can be fragile but i m pretty gentle with my gear if it breaks i ll post about it it might just be my pickups or my strings but if you set the bass above seven or so the bass gets fairly fizzy on the e string the effects loop is useless and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals but that s good news because with this amp you don t need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive so if you ever do use a driven distorted tone you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp i just can t trust it i thought it d be a good idea if i needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute but i just can t get myself to do it i always end up using a little fender portable stand it does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp
158	another item never received but i would not use anything over mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase works as advertised the cutter makes this thing really worth while if i lose it i m buying another more words required sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings use it on acoustic and electric always lose them before i ever wear them out i dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker i thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk because well these days you usually get even a little less than what you pay for but this tuner destroyed those expectations its a small smart tuner so many functions and just a great design its really cool that i dont have to go hunt down a tuner that could be lost in my room somewhere this attached to basically any guitar or almost any object for that matter the only thing negative i have to say is im not so sure you can plug a cable into it which you would expect with all the other stuff it comes with otherwise its pretty great it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell if you can wait a month for delivery or longer if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up if you have over a guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too i have decided to build my own
159	this switch does work but you should look before you leap the switch travel is greater than it is for a standard way switch and if you use the common fender replacement control plate or one that was only intended for a way switch it may not fit you could fairly easily alter the plate but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate this metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it it is so durable filled with options very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician i have a vox ac tv it uses stock a ax but i thought i would try the at just to see what happened i had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom after a little test run my first impression was that the amp was noticeably quieter with this tube installed it might have reduced the volume by a third or more but this came with the benefit of the amp being noticeably less noisy that was a nice benefit i didn t notice much of a change tonally i think this tube basically brought the volume down i wouldn t say this is better or worse than the ax just quieter and with significantly less output i ended up switching back to the ax my issue with the pedaltrain is the accommodation of a power supply i have a voodoo lab pedal power plus the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply however if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested you re in for an unpleasant surprise first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board the fitment to the power supply is there sort of there s no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain are slightly too close together i wasn t worried about this since i doubt i ll ever chain them and only have access to outlet the second issue is the allegedly self tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter once you ve got them in or attempted to do so they re never coming out you ll probably have to break them it s a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board it can only go one place you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don t fit the mounting location on this board you can t plug them in because there s not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own but given that it doesn t fit like it s supposed to i wish i could return this board except i can t because it now has holes drilled in it you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it basically i paid for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro needless to say i m not very pleased
160	good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone most metal pedals do and is moderately noisy if you are looking for classic rock sounds you won t find them here can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for i find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords for the price this pedal is a good deal though it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board if that s not a problem definitely worth the price in particular i favor the dual design why if the need arises it s possible to use a regular strap that doesn t have the button locks installed i have two of the black ones on a string ibanez rg and laguna le qbc guitars i have spare straps for both guitars and sometimes i lock those spares with the plastic dunlop discs i have some older bass guitars with similar dunlop locks the standard version two of which had locks installed in the mid s and one from with the gold dd all three of them have held up with no issues i didn t need to re tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago then again i don t tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as metallica
161	it works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power the portable feature is great also just what i wanted if you have really large or heavy speakers you might want to consider professional grade stands but these will work fine for any speakers under lbs or so maybe more if you keep them lower down they look nice and are easily worth their selling price they do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers so you ll have to figure out what you need and buy those things separately wow a bench that really holds my ass what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand and it was necessary to the group what can you say about something that you need but is really insignificant in the scheme of things i needed it and it works simple as that after having played the yamaha ypg key portable grand piano keyboard in a showroom and loving it i was torn wondering what all i would be missing out on if i went with the more economically priced ypg i now own the and it appears as if i am missing out on twelve keys that is i am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer s remorse after opting for the cheaper this is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than i will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality of course my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as i will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited as such it might be best to say that for a novice one could not ask for a better instrument for the price so what is the difference between the and the based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences first is the obvious fact that the possesses keys while the has the also includes a stand sustain pedal and power adapter which must be purchased separately for the while i am unaware of the specifics the also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices beyond these definitive differences having now played both models the also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly why buy the ypg if price is not an issue go ahead and get he it is a beautiful instrument however for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need keys purchase the like the the possesses piano style graded soft touch gst keys which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted the feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability the like the also features usb connectivity and general midi compatibility as well as almost all of the same high quality voices which separate both the and the from many other models in their price brackets besides the pianos the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic while it is unfortunate that yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the theyamaha survival kit d accessory kit for yamaha ypg ypg keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor extended warranty and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply in my opinion the ypg offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck again the sounds great feels great and is hard to beat for the price
162	i ve had this pedal for over a year now and i ve been getting more and more into tube amps and i ve learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together amps guitars and pedals when i first reviewed this pedal i had just gotten a new solid state amp and i was very let down after i jumped to tube amps i grew to appreciate it a little bit more but i was using it wrong i d just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a nd channel gain stage i thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing but i dismissed it as just an ok box flash forward this thing kills it belongs in front of a tube amp period i ve found as all before me that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state amps the d iii works very well as a clean boost max the volume set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back this will blast your clean amp into overdrive without much coloration on your tone this is my preferred setting as i can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like i would before using it as a second channel but with that natural tube sound any pedal that gives you some more umph without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thing dial the output down some and crank the volume on the amp a bit more the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone i found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer while not tonally identical this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy heavy tones while retaining the sound of the amp s natural distortion in between you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive after playing around with the knobs i found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal i actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as that s been done to death the d iii is conceptually the same but it just sounds different that the ts and it doesn t let go of the low end for the price this is a fantastic buy it delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost and there s enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone you d want save for modern high gain metal i play in our band at church and as such i ve been wanting a vox ac for quite some time for those of you who do not play contemporary christian music and are wondering what the heck i m talking about let s just say that it s an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music you must utilize a vox tone because of u i know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it anyway for the past few years i ve been utilizing a line floor pod plus to achieve this tone i ve been using the class a sound which is close and quite useable but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and i ve never found a way around that i just sort of dealt with it then came father s day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used vox ac c and i love everything about it doing a little research it seems that its predecessor ac cc was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners well the ac c implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that s awesome right out of the box i ve seen some people complain about the fact that it s a pcb inside and not hand wired and that it s made in china so what it sounds very nice especially for the low price the amp s overdrive is very rich with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume i cranked it to in my living room and was quire loud for a w amp but not window shattering loud in a church setting this is obviously not an option fortunately you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy vox tone just at a more manageable level you need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the top boost and normal channels i ve opted to just use the normal channel and push it with a joyo ultimate drive pedal which by the way is the most impressive overdrive pedal you ll ever hear that overdrive does not interfere with the vox tone at all i used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with dimarzio hs series pickups and the joyo pedal pushing the amp and it was classic vox chime all the way i also used a boss dd delay also required if you play in a christian band same reason as the other thing i mentioned pure tone heaven some have noted noise or hiss problems with this amp which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes mine did not have this problem actually i thought it did and i was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before i realized that it was the way i had the amp set up as i stated earlier this is a channel amp normal and top boost but which one you re using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into i was plugged into the normal channel and didn t realize that the top boost volume was dimed and that s where the hiss was coming from i just shut that volume completely off since i was not using the top boost channel anyway problem solved i m amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice i ve owned marshalls mesa boogies a laney a music man and other oddball tube amps over the years some costing several times the cost of the vox ac c and the vox can hold its own with those others think of it as an affordable boutique amp if you can pick one up used like i did all the better interestingly enough this amp was advertized as a used vox ac with no indication of whether it was a c or a cc fortunately it was a c it s a value at full price also get one i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds this was my first fender amp as well the presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how it s clean sound was the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max the master volume was at and no effects were turned on i ve never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts this isn t a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond it s clearly a defect with this product dirty pre sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume you d think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy hiss at low levels wtf the next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note there s a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp file at a low bit rate and frequency whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable the weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but i m not going to be stuck playing a watt amp through my pc or cans i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted celestion speaker read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar amp related websites there s a page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and you ll find that these amps are having issues apparently the mustang i and ii don t have these issues and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesn t seem to care definitely try this before you buy it you may get an amp that doesn t have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds good this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage i am disappointed that fender hasn t yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong but i m not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrong whatever i took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the built in noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and i picked up a watt marshall instead guess what the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked how about that even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noise i ll knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that i d like to try but before i buy another fender amp i ll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds
163	it s hard to beat the quality of monster cables there is absolutely no discernible loss of tone through this cable i love it quality is there in construction and signal passing we never have problems with our monster gold cables conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x champ it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender it sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings great replacement and a definite upgrade makes the champ a super champ this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while cleans up your gear s appearance tremendously very easy to use and lots of extra cable length i ve tried every gimmicky thing you can imagine and have always gone back to what simply works these dunlop tortex mm picks i ve tried different brands shapes and sizes and they all just get in the way these aren t slick like some of the others they stay in my hand and they wear ok as long as i don t get too wild and if i ever do drop one they show up super easy on the floor due to their bright yellow color i would be lost if they quit making these or changed them any hopefully they don t these are great i m an enthusiastic amateur which means i care about my gear but it s not my living i buy the best gear i can afford but i can t go all mogami for every cable i need planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior can pay these sound good by that i mean they don t have any sound at all and are made well the design is such that they will wear well i m very pleased with these
164	plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a lepai amp not much else i can tell you maybe a little bigger than i m comfortable with but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things they keep disappearing any size wuhan china sounds great this little inch model is high pitched but has that trashy wuhan sound i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china i m a gadget lover and this is a good one it makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument this stand is very good nice and strong i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this it is worth a lot more then dollars this will last a life time and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash so i looked for something better and i am so happy to have found this at this price i didn t want to pay more then dollars for a stand but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for or dollars and in months its in the trash i would be buying another one so really this is the best deal i am so happy i bought this stand you can t go wrong with this one realy get it it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over its heavy enough not to it slides up and down nicely and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well bolts are not plastic witch is nice and very easy to put together and fast i got it together in one minute i only used regular pliers to put it together the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument i truly recommend this for anyone i did get the foot guards for to protect floor on carpet you will not need them and it comes with a year warranty and with the free shipping you can t beet it at the time i bought was mine arrived broken so it had gone back reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken not upset about that stuff happens it is just not a good stand light construcion unstable topples easily and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped the protective materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft shiny runner like materail and it sticks to my instrument s neck so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity happened every time yes i tried out the stand even though broken and it proved to be a bad choice back it has gone stars to amazon s return policy thouh
165	this is good cable excellent plugs the lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material which will hold everything in place for years grade a cable at a very affordable price definitely going back for more the ft cable was only a couple dollars more than ft they costed twice as much as my usual d addarios but after weeks of use i couldn t be any happier i ve heard only positive reviews about these elixir strings and now understand why they are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright clean and crisp they also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier a great buy overall my rhythm guitar player recently dropped and broke his sg because of no strap locks i bought him a set of these i use them because unless you standardize you need a separate strap for every set of locks this eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair having feet of xlr xlr m f cables that can be used any way i want e g ea foot for stereo foot for mono or ea foot for multichannel work is very flexible the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord white to store them when not in use as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job i ended up using all of the cords for mics and amplified speakers plus another of their foot cables for interconnect you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters these end pins are so simple and logical that i m surprised it s taken the design process this long to get to this point i used to use schaller straplocks but they re not compatible with all straps if the end leather material is too thick the lock won t fit i enjoy the elliptical endpin design as it helps me feel confident the strap will stay on but i can easily remove the strap or use another on the guitar i highly recommend you try this out if you re looking for a great way to keep your strap secured
166	i ve had this cable for awhile and i m not too impressed with the quality the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin i use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn t had much of a workout i don t think it would hold up long on stage at a venue i have always used d addario strings since the early s when i first found out they were manufactured right here on long island i ve never been disappointed by the quality use it with an sm shure mic in a studio type application holds up great mic does not slip upside down sideways bought stand as a gift for my son s acoustic guitar he loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand can t go wrong for the price speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet these hold up great year round i will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don t fall onto my baby grand
167	this is a fantastic product that is well made the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition the tool is extremely useful i have just started playing with a band and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in with the wheel i immediately know what chords to choose from i also know what notes are in each chord in addition it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys for example say you re playing the i iv and v chords in the key of c but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb find out the new i iv and v chords and start playing the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair this is a very useful product at a fair price no i am not affiliated with the company at all i m just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool in my opinion this is a five star product the description says it all but i was still wondering if i made the right choice because i was comparing the fender accessories guitar tools what the heck kind of name is that anyway with no reviews to thejim dunlop nc formula neck cradle maintenance stationthat had some pretty good reviews well i cannot speak for the dunlop but i can say that this kit is light weight self contained has storage space in it and it works if the guitar is face up or face down it also has pad to keep your guitar from sliding and the pad keeps the neck rest in place so it does not topple over i do not see anything like that mentioned in the dunlop nc on top of it i think the neck rest pad inguitar setup maintenance instructional guitar dvd with denny rauenis this one turned over so the fender logo is not showing this is a very high quality strap the supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship however i don t like the plastic end pieces they are large and well plastic so i m sending it back i m going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapprotec guitar strap with leather ends and pick pocket blackand straplocksschaller security locks nickelfor about the same price this is mainly a matter of personal preference if you don t mind the plastic end pieces this is a beautiful strap i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass these things work really great i love them
168	if you are familiar with shubb s they are by far the best capo you can get some people do like the big close pin but if you don t buy a shubb this works just as stated now i can plug my mic in either way and it gives me more versitility this stand after i finally figured out how to attach it so that it didn t interfere with the boom on my mic stand works okay due to its heaviness it does hold a good size amount of music however it is short width wise so you can t really get an open notebook to stay in place at least not with the mic boom there heavy to travel with also so i don t know how much i ll use it this is actually quite good no problems after seasons of work and the neutrik knock off connectors plug into devices well the funny thing is they don t connect that easily to each other like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run but a little finagling will get them to mate i m not one to cheap out on a lot of things but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays i m not saying there isn t a place for high quality cables but if you have jobs were you don t need cables made of pure spun angel s pubic hair these will get the job done
169	i love the tortex mm picks red i have one that s over years old and still going strong yes the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings i use the red yellow and orange tortex s exclusively for practice and performance i m a church worship leader my highest recommendation especially for the price this is a great buy the strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when i would slide up and down the fretboard and i was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too the only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren t shining like they use to i just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure i wiped it in off as thoroughly as possible which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as i went from fret to fret not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing the ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever take minutes and do you and your guitar a favor not much to say here but is really nice to have around hold my picks tight and has them where i need them i expected this to be a good mic but it s amazing how much different the quality is over your standard desk mic
170	this is a great pedal i picked up used they can be had cheaply on the used market i actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit the eq pots on the front panel make it very versatile enough to use with a cigar box guitar also the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eq d for saturated distortion the other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular i also other boss distortion pedals like most people i own a ds and an md which are both cheap and effective i own a hm heavy metal which caters more to the traditional metal sound and i actually think this pedal is more versatile imo with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone i also own an older s hm heavy metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that i could never part with overall i like this pedal but it cannot top the older legendary boss pedals i bought this pedal used and have used it with both a fender tube amp and a marshall solid state using clean channels i can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection while i have several overdrive pedals this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end i can get decent tones from a telecaster and les psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below o clock and adjusting the drive to taste the od sounds great through fender clean tubes and i also tried it with a bass guitar with some adjustment of the tone and drive knob the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive the other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic boss in build quality i find the boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones i ve owned after some time but i may keep this one as is and use it as a boost these pedals last forever and i only paid for mine originally i purchased a behringer eq equalizer pedal for my rig it was cheap at around some change but like the other reviewers noted it s noisy with hiss so i took the advice of another reviewer bought the fish chips model by danaelectro and it s terrific i plugged it directly in line on my skb pedal board turned them both on turned on the amp put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max no discernible hiss nor hum mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable this pedal has a cool s style appearance it has a great punch when you raise up the level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar amp sounds for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the price tag if you re in the market for a great band eq pedal then you ll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one this product rates out of possible stars i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites the sound i get from the ad g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp the strings seem to hold up well i cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle these strings sound great i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing my review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones i bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars the cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage one complaint i have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my spector bass securely but works with the others flawlessly i use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues i also use spectraflex fatso flex cables and mogami and think that this one is worth it s price to me the warranty is worth it because of the price i reead all over the web about the opinions of monster s patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality but there are more expensive cables out there made by mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar metallic silver sizeand what a difference in sound these strings seriously rock i also use d addario strings on my ukulele and i ve had great luck with those they withstand a lot of play and i don t have to replace them often the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder definitely recommended i have a taylor ga e the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright i tried some martins ej s which i love on my seagull s however those strings just didn t have enough bass and too much highs i bought these recently and i love them they are much better then the original strings very rich bass that really comes out the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have now off to buy some different bridge materials edit i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow every time i come back to it after several weeks i forget that i put the ls on it then i pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are john pearse strings worth every penny great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars soft touch easy care can t beat it i read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price i usually use dr tite fits but these made me change for good they have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with p s i also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar i built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup i will buy another set dr strings never disappoint this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice so please buy it if you want i ve been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the s they give me a sense of security knowing that my guitar strap is totally secured to my guitar i consider it cheap insurance herco is a jim dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part i wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward i may order another if this one performs well these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well as other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it s not abused i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects i have found that the delay works well around percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay i don t know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves it s purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some eq tinkering i found a good mix of echo i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d and thought it would be a good idea again danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp i bought this wax and compared it to meguiars i ve been using for years and it surpasses meguiars by miles i have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also i like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply along with a few high end guitars i also have a few beaters i used this wax on an old squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great i use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly i overdid it with an older les paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease i will buy this stuff again and again my local guitar shop sells this for the same price i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul i have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the hercules the stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs there is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands i can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place i strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there the extra cost is well worth the investment i bought this at my local guitar shop for after looking into it the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while i was there update a few weeks ago i bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers i usually buy locally but the deal here was great the stand is worth the price and more i bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after uses the wood looks great again i used the honey twice in days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition this honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier i saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after i bought this but i do not use it much so it should last a long time this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended i thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big it really doesn t affect play at all so it doesn t matter this strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed i have these straps on all my gear very well made will last a lifetime instead of shelling out over for a line a c adapter for my pocket pod i decided to give this one a try out and i m glad i did it s well made works great and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process can t beat this one for sure i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster planet waves has built its company making affordably priced accessories and these patch cables are no exception i bought these at a local guitar center for about the same price the thickness and connectors seems to hold up well although i may look for a slimmer alternative soon as some other reviewers have stated also that the connector ends are a bit large and could become difficult to work with in smaller or crowded pedalboards i like the tuner and i m definitely keeping it but the polyphonic aspect of it is pretty useless when you tune using the needle or led version of a needle it will show each string as being in tune then when you strum and use the polyphonic mode it often shows some strings are out and that s even when i use the neck pick up and strum with my thumb as the manual says to do but the tuner works great in the single string mode and i also like the drop d setting and the easy way to switch between the modes it also has very cool and easy ways to adjust the hz pitch and it is very easy to switch to eb tunings and other settings i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting that is a very cool feature for those folks who still use batteries to power their pedals the tuner works great and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting so buy it but do it because the price is right and it works great as a tuner in the traditional sense not because of the polyphonic gimmick august edit as follows i just found out a feature of this pedal that i definitely do not like i dislike it so much i had to edit my review i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat so i set the tuner to the e flat setting as explained in the manual then i tried to tune all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning i wrote the manufacturer they did get back to me quickly and they explained that the drop tuning functions only work in polytune mode so if you re like me and you find that polytune doesn t work very well then basically all this is is a standard needle chromatic tuner that will not tune in any other drop modes lame
171	i m in love with the dual design system it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly there is one downside to this system as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time one component which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren t much help either the directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go but i didn t know the name of the piece nor could i readily find it in there after that i installed this into my new guitar and strap and i was ready to go i highly recommend this it is much easily to switch out straps w o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process i think tortex delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by durable good to gripping surface easy to identify thicknesses by color the only way i can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better take a look at cactus picks to get an idea of what i mean i m not sure what else to say the picks work well and they don t wear out easily i like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they don t slide out i ve used d addario strings for bass electric acoustic and classic even though this string was my first time use and it haven t failed me yet it s very stable and in tune all time while playing highly recommand to other ppl i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner so i gave this to him to save some time first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing now it s time to treat myself with this gift so i don t have to do what my leader did during band practice i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china it s very rare thing to see now a days
172	i needed a new strap but i didn t want to pay for one i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot i m glad i did the strap is awesome it s very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i ve ever had it totally deserves stars nice sturdy construction for the most part although i don t like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends but for the price you get what you pay for i would have much better liked it if they were metal i put this on my les paul and it fit good but i decided it was not the look i wanted on that guitar so i put it on my bc rich instead the bc rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar so when i adjusted the length to a comfortable position the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back i ll give it a try for a while but i think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare great little amp i replaced a year old fender chorus with this no comparison i have it below on the volume and it is still loud the factory setup is great but you can set it up anyway you want it
173	the winder works really well and same with the cutter but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome i guess for taking w you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool but if using at home then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter that s what i do anyway still i think is a good tool to have hold a tune very well and sound good the seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge but thats ok if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long but i always do and i change strings often so that isnt an issue for me overall some of the best strings available good design good price smart locking mechanism great for classic accustic and light electric guitars good sound very very low noise except on high gain when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half expensiveif you re planing to record on computer buy a usb mixer for the same price you ll get a lot of stuff and a mixerworks with ios if you have an external power supply powered hub
174	i am a beginner guitarist i am happy with this capo it works good and that is all i need the fit and finish seems like quality also i purchased a pack of the soft rubber wedgie s as an add on to a larger order as such i found them to be a reasonable value however i m not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic i think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or uke they are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort i love the very soft warm sound they provide i use them mostly late at night when i can t sleep and want to play but the rest of the family is still sleeping not quite as effective on the e a and d steel strings but certainly playable not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords thanks spo this ac adapter in my opinion should not even qualify to be reviewed since we all know it should be included with the product it is powering that being said it functions as it was intended to which is to power a yamaha psre key portable keyboard it fits perfectly and stays put all while transmitting electrical current from my home s v outlet into the aforementioned yamaha keyboard thanks for reading spo i bought this intending to use it on my seagull acoustic but tonight i put it on my squier fat strat instead after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap which was about the same price just because it had fender embroidered on it was making my neck when i put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap so i decided to sign in and write this review this strap is softer and better made than the poly ones it even comes with a string tie for your acoustic which you might need consider taking my advice treat yourself for a strap when guitars cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars is not much besides the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe the only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegs i use c type snap on strap locks but they will no longer fit maybe i ll see if the venerable grolsch strap locks will work you can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on sale update too snug for grolsch strap locks on the squier also ordered these large picks and like others mentioned they are not large at all i have average size hands and thumbs and the pick initially numbed my thumb in about twenty seconds it was so tight i solved the problem by simply holding a bic lighter flame about a half inch away from the heel of the pick for just about three seconds i could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly it was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit it s actually easy to completely customize the size and shape of the picks with just a few seconds of heat the picks fit fine now and i didn t even need to place foreign objects into the microwave to do it any questions just feel free to ask and i will answer best i can thanks spo i ve owned a bunch of tuners over the past years and this one is the best i ve ever had for an acoustic guitar it is easy to operate has a nice large display that you can easily see and it s small enough to carry anywhere it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever nothing to complain about here stars all the way
175	i acknowledge that this is a minority opinion perhaps i just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards but while i loved the sound and functionality of this wah wah pedal it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable i suspected that the potentiameter was shot so i had that replaced but the same problems reoccurred like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it good product but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit i had i have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups some peope miss the quack electric guitar type sound from these other types i do not i also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified nor is any battery required i run it through a baggs para acoustic preamp or my fishman aura it really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly product was delivered safely and promptly it works well of the time but sometimes has a problem with the g string for me i use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together they re fail safe the snark tuner will also get buggy once in a while but together it s so statistically unlikely that i don t worry about it the stomp tuner also has the benefit of being able to hault the signal hence why i wouldn t just use a snark tuner ive used this on guitars acoustic and electric ukuleles banjos banjo ukeleles violins and mandolins no issues well except that sometimes it rattles quietly it doesn t effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune that s not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time and i hate how that looks anyway i love the little thing my only complaint is that like all other clip on tuners that i ve had it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally and will then wear out the battery
176	this hosa cable is very well made with good quality connectors and a nice long length my son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected this cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable highly recommended cfh i don t know if they are the best haven t tried them all but from what i ve tried none are better d addarios are top quality and very reasonably priced my choice for string or string acoustics this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume the pickup is very over sensitive also spend some time where exactly you place the pickup it makes a big difference try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something i had an issue with my new squire guitar and fender hooked me up with a set of these the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end rather then the typical small loop the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity i say they sound great and are worth trying i just order packs so i can have some on hand works amazingly so far i am definitely proud of this product will be buying more in the future great buy
177	we all know it s just a container with a sponge in it no biggie i bought it to get super saver shipping on something else and because i plan to keep an all solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings but it should do the job i had always used the kyser clip on the top capos and still do but i liked the look on this dunlop clip on the bottom model it works great and looks better nothing sounds as bright as these strings i ve tried many and these are the best by far i know cause i play em geetar real good like i thought i could take the smell i couldn t otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding the case is nice too but everything smells like the chinese rubber smell at harbor freight tools sulfur i tried airing it out for a week with no success if you have no sense of smell get one the tuner is perfect for me it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair always spot on with the frequency nice product works like it is suppose to good quality i am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song thank you kyser capos i bought this to try out on my baritone uke it works great and is very easy to use i use it with my fender mustang i had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my martin dx i was able to attach it to the smoother hpl back and sides using the suction cup i wet it before attaching you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc for trouble mounting it could be used on just about any instrument some may need a clamp it picks up anything it is attached to it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp pretty cool nice price these work great for the price i bought a couple intending to use them on a diddley bow i built i have not used them for that purpose yet but tried them on my guitars a dulcimer and stick i built and was impressed with the sound quality for the price
178	this is a fine bag for a guitar i got it for my brother i m not a music person but its good looks really cool and sounds great no buzz or unwanted noise with these cables and they have a velcro strap which makes it easy to store them when you are done i like them a lot i don t know much about guitar tuners but i am sure you can pay for a more expensive one but this one does the job it was not hard to figure out how to use it and the fender is a happier guitar for it i am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar but i purchased this sn to replace the piece of junk first tuner i had i m very happy with the size of the sn it s small much smaller than i expected which was a big bonus it takes up very little room on the headstock and does not interfere when i make tuning adjustments the chip clip style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my ibanez acoustic and i think my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner the user interface is very simple and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions the instruction manual is adequate but the sn seemed very intuitive for me to use the product arrived on time as shown well packaged for what i believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change i ve had this sn for a couple months now and will update this review down the road thanks for reading and if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will do the best i can to answer spo i suppose it does what it is suppose to do it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if i want to spend more bucks for a better one
179	the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar my daughter loves it instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice installs in minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs i m new to acoustic so i m not too sure how things go but from what i have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good a little to thick for my style though they make a very deep and loud noise i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic they sound much better and aren t quite as loud i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present so far so good you can t beat the price thanks i noticed an immediate improvement in my playing as this tuner above all others i have tried korg intellitune etc brings your instrument into dead on ringing true tune across the instrument i use this on my fender stratocaster gibson les paul custom fender telecaster fender stratacoustic and takaminie classical works equally well meaning phenomenally well on all of my guitars with all of the features capo tune visual metronome acoustic as well as vibration tuning plus calibration this is one tuner you won t want to be without and the only one you need
180	almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys when i put them on i felt confident that i wouldn t have that issue anymore it s easier to strap up because of the quick release tab this should be every bassist guitarist s best friend love these they re sturdy which is very important and was my biggest concern since my guitars are pretty heavy they look so cool on the wall and everyone compliments and noticed my guitars now love this so much highly recommended the planet waves classic series ft instrument cable is basic but works great and is very flexible seems sturdy enough to last a long time very nice quality part fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed but my mexi strat is now complete replaced my old bridge assembly with this new one and it really brought the strat back to life in terms of looks and feel also this was priced right in my opinion this amp is a quality item for the dollar range i paid there is some question about sound quality and variation in quality we purchased two of these and one arrived with some minor issues constant humming regardless of volume or eq settings amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem this is not a w stage amp nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors it has a full punch output at full gain volume and can easily light up a back yard specs input mono not a tip and ring jack controls volume gain and selectable volume eq range knobs there are two volume controls once for each side of the push button selector outputs mono for monitor or mixer dual mono headphone jack tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel power lighted front panel rocker switchthe box is very slim and small about a foot by a foot and deep the rear is partially open speaker exposed and allows for cord storage pros portability easy of use and set up quality finish leatherette with steel corners and good construction heavy duty lead guitar speaker excellent sound and electronics for any amp under there are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are more go with this one cons units run hot and cold as to quality but if it works out of the box it s good if not you ll know it as soon as you power it up buy with confidence at amazon from amazon and you shouldn t have any worries these amps power two squier tm by fender electric guitarssquier by fender bullet strat with tremolo bundle with strings pick card and polishing cloth black rosewood fretboardand do a great job other accessories for the beginner electric to consider cords hosa gtr guitar cable ft planet waves classic series instrument cable feetstrap planet waves polypropylene guitar strap blackstraplocks dunlop dual design straplok system nickelhanger string swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary
181	these are really great guitar locks i use them on all my guitars and i would highly recommend them to anyone there are several types of practice amps high end modlers line g dec vox vt that can still run and are typically overloaded with features the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v peavey valveking etc these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality and then there are the micros i always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas boy was i wrong i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear he s not a big kid so even lb amps are pushing it plus a gig bag and school back pack that was initially what brought me to the micro not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso turns out this is an amazing amp the tone destroys the line and the features crush the vox pathfinder watt or bug v and the fender frontman not even in the ballpark each of the models are distinct the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate obviously this isn t a loud amp but that s not all bad you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes it also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously for example i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy don t let the size fool you i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i couldn t have been more wrong there are several big websites and it s tough to find any negatives about this amp quality sounding and durable for a great price oh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too item arrived as described and on time way larger than expected but my son loved it says it s easier to use than the smaller cloths we ve gotten before if you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar when you are upgrading your fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold fender jack plate i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture it is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
182	completely quite connected with no problem i own two these strings are beyond amazing switching to ernie ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar and if you do any blues playing at all extra slinkies are for you they bend and bend and bend are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos and give a great sound whether you re playing gritty or bright i also play country and punk and these strings let me get enough twang and beef respectively to play those styles as well the best you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put ernie ball strings on your guitar every guitarist needs a good tuner and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend usd for a tuner when i received this unit i decided first thing i was going to do was to compare it to my other hand held chromatic tuners they all work the same using this pedal i am able to obtain the same results that s good enough for me activating the tuner takes a little over seconds but that s fine since i usually tune within breaks and you hardly need to tune especially when you have a good guitar tuning pegs this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price one does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesn t know which in or output is actually making the interference but once you ve established that it s all good baby this is a clone of the boss compressor and works just as well as far as i have been able to tell as the original being the owner of both i would have to say if you re not too stuck up about brands then i would go with this if you like the boss cs but many people say that bosses compressor is not that good i know some compressors do seem to be a little more natural sounding however that is just preference it does what it needs to chicken picking or just crispening up your sound its plastic but nothing is unbreakable so use some sense don t hit it with a hammer or jump on it and you ll not break it i ve had no problems with behringer but heard great things the cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow
183	for a cheap eq it does great sometimes though when i hit the switch the light turns on and there is a second before the signal comes back if it was not for that it would be a star rating i am not too worried about it because the pedal loop pedal is still cheaper then the mxr or boss eq s i like the sound of this pedal and the ability to get the right over drive sound i want i ve used it with my reissue s fender strat plugged into my vintage marshal watt head and a slanted cab love the sound i am also using this pedal with my ibanez gb arch top jazz guitar and i am amazed with how good of an over drive i can get i ve also owned a tube screamer but i like this one better how much can you say about a patch cable this is a good one at a good price i recommend it too much noise with one spot this was way better lot of feature outlets can all be used to power either v or v pedals for each outlet just use the voltage selector switches to choose the voltage you need plug in your pedal and go outlet works the same way and gives you a similar choice except that it s between v and v outlets and may only be used one at a time if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise like outlets outlet gives you a choice between v and v outlet is a v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power isolated outputs delivering ma each centre pin is negative ac output at connector will power all pedals most of my pedals are to ma so potentially i could have plus pedals in a chain awesomeall the cables you needlike all t rex fuel tank power supplies your new chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter free once you ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play excellent don t even think about it just get it highly recommend it in my opinion this thing is well worth the price gives great overdriven tube amp sound versatile for of music not for bone crushing metal the knobs work fine but do not seem to roll off or not very sensitive precise full range achieved from to noon
184	i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely tuned them down to a sharp b flat and they sounded sweet back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone i compared this cable to the monster studio pro cable i also own i prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it i got replacememts over years worth the higher price because of the warranty the dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording note this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it every guitar i ve ever cared about has had this strap on it i must ve bought about of these over my lifetime and i don t regret it even in the slightest
185	i have used dunlop straplocks for years i bought the original style years ago for my strat les paul and partscaster the last two having the most weight these things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem i ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out it was on the strap i used the most for the heavier guitars so i got some mileage out of that thing i ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar i suggest these over the other brands watch what touring bands use these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch if you happen to be without a strap with locks on it these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping as a beginner guitarist a few friends let me try out their picks i was displeased with most of the standard picks partially because i didn t like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn t sound quite as robust as i like hopefully that makes sense however when i was handed one of these it produced a pleasant sound and i didn t feel like i would somehow break the pick while playing needless to say now that i have my own guitar i ordered a pack of these and i am certainly not disappointed i play progressive and thrash metal and these strings hold out nicely tuned them down to a sharp b flat and they sounded sweet back up to e standard and they provide nice full sounding tone this is a great glass slide but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced my finger stays too tight not uncomfortable but it takes some effort to get it out gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings think alice in chains or really distorted live nirvana solo admittedly not everyone s into the whole grunge tone but it was what i was looking for has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too and hey you can pretty much get it for pocket change its cheap it worx what more to say welp only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it d be perfect nope i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt dblow on bruthas n sistas doc p let me start by saying that i never even opened these i ve given it a star merely out of respect for hohner i have no clue how they play so you ll have to look at other review for that info i ordered this product based on the fact that the description states includes a deluxe red pro type hard shell case well not from music it doesn t when i asked music about this they said oh well we provide amazon with our catalogue and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items really not only did this not come in the red case which i didn t really care about anyway it didn t come in any version of this case style which i was interested in the case that s shown is the case that s sold individually on many sites for so i figured wow what the heck i m getting harmonicas that cost a piece if puchased individually and i m getting a case with them you d be silly not to bite on that right well they came in a cheaper nondescript black zipper case not the one with the hohner logo on it save your money and order this through musicians friend it s the same price free shipping and you get the actual item as it s described on their site in closing it s been a week since i sent this product back to music and i still have not received my refund do yourself a favor and avoid them was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal especially a delay for this price but i figured how can you go wrong if it s not good at least you re not out a lot of money i ve been thoroughly impressed with this pedal much more sturdy than it appears in photos i actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it works great so far and don t regret purchasing worth every dime where else can you get a great functioning delay pedal for this price
186	good microphone for the money sounds a little better than my akg d s knocked it down to stars due to the fact it does not have an on off switch i am a user of behringer products though own of their amps so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use it is well made and i would buy it again if needed
187	how a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesn t seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what i like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isn t always possible with that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding jim dunlop s purple colored big stubby mm picks i like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the big stubby certainly meets that criteria the sharp point and the pick s rounded edges help the stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking besides electric guitar i find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semi solid body guitars where the string tension is greater i had tried the mm stubby previously but the mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all i m still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly i find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky keeping the pick clean and dry does help my favorite pick had been thedunlop mm nylon pick but i am very pleased with the performance and feel of the mm stubby i can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick the pick pack contains picks i only paid which is simply an outstanding deal if you re a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty stubby a try they work great you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings i use these on an old gibson semi hollow body perfect size and does it s job had one pick inside as a place holder stick tape holds it anywhere you want it cheap and easy there are better tuners out there far better this could be good but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there and they don t even tune it well to standard especially when tuning the g string i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open tunings on an acoustic this piece of junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using f or c notes i have no clue as to why that is pretty stupid if you ask me especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d bags i say that with love that play in open tunings trust me your money is best spent elsewhere i wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself i wanted to like it but unfortunately it just isn t my thing i played it all but weeks until i got bored and stopped it now sits on my amp collecting dust i pick it up occasionally but i always end up putting it back down shortly after i am sorry i just can t dig it edit so apparently a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post normally i d just laugh at these no lifers but i am sick of getting constant e mails from internet tough guys so i d like to formally state that this is not a bad product it can be fun but the effects it gives are not worth and its build quality is not worth like i said in the original post i became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed the last time i picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout active pickups on my schecter its not that i didn t know how to use it like one of the morons in the comments section stated this product requires very little skill to use read the manual if you are having trouble it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this device would i recommend it if you have a hundred bucks to drop go for it if not your money is best spent elsewhere
188	good strings with good sound the extra light is easier on the fingers but they sound thinner too go for the light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure i own ataylor guitars ce jumbo string acoustic electric guitarand it came with these strings on it string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time so they might not get as much use as a regular string the tone from these strings is just as bright and clear months later and they still hold their tuning like they after the first days elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use they are great strings on any guitar these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well color and appearance is a personal thing i think these abalone picks just look cool the color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone fender makes a nice standard pick the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy these mediums work well for playing electric guitar i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex those work well for acoustic i ve used dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the dava rubber coated picks they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick the gray dunlop s don t look anywhere near as cool as these at for a dozen they re worth a try it they don t work out for playing they sure look darn nice the fender logo is in gold dava grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey mm love the holder and the picks looke great and nice and i don t have to look around for my picks when i m ready to play my guitar very nice guitar slide the glass is nice slides very well on my electric and acoustic and it fits like a mitten it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later
189	i ve had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven t failed me once i love them and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so they rotate in full circles and are super durable you should buy them for all your guitars and you ll never have to worry again they are also very easy to use and install if there are still people out there who don t believe in magic just try this it has truly elevated my playing a few notches i d probably have bought another bottle already but this one seems to be lasting forever i ve had it a few months now i use it pretty much a few times everyday and it still seems full if after using this your playing doesn t improve then maybe you should give up guitar this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together using just one wall wart you can power all of them at least those that receive this kind of power v where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l converter cl for line products i have an m audio black box which had a peculiar size plug it was v ma but nothing would fit then i tried the l converter and bingo i m in business and black box bliss i would recommend having it around just for that it costs about the same as odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can t find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters a pedal junkies salvation this is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looper no complaints with this i bought a bunch of these when i started building my pedal board they re very inexpensive but seemingly quite high quality tons of bang for your buck seemingly no tone loss no added noise and no coloration the right angle ends are a little big and bulky they may not do so well on a tight and jam packed board but for average boards they work great i gig and record with these great product only negative check b c the ends are too bulky what a nice product rugged and well made the supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs i was able to build a pedal board with a tuner delay distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare it looks very neat and tidy using george l s makes it look even better i will buy one of these again these things rock edit still a great little board but i found power grip pedal board velcro this board that the new velcro make this an unstopable unit
190	i ve been using these straplocks for over years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot folks this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it s not going anywhere this is a must have just buy it i ve owned several inexpensive korg lcd tuners over the years like all of the others this one is excellent reliable and durable i keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs while the case is made of plastic the construction is solid and seems very durable my disappointment is with the sound i never could dial in a sound that made me feel like it enhanced the sound of my bass it was just different i ve switched to using the built in compressor in my digitech bp instead it is not that large and really organizes my instruments the only detriment is that i leave my instruments out and they tend to collect dust cover them with a sheet or something very very loud electric guitar amp as a bass player i was shocked that w could be that loud for guitar i can t raise the volume above in my house when you switch it to acoustic or bass mode the volume decreases dramatically but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally excellent top quality features beautiful sound for each of the different modes the acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar sound like it was an actual acoustic the amp simulation is top notch awesome value for the price edit i ve played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings i m even more impressed one of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero i brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and boom huge sound i play with a piece dance band and usually bring my hartke kickback for that group after experimenting more i would not hesitate to use the peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band i still can t get over the fact that it is a w amp the sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage a friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord lol the cord delivers good sound quality the only problem i have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy
191	i like these straplocks but they were a little tight to get on a levy s strap i did manage to get it on however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review if amazon used half stars i would have given them i just couldn t bring myself to give them a so i went with here s why i ve used standard medium picks for over years switching to these was not a problem at all sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems by far the biggest change was the pointy ness of the picks the distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing especially when playing chords everything is much more pronounced which isn t necessarily a good thing in my opinion it s especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming if someone was to ask me if these are good picks my answer would be it depends it really does in my opinion it depends on what you re playing from a rhythm standpoint i don t like these at all they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me for lead work they are ok because you can really dig into each note and have it come through could i play faster with them no could i pull off amazing licks that i couldn t do with my normal picks no i tried them but didn t like them maybe if you typically play a ton of lead work constantly these would be the way to go i don t and they aren t for me i m glad i tried them though because i ll never wonder again if they were for me to me the stock speaker that came with my fender blues deluxe reissue sounded too brittle even if i messed with the presence and eq knobs it just always accentuated the highs too much for me i had read reviews on this speaker and decided to pull the trigger and get one i haven t regretted the purchase i was hoping the improvement would be the same as when i put a ragin cagin in my fender super champ xd wasn t the case it did however fix the problem i purchased the speaker for my blues deluxe now sounds warmer to me and doesn t have that accentuated high end that it did before all in all it was a good upgrade and i d do it again slick i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x champ it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender it sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings great replacement and a definite upgrade makes the champ a super champ i have purchased six of these over the last couple years why because they work they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place i don t think i d ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall they feel rock solid too i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future i gave it stars because i haven t used any other devices like these before maybe there is something better but i haven t seen it yet slick the software itself sound interface starsthe installation and activation starspros the drums included in ez drummer are the most realistic computer drums i have ever heard i m using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound all sounds are midi which means you can manipulate how you see fit i use ez drummer with mixcraft and have modified pretty much every beat i have used so far with the built in midi editing capabilities the interface is clean an easy to use you just drag a beat from the ez drummer window into your daw cons when i was reading reviews i just thought the people complaining about the install activation were being wusses i mean seriously how hard can it be well they were right it sucks it took me two hours to get it all working my advice don t even install the app from the included disc instead just go create yourself an account at toontrack com and download the most up to date version and all the patches for the modules that come with it my experience try to install from disc fails with a google d the problem found out i needed to get a toontrack com account and download the installer from there downloaded the mb zipped installer then i had to unzip the files which took about minutes on my pc i was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install then i had to jump through one final hoop to active it take this key copy it here then copy this here stand on your head etc great software horrible install slick the low e tuner on my lp standard broke about a week ago the back came off and the tuning handle popped out i never liked the ones that were on it but i didn t want to drop the unless i needed to i came across these grovers they had good reviews and the price was right took me about minutes to replace all the tuners and re string the guitar the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced it s hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as i haven t had them on for long enough they seem better though as the b string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly i decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these grovers they fit better i e tighter nothing wrong with the new screws i just like my stuff to be snug i like them and glad i purchased them so far
192	the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire pin then ties to pin with the ground wire this mixer has four mic inputs it has some fun effects this mixer comes with a hz filter and a band equalizer on the mic channels it has a fx send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono i do not hear any external noise it has a durable metalic case this mixer has great audio great price and helped out with recording to a tascam track cassette which i like using on occasion vs digital and just plain useful with so many other apps excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage these cables are very good quality i like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage they are good quality and very durable i m using four of these for podcasting they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used i am completely happy this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones this passive di box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input some notes on this box are that the db attenuation still has some attenuation the db attenuation sounded funny but that is probably because i used the same equipment for all attenuation settings with each attenuation setting i had to adjust the input volume accordingly this device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops all the devices that i tried this with did not have their own internal grounding so i needed to have the ground come from the mixer i did get some hum when i would touch the case just like i did with other di boxes this product worked very well for my needs this microphone stand it a fairly good buy because it is a light and portable stand it is not built to be fully extended with microphones such as the behringer xm s adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone i found that i needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended as it stands i would suggest this as a fairly good deal
193	thankfully i still have most of these picks i m always losing them but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on i have been using this brand in several different gauges for many years and continueto do so i get long life and very good clarity from d addarios i just had a guitar setup with dr pure blues s and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff i ve also noticed a bit of what i must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so it almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as black as the oxidation i ve seen from low quality strings they also seem to have more string squeak when changing chords than other brands even after generously spritzing them withfingerease guitar string lubricanti am not qualified to say if they truly give you that vintage tone but they do sound decent however for i would rather getdean markley blue steel lt electric guitar strings or save some money and go withd addario exl electric guitar strings super light evenernie ball super slinky string set seem to feel better to me but i am a da dairy o man for now i m a guitarist with a passion for blues so it was only a matter of time before i was going to pick up the harmonica i almost went with some of the cheaper options but i am extremely pleased with my decision it sounds gorgeous very full and clear and i ve already been able to start bending some notes which i understand i notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas as a blues guitarist i was tempted to buy a harmonica in d or a that when played in second position would allow me to play along with blues songs in a or e two of the most common blues keys especially among the songs i like to play the second position for the harp in c is g not terribly common however i think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in c since many of the beginner songs are in c and the c major scale should be very familiar to most musicians in other words as i m exploring the notes they make a lot of sense to me at this price i won t mind buying a d or a when the time comes it s not like i m already at a level where i m dying to play those songs anyway and if i need to there are a couple of songs i ve found in g e g work song by butterfield that song along should keep my practicing for a long time if you are still reading this review then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp add it to your cart this strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff the only issue i have with it is that the ends are not the same size so i could not install my dunlop straploks for it it may just have been the one i got though this is a must have really it is pack very well and i use it everyday please get one of these if you are tried of paying someone to do your guitar setup the only solid white leather strap i could find that didn t have any ornamentation it is of average quality but for the price i wasn t expecting much it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg xx
194	this is my second black suede leather strap i ve bought from levy s i love them the is wide and comfy the strap is soft i have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart they re high quality and they offer plenty of length adjustments without any buckles or metal of any kind gorgeous strapped to my son s martin acoustic guitar he loves it it s pretty without distracting from the guitar itself very well made and durable i ve even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water the leather is a bit stiff but it broke in in no time this will last a very long time this is a well made guitar strap and is exactly as described suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather and inches is fairly narrow if this is what you want then this guitar strap is perfect if you prefer the strap slip easily or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more then it won t be definitely top notch if this is what you are after though stars i now have two of these really wish now i had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase kicks self and all i can say you simply can t beat it i also have a hercules tri stand x more expensive than this one and between the two gotta admit the only major advantage my tri stand has is saving space which actually is a huge consideration for me i honestly don t know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two musician s gear tubular guitar stands i currently own never once have given me an issue aside from bodily running into the thing and they have held do hold a variety guitars of various styles banjos both open back and bg resonator mandolas anything with a long neck all in all unless there is some specialized stand need i would first come to musician s gear over the years i ve literally owned dozens of electronic tuners generally five or six at a time in various locations ranging from a musiciansfriend promotional item to a rack mount most have been in the range from sabine yamaha korg and seiko the seiko sat e is my all time favorite because like mama bear in the fairy tale it affordably splits the difference between too small and too big it stays put on the floor when i run it inline between my guitar bass uke and my amp and its lcd display is large enough to be legible when i m standing at the same time it neatly fits in my ukulele case beyond that it simply does what good electronic tuners do accurately and without fanfare bravo
195	i purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together it does and it does it well very solid build never felt cheap in any way perfect for its intended use i purchased a second one after using the first for one month would buy again should the need arise i ve been recording professionally for years music radio commercials and television mostly so i ll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase i ve owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i can t remember them all but i can i say i ve never had a bad a t s s and s i use every week and have for years the going back to the mid s and the is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a t family you have no idea the of recordings that you re hearing this brand on it s used by almost every studio on every continent i work in the us italy to scotland and can attest to this but first let me tell you very simply where the negative reviewers went wrong this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic which is pro and best so it requires a phantom powered xlr input which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces which you should really purchase along with this if you haven t already because for around you ll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring you ll find one by searching audio interfaces i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don t need avid hd s to get started audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option don t try an adapter on it it won t work as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want it doesn t come with the cord what a surprise quality cords will cost about half the price of this but a version will probably do for most it doesn t come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like work with it you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do you ll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual but i can also recommend using large foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen this isn t about being cheap there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don t work at strange angles and you ll probably always need one or the other this does not come with a stand so pick up a boom stand if you don t have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over wheelers also tip over recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they ve put a faux plastic one if it s possible you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male for desktop users here s what i d do using large command strips and velcro i d fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini boomhere s another optionmxl mics mxl bcd standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting if you need something figure it out your clean quiet recording is proof that it works i can t justify comparing this to my to mics like it but if there is a better value buy it wouldn t have bought a case for most of my condensers it sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics the is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a without issue also individual mics have a sound of the eight s i have i prefer of them and use them the most so when reviewers say it s bright i say compared to what i can tell you what it sounds like ka ching a great sound in audio recording uh huh i know of one professional recording it s on and the client was clueless that i used an mic think about it would this be as good as what was used years ago have you heard good s recordings anyone purchasing equipment because it sounds better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it lot s of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don t ignore them but ask yourself this do they have formal training and experience with different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost and won t be half of what you ll achieve by improving your recording technique this type of mic is excellent for overhead acoustics amps or brass and of course vocals really most recording needs having a less uni and more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it s better suited to recording just understand you can t get too loud near it or you ll overdrive it since it s designed for up to screaming vocals so back off with loud amps and brass which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it ll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor s tv that is a good thing what s bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment so don t blame a mic for your extraneous room noise you can t just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind just quiet anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical rather than electronic signal to noise ratio a db pad will reduce output but doesn t affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won t help that s not even its purpose i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam music tutsplus dot com tutorials beginners guide to acoustic treatment audio just replace the dot turn off your heat air be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between and am when the world s a quieter place and that will really help you ll likely hear how loud your computer fans are you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions but you need quiet i ve known acoustic players who ve worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing if this is what your budget allows for it s an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost i keep saying this type of mic and the reason why is because a t sells models like this style up to this model is the lowest priced but you re buying a reputable brand if your future plans include using only one mic without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware you can look here audio technica at usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at usb cardioid condenser microphone w pop filterthis is not my advice you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface this model is not usb now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds i won t tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won t apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio descriptions are worthless only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters this is important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn t the recording cannot sound better than the source so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone accurate or inaccurate not good or bad there s a difference it s during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound apply these same thoughts to your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than the recording and that s why accuracy is important in your monitors so search out any info you don t understand and don t expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling training and having worked in a professional setting if you re lucky like i was after year of tech school i worked on site repair studios often need pt and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next then after years of work tv with another year of school i became a studio owner real recording involves a facility equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital so study electronics acoustics the auditory cortex everything audio train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day it never stops when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn t mean you re educated in its use so yes i also don t recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother unless but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording quit all that sleeping eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk i have so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i m just here to help you out if you need a good small inexpensive stereo amp check this one out topping tp digital mini amplifier it works got on time i am happy this is a quality stand i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great nothing but praise for this item it is ok as long as you don t bump your guitar else boom it hits the floor i don t trust it and amazon has it way over priced it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place works as advertised good construction folds easy holds acoustic or electric does not nock over easy or at all good product
196	these aren t usually my go to strings but d addarios are a good solid sounding string they last fairly long when taken care of and don t usually break too often i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing they will continue to be my nd string of choice as they ve not failed me any time i ve purchased them definitely recommended isn t it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description the product is great value for money and worth while buying if for no other reason than save money on overpriced dc power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit they don t dumb of them as all they needed to say was you needed to buy them separately which i later did seems like nit picking well it s not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me sloppy isn t it been golding up an strat plus that has seen better days wiith the gold pick guard tuning pegs and jack plate it looks like a custom shop job this finished my hard work and i am delighted with the appearance the goods are up to scratch and fit properly good service product packing and delivery time recommend them never used this seller or site for this purpose before sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks they fit perfectly and i have used them on strat and a levinson blade not forgeting my ibenez easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service this seller is worth supporting thanks people tell you you need to buy a dollar tube amp to sound good shuuut up mic this through a pa and you re set never need another amp againuse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tones for bucks spend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need i ve read some complaints about this unit maybe those folksshould shell out an additional for something better to the rest of you with the storage units this is a great tool my band i to be exact uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track i just loaded the whole pre recorded track into a slot or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background i loadedthe effect into a slot or another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need butdon t have someone else to play it you can play it back using this device
197	i purchased this key on a whim when it arrived the instructions were not clear but i sat the dial to loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning too loose and deep so i increased the setting to and repeated almost the sound i wanted so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern perfect i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest using the setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms octave apart next i worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side i used on the batter side and on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound i wanted the bass drum came next i set the batter side tension notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained this is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned set i ll never go back to tuning by ear you ll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and don t forget to write down your optimum settings all my guitars use this quick release clip its so easy to install and sturdy material it wont break easily even after many uses have one now this gauge is perfect for my gibson j the phospher bronze alloy wrap brings out hidden tonal snap in this old rather heavily braced guitar the may be too bright for a lighter instrument but they really shine on my old guitar it does everything it s supposed to do i got these for about here on amazon the dunlop or schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that i can see they lock securely don t require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar s hardware i have both dunlop and hennessy straplocks and i don t see any reason to pay more for the dunlops really they are i really don t have anything more to say about it i ve played for years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever affordable accurate and they don t fall off your knee all the time lol
198	but for a small woman with small hands it s difficult to operate it also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings which can t be good for them i ordered a schubb brand capo that s much easier to operate and doesn t smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable the only drawback to the schubb is you can t clip it to the headstock a convenience that s important to a lot of professional musicians i m keeping both if i need the convenience of this clip on style i ll use it when playing at home i ll use the more gentle schubb now i can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales a must have for guitar teachers imho what can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do i used to put my water on the stage an the time kick it over now it s right where i can find it everytime i m not one to use picks much so when i do i prefer a light pick i will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because will last a very long time it is fun to share for those needing a light pick go for these recommended i thought i was getting something that would boost amplify the signal from my bass to the amp it didn t but at it s cheap price it wasn t bad and i found other uses for it they make ones that will boost the signal so if that s what you re looking for be a careful consumer it does a good job for the price i have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat and this really helps i tried this after i lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner not sure if i lost it at a gig or my three year old son got his hands on it i d bet the latter this micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini which is nice that s about the only pro there are a few other features i guess like being able to select the instrument used but i don t need that cons the readout is smaller duh but does not seem to be as bright i play a lot of outdoor weddings in bright sun and this one is much harder to read than the mini this micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini as you move closer to in tune the bars do not smoothly move towards the center so it s easy to over or under tune and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done and those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you re trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect i m also trying to tune my semi acoustic guitar as quietly as possible so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option does it get the job done yes but there is a product that s almost the same size that works a little better for a negligible price difference it might even be cheaper if you re a beginner and want to select the instrument you re tuning and a few extra seconds isn t an issue or you play in dark environments and don t need a super bright readout this will be fine but i will be going with the mini when i buy a new one
199	i needed a volume pedal of a smaller stature for my pedal case and this one fits the bill and it s heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off i actually wasn t aware of this gauge of string until i purchased a guitar from the great george lynch the strings felt different than the s i use on my fenders and the s i use on my gibsons so the next time i saw george i asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me d addario s i love them on my mr scary guitars burnt tiger and that is the only brand gauge of string that i will ever put on that guitar i definitely recommend trying out a set these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now i ve used these for years acoustic and electric very hard to beat i like the feel and texture of these pics they do the job brilliantly this delay is really nice especially for the price i am a fan of the fab line of effects and have several of them my favorite is this delay and the echo they have been very durable and i am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable my only complaint is the markings on the level knobs they have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see this could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface this can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush but it should have been considered ahead of time although it does exactly what it says it will hold your items together pedals to pedalboard it is significantly thicker than i expected which makes it difficult to use properly without covering the entire board i purchased one strip and i will use it on my backup board but i don t plan to purchase any more
200	good length but very slippery i had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn t slide around i took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that i have been commented on a few times now for the price why not be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric as far as the base product it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time these hangers are easy to install just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business the stringed instrument becomes easily accessible and safe works as described on the ipad for the price id expect a more durable product its all plastic but no moving parts to concern yourself with so it should hold up fairly well great tuners ive had the snark s i think the blue ones and they were really good the rubber part always fell off it is too early to tell if this will last longer but so far so good
201	wawa pedals come and go and get modded and re thunk but i always wanted an original cry baby so this was a birthday gift to myself not disappointed down the road i may add some of the gazillions of electronic mods available now to personalize the sound but for the time being i m gonna enjoy this pedal as shipped very good buy great packaging earlier than expected delivery thanks amazon i bought it to use with my boss me i use the to go up and down through my banks i have programmed on the me build like a tank simply to use simply to hook up i hear it can be used on other boss and roland gear this is a very nice way to get rid of all those wall warts and batteries for your pedals easily powers my pedals and adds no noise to the signal path simple effective works as advertised the extra adapters are a nice touch get one you ll be happy you did you have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal the only think i can think of is moderately high power consumption so i suggest using the power supply rather than batteries it is a joy to play almost any style with these though i prefer jazz blues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortion oh yes the clincher is this only costs a tad over bucks very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range wow for the size this is amazing plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper nothing else to say it s great if you re in the market for one get it
202	been using these for years i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer or it could just be in my head either way i am happy with them this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling the heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through but your know that they are not going to slip back out the picture does not do it justice i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal i am very impressed with how nice this strap is the d addario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price these are excellent strings the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar they are inexpensive and sound great for somebody that is a casual home musician coated strings might be a better choice the difference somebody that plays a two or three hours every day will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money it seems like yes they are the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better there isn t a huge difference the direct comparison string is d addario exl d addario exl nickel wound electric guitar strings regular light at roughly a set these are good solid strings at a bargain price the exl bt strings are about a set if i were going through a set of strings every few days the exl s would probably be a better idea but if a set is going to last a week or two the savings overall is pretty small i would use the exl bt s my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot the new d addario coated strings are fine but they end up being about the same price as elixir i ll stick with what i know well my lucille did love these strings they worked out just fine on the packaging i don t like what d addario has done all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes they loop two strings together and i hate that when i m stringing my guitar i like to work with one string at a time and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing but seriously that little paper wouldn t kill anybody i also don t care for the color coded rings on the strings lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors it is a small thing but i don t like it i prefer that the rings all be brass one color yeah i m the only one that sees that problem if i work one string at a time from an individual envelope the color coding is not necessary these are fine strings they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend
203	it works perfect with cakewalk music creator and a digitech vocalist best price out there well i don t really know what else to say i ordered them for the guitar though i won t be using them for the banjo i prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo the thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put they feel kind of alien right now as it s the first time i ve ever wore finger picks but i ll get used to them eventually p i bought this not knowing what to expect it sounds just like i hear on tv and it sounds great i am trying to learn to play violin but was having difficulty finding the proper fingering for the notes this has been very helpful for me to check finger position i will be removing it when i can consistently find the proper placing for my fingers this has also help me in tuning the violin
204	i ve seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but i ve never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this kyser one it is by far the best i ve ever seen and i ve been using it for years now and it still works fine it makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn t corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years very highly recommended this pick holder works for me it holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed it fits my jasmine well buy it from go dps since they have one of the best customer service and quality products i automatically put these on any guitar i own as soon as i buy it i change strings and toss those white plastic pins makes any guitar look so much classier i swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too phenominal value tons of bang for the buck they look soooo good on there installed easily in different guitars so far so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar i didn t want to spend a lot if it just wouldn t sound good with a pickup and saw this had consistently good ratings i can t speak for other acoustic pickups but this far exceeded my expectations and i don t plan on buying a more expensive piezo or soundhole pickup attaching itunfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the end tail block and i didn t want to drill a new hole in my not so cheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickup so i attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge and just ran the cable out from the sound hole the jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape which is kind of like really strong gum it can be removed without leaving sticky residue which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as i don t jerk the guitar quickly sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa the package mentions two locations you can place the pickup and because i needed to run it through the sound hole i could only place it where more treble is picked up so i have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to or lowerbecause the pickup is a transducer no electrical feedback interference is picked up so the sound will be very clear and crisp it would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding the only noise i get even at max gain max input volume is from the amp itself heard with every instrument i plug into it if i turn the master volume up too high another thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations so it won t pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body but will when touching it so with that in mind the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body like it brushing up against your body a zipper hitting the guitar your fingers sliding on the strings etc i have nothing but good things to say about the snark sn accurate easy to use clear display and much smaller than i anticipated yet it s quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar at home or on the go i can t see the need for another tuner
205	does what it is supposed to do it is pretty good quality and durable too quick simple and efficient i would definitely buy again highly recommended this is a very good pickholder by dunlop and looks much nicer than the regular dunlop or it does what it should and looks more esthetical than the dunlop or versions it does not hold more picks than its predecessors and it actually holds a couple of picks less it holds some or maybe picks while the holds around if you use gauge picks or lower i did the test just for the heck of it with several picks since i use the planet waves chrome dome stainless steel picks joe satriani i only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one i am playing with so for me it does the job perfectly i have a nice paul reed smith custom with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top so i needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it the adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitar s top if placed as instructed place it gently no need to press it too hard alean the surface very well before placing but do not use carnauba or any polishing material or gel before installing just regular guitar top cleaner i use the prs cleaner for example cheers elixir s nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings are the best strings i ve ever used on my alvarez acoustic a guitar i ve now owned for over years they certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there they have a nice punchy tone and are easy on the fingers unlike the elixir extra lights that i found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short scale guitar these seem like an ideal combination i may buy another set soon and restring the short scale instrument with lights compared with some brands and gauges of more old school strings there may be a little less bass response but these sound good pretty even through the set and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low e string strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded it was time to replace all with frest strings these are great did the job
206	mics are like pants you have to find the right fit this one i like for my vocals live i sing fairly low and airy works great for me also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live very sweet sound i prefer it to the seems a bit more bright and natural might purchase another one eventually i play nights a week in a midi assisted duo our pa is a pair of mackie thumps powered on the floor and behringer b d powered on stands with a mackie board we adjust the pa to the room by adding or reducing the number of powered speakers in larger rooms we have a regular pair of floor monitors but in smaller rooms where you are stuck in a corner between the coat rack and the waiters station you know the spot where they generously removed two small tables we don t have space for floor monitors these smaller jobs have become much more common and i needed a compact yet powerful monitor since we work with midi sound modules to reproduce the drums bass and assorted extra instuments it is very important that we hear these sounds clearly the behringer monitors do the job well the overall sound is clean and clear the speakers are light and portable and for me the boom stand adapter works well i compared the behringers to their clone the mackie srm and frankly i couldn t hear a major difference with my mp player playing through them obviously behringer cloned the mackie s and did a good job they have all of the same inputs and outputs as the mackie s and look almost exactly the same i have owned a pair of behringer b d powered speakers for about three years now and they have been knocked over and mistreated accidentally and still work great every night so i am a fan of behringer gear in the end the real difference was the price the behringer s go for while the mackie s go for about the choice was simple since i couldn t hear or see a major difference i bought the behringer s i have only had them for about two months but i have been pleased so far update it has been a couple of months more since i started using these monitors and have even purchased an additional one i still love the sound and all of the other things i posted above but forget about the boom stand adapter it is very difficult to get lined up so the mic is facing you and because of the angle of the monitor itself which is not adjustable the boom will not stay in place i am using a good quality telescoping mini boom that is not very big or heavy at all but it will not stay up save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand other than that these are great monitors i ve been using gls cable for years now and i never had a problem with it they re good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it
207	i should have read the reviews carefully it s definitely something different but not sturdy at all rubber bits come off as you strum and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers ouch i m much happier with my friday the th glow in the dark picks that is an experiment that worked and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming why don t you use your fingers this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to i like the size smaller than your regular picks and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness they are also a bit pointier than regular picks and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much i use light or medium regular size picks for strumming i really like the fit feel of this plucking pick smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings you might balk at the price but i do not regret it in the least some nice picking with this pick i don t play a lot so i figured ought to last me quite a while i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too but the dunlop is better to me
208	the product feels a little on the cheap side but definitely does the job the way it should so that s all i care about it was cheap and came fast i recommend it what a difference a pop filter makes i use on a condenser mic it lets me get a little more gain input clamps on easy and holds good the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job i like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension it has improved the vocal tracks just one more affordable improvement for the home studio my first desk mic stand and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use it worked once when i originally set it then kaput it s never worked properly since i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it s at the right height i would not purchase this product again i tested in my friend recording studio and work really good trust me for the price it over the top some items of gls work great others are awful don t trust the products anymore it s unfortunate but i don t feel safe with their products that they ll perform when i need them to
209	looks vintage but works great at a great price as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money awe it might have deserved stars had it had a chance to prove itself but i did buy another that i still have but it is still in it s original packaging as a back up for my other cords until i break it out and use it hard for months i have nothing else to say here
210	i bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio most of the band members don t mind them its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes recommended one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ i like the old version more these are a little tricky to mount but do track well and are not obnoxious looking like the snark tuners perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone s pedal board many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting the ditto is great for practice though
211	very good stand especially for the price it is not incredibly stable but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound no too much heat and easy plug for instant job i have used the line looper in the past line jm looper the line is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier it s a decent looper but it s too big and i don t need all the guitar tones backing tracks etc that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere i wanted a looper that i could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality multiple channels etc and this one fit the bill you can adjust the loop volume switch quickly between tracks turn the background percussion down or off etc i purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracks the only fault that i ve found thus far is that the foot switch cable that digitech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a degree this is weird as all pedals on a board need a degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal to solve this i bought a hosa degree stereo connector it has to be stereo hosa rt angl ster phone f stereo phone m i ve added a photo of the jamman on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thepedaltrain mini with soft casephotos one other great attribute of this pedal is it s built solid and is easy to stomp on you don t have to have perfect aim just good timing there are a few strange nuances though for example you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track this gets the track started before it clears it not good if you were using it in a performance however there are workarounds like just switching tracks overall great deal for the price and if you are looking to improve your lead guitar improv i would certainly recommend a pedal like this one classic tubescreamer tone at the price what s not to love one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp i d definitely buy it again construction isn t great but at who cares this pedal lives up to the hype distortion wise it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type od and a full on distortion like a crunchbox or rat i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one i think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos more transparent and organic sounding i have owned the fulltone ocd in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly i also own a v dano cool cat od which is an excellent ocd ish pedal but this one is getting more action these days i am running this into the front of either a palomino v or a jet city watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup the pedal also plays well with others i am getting nice lead tones by running a ts type of od into the front of this one the jf is a really nice dirtbox and not just for the price the fact that you can own it for clams or less makes it a no brainer for those of you who like myself are addicted to dirtboxes i have noticed some price gouging with a few vendors on here shop around i knew the build quality was decent because i own the joyo vintage overdrive and they are both built like bricks i always wanted a boomerang iii looper which at almost was not really a justifiable expense for me then i found this for about and i immediately sprung for it this is a great practice tool all it does is make loops the learning curve is very low and there s no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total minute recording time there are no quirky timing issues to be found here your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops this does take some getting used to but it makes you a much better musician in the process your drummer and bassist will thank you this could possibly even be used as a live performance tool although you d have to be very very proficient with this tool and be playing very very tightly in the pocket i personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this lest something go wrong on stage and lest i subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick students would be especially encouraged to get one of these my playing has definitely grown and improved since i finally broke down and bought a looper
212	how much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand first it a great price about the same as a big mac lol second it fits great does exactly what it s supposed to do third now that i use a pick holder i wonder why i never did so before i do have a tendency to break drop or even wear out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency i have some solid heavier weighted stands that stand up to a quick grab of a pick from this holder but when using one of my cheaper lighter tripod style stands i make sure i m careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so i don t pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick great product couldn t live without it lol and it s not the manufacturer s fault i have some cheap light weight stands if you re looking for a pick holder i can t think of any reason not to try this one a great deal here on amazon these cost a lot more a few years ago it appears chief bought raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing the shelf i received has slots all over it instead of a bunch of screw holes this makes it really easy to mount things i m ordering more of these they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets good luck and good music to all great cord for the money works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas will buy more in future love this amp my drummer is stoked to be able to use this product and has really enhance our music affordable and great quality this is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming i love the added level of control the grip surface gives me good cable and has m et all of our needs as all of know who use cables only time will tell whether they will last
213	volume control is nice two clicks to choose from the low click is better than the high one to my ear i would recommend this product i bought two of these one for each of my sons and i wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age so far they seem awesome they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them definitely not a flimsy stand if you are totally a beginner and have nothing to begin with get this guitar and a vox amplug ac use it with your headphones or home speakers don t upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level prepare for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade if your budget is below that don t bother and save more speak from experience i ve tried a lot and did many research this guitar with amplug just sound amazing plus it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out guitars and amps below yes there are good stuff but you re more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter for a budget around if you don t go professional you will be happy with them forever so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money this guitar is good enough for any beginners most under guitars don t have good pickups so why spend extra money again my bloody experience taught me that i ve spent time and money way more than free advice i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price this is more of a toy than a good pickup it functions but doesn t sound great what did i want for this price anyway an amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar months and no problems yet
214	i was hoping the lemon oil would be what i needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but it s not very good at that i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry once clean the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood even where years of playing have taken their toll it s a good finish but not the place to start the product is not meant to be used on maple don t know why but not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark exotic woods so far so good good cheap basic metal slide sounds like it should only problem is i prefer to wear it on my ring finger but i have big hands viz xl and xxl gloves and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger a bit annoying but not the slide s fault i guess i like to walk around while i play it s a hangup of mine this strap works fine for that the only thing i ve noticed that can be annoying is that strap moves easily across my back so it is very easy to get the guitar out of position the neck too high or too low other than that it s a good deal for the price maybe i just need a shirt with more cling very smart handy design that my acoustic guitar doesn t have to be drilled a hole for it s very easy to buckle the guitar strap on the neck its botton button of the guitar that is the display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle maybe i m using it wrong but ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs but from there it works great just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a good angle after years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths i love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time may be due to vibration when packing setting up or maybe it s just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface no matter i won t be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again one advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size especially when connecting stereo devices much narrower than the degree metal shells with screws a couple of concerns i had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length as it turns out they don t contribute to higher noise levels and they are just the right length for all my pedal connections everything is connected using this single length patch love the color coding too especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and b channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light and what to do if one does fail toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature i ll always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board it s a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff love these patch cables
215	use this for my desk mic at home it hold my mic right where i want it and doesn t move from where i place it worth every penny and then some this is a nice microphone stand i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems i would purchase this again it s sturdy and gets the job done we bought this tester for our son to use for his band s equipment set up it appears to be well constructed and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues i am impressed how well this works i was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs this has solved it it s important to you to know the diameter of your guitar s soundhole i ve tried this with different acoustic electric guitars fender cd and fender kingman both of them with cm in diameter and fits perfectly i had read all reviews before deciding purchase and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering i should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound unplugged i would not consider this as a solution for it if you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar without hesitation this one is for you the fact that it is passive really kills it i just could not get any sound out of it i tried multiple placements i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it not worth the money or the extra hole in your guitar i highly recommend these tuners they are the best i have found for fiddle and mandolin they also work well with acoustical guitar
216	what great idea to put all three tools needed when changing strings into one tool the cutter even works well the picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package all picks were there saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car they feel good in my hand while strumming the strings good deal and i will purchase again these are the best guitar strings i have used in over years of playing the guitar made in usa a very good price you can buy more expensive guitar strings just not better guitar strings look at the price because this thing really sounds good it s no toy it s a real retro electric guitar effects pedal i m very happy with this purchase nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound no too much heat and easy plug for instant job i wonder if all these snarks no matter whether they are to have all the same frequency ranges i have them all and they all work great i think i got a great buy love the color and it has a strong spring holds very well great price
217	the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily just try and leave it on always its cheap but it wont fail wont drop your guitar if you re careful these are the best strings around last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern my guitars largely stay at home so they don t require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case hard cases almost always cost dollars or more and also take up about twice as much room which is problematic for storing multiple instruments in most cases a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs and costs about of the price of a hard case i bought two different variations of the fender gig bag and i believe the one pictured here is the one that has fender medium guitar picks as zipper handles which is a cool touch the case fits my fender squier strat guitars or other guitars of a similar size snugly there is not a ton of padding but more than you might think from the pictures especially on top the pocket is fine and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps i can t say that the zippers will withstand years of use but for most uses they should do just fine glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars this guitar just got stolen from me frikkin thieves i loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands it is super light unlike my other gretsch guitar so easy to take anywhere it can handle some rough playing its simply awesome specially for what it costs i am sooooo getting another one d this violin is amazing considering it s price i got it for my girlfriend expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn t she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked i am a satisfied costumer for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it this one s for you basic but sturdy gets the job done i wanted this for overall practice however the only clear and good sound will be the satriani effect if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted it can t still use it for practice and wont change it its just hard to get a clean sound out of it
218	i was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasn t recognized and i sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel now it s working no complaints it s quiet enough and the price is right is it a monster cable no but it doesn t cost as much either i ve used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine tone control didn t work so it was returned but it was pretty nice even though i felt the fret board quality is higher on my gibson les paul but what can you expect if i had to order it again i would pay more and get the sg which has the quality pickups the sound is let s say average good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups the bolt in neck didn t bother me but the sg doesn t have that which is another reason i would step up next time shape is ok purely subjective i like the solid les paul shape now a little better since it s more conservative but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style can t believe they can make a good guitar like this for only bucks also even though i was tempted with the faded finish the glossy finish is really nice this guitar will make a player proud i sent it back probably due to my ignorance has multiple patterns to collect sound was a clear mike but i didn t detect any body to the sound maybe a preamp would have helped i checked out many mikes and ended up with a rode nt a which is probably similar in character my goal was to record my voice without color and this came close i wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars suspicious ratings to me now that i have more experience i would be curious to check it out but since i found a good solution i don t think it s worth the effort i ve paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didn t sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does and mind you i have yet to even change the facory strings out so if you re looking for a quality guitar at a price that s more than fair there simply isn t a better deal around i bought one then i bought two more then i bought two more these things are well made in the good ol us of a look good and are a deal none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall which is good right but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio there s a slight hiss too but i enjoyed listening to it while playing and when you attach the headphones it works great amazine that it works off a v battery yes you have to lug around a guitar cord but what do you expect i went all out and got a roland cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects but that costs x or more as much i am in the process of returning it look at the picture of it next to a coke can that s what it looks like some people complained that the handle doesn t work who cares the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too but that s sort of what you re getting i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a practice cable i can honestly tell a difference that difference being silence no abnormal hissing or popping that i got from my other cheaper cables this isn t the top of the line monster but still a step up from what i d been using i ll definitely upgrade my longer cables to monster and may even see how the expensive one sounds a short one st of course well made works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic it is a basic music stand but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements you can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store great value best sounding vocal mike for the bucks i tried many mxl mikes under and this was the only one that came close unfortunately the top end isn t as defined as a at or nt a so i ended up forking out x as much and going with the latter it s a very solidly made stand simple to assemble perfect for my home studio holding my key midi controller keyboard i m very happy with the purchase and the price was right i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence nothing fancy about this strap unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end just well made and functional i got this for my grandson s squier by fender size acoustic it doesn t have a strap button at the top end it would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut but i work with leather and i found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand this cable is very well constructed i use it in my dj business and i highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it don t like that it s difficult to change the tube sound quality was not what i expected maybe because i wasn t familiar with the settings no power cord was included in mine or manual manual should have been include not sure about the cord dials are very small my mic and mic are much better than this i can t say it s bad just that there are better choices in my opinion this is not a top tier condenser mic but it is well worth the dollar price tag it has different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch the carrying case is also nice do not expect this to be mxl or even behringer b quality but it s still better than no condenser and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic ing works well it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically i find myself using it a lot even as i learn the notes on the guitar fret board if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note i also use it to intonate my guitar it has some other advanced features but i haven t need them display is nice and large even though i still need my reading glasses to see the note this liitle box works great for my needs i am using three guitars on stage when possible room permitting and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp this way i can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such it also solves a second problem since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs fender single coils ibanez acoustic with fishman piezo and les paul gibson humbuckers i now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match this is perfect for that inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that i velcro to my small pedal board i m glad someone else mentioned the a c plug on theirs being european standard and not volt us standard don t be surprised if it happens to you i bought one and had the same experience i got mine from musicians friend they offered to have me return it but i chose to keep it since i had a volt power supply available from an older unit i long since stopped using no stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn t check their inventory to make sure it was us standard fits mxl cube mics perfectly sturdy and easyt to setup ordered two more rare to get items these days that exceed expectation it s not as nice as my audio technica one but this does the job and i m happy a little flimsier than the at but at the price it s good but is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with use a plugin instead i like some of behringer products even though they are snobbed this particular unit is not one of their finest products but i give them credit for the price point and effort someone will appreciate it but not me it sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as it s not defective but just not up to what i want cheap so no big loss like my title says this gets the job done and is well built don t waste your money spending on premium brands like monster cable and get this instead i challenge anyone to a blind test who can say they can tell a difference brass tacks is this the greatest mic in the world no but on a budget this mic is amazing the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out if you are looking for s nice rich sound this is it if you want to upgrade from a headset cheap mic blue yeti or at buy this mic and an audio interface you won t regret it the issue isn t whether it sounds exactly like a tube screamer the issue for me at least is does it sound good is it musical does it sound like an overdriven amp i say it does it sounds great for blues and rock i ve only had it for a couple weeks and i hope that it continues to work well for a long time i ve heard that these can be fragile but i m pretty gentle with my gear if it breaks i ll post about it i put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far no dead cables yet i ve been using them for months or so excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice good price leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap i would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button the button is not a snap i just lack the word to describe it previously i used to use a shoe lace and i would be thinking about it falling while playing now i have more confidence with this strap it s not gucci but doesn t feel like plastic either
219	i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly then snap it in then turn and turn the screw oops don t let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again what a farce this is the worst capo i ve owned and i ve tried nearly every brand and type yeah i ve had people show me how to do it right and i know to do it right it s just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on snapping it screwing it in screwing it off having it fall off forget it it s garbage to me also while i m getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw it s actually slightly painful to the fingers momentarily but why have to deal with that to work with this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable no thanks most of the time i am able to use the g capo with one hand when moving it adjusting it and clamping it in place however sometimes i have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don t buzz that may seem like not such a big deal but i prefer to have an easier one to work with i have small hands and an old carpal injury so i prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo this one is better than the any of the clasping kinds keysers etc in that respect after a couple of playing sessions i figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time now that i ve learned how best to use it i ll keep it when i first got it i was upset that i had to use hands and forcible squeezing to put in place but now i ve learned how to work it better so that i can do most of it with one hand without too much strain a capo should be easy to remove and put on stay in tune not hurt the hands no handed squeezing not interfere with playing when inserted and it shouldn t break too soon have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all on the plus side this unit seems pretty well made so it should last a long time i think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically i ve tried so many capos now and the only ones i liked were the planet waves screw tops they are easy to use easy to move from fret to fret light on the hands stay in tune and out of the way but they break in damp california weather i ve had of them break on me within a couple months they snap and go airborn which is dangerous next i ll try the dunlop victor capos they are screw tops similar in style to the planet waves dunlop also makes the planet waves capos but they are made with more durable bronze so they should last longer and i hope those will be the best for me i also ordered an aluminum version of the planet waves in hopes it won t break like their thermoplastic ones do if you have small hands like me and don t want to strain the hands while playing like me then that rules out the kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos the shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust and the springtop ones are suspect as well that s why i like the screwtops that don t get in the way and are easy to adjust ok i hope the dunlop victor will do the job for me now i ll try it next i purchased a classical guitar and only had a traditional steel string capo available to me not thinking it through i used it on my nylon stings and after a few times i realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced along with my string order i added this capo so it does not happen again pros it s small and lightweight it s very well made it not only looks great but also appear to be of high quality it s very adjustable unlike my steel string capo this uses a screw knob to tighten not spring loaded this allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings it works on steel strings yep i found my self needing a capo on another guitar and only having this with me i saw no reason it should not work so i gave it a try and it performed wonderfully i won t be using it full time on my steel strings but great to know in a pinch i have use it if you need a great capo thats gentle on your nylon strings then this is the one to get i love this capo let me tell you about my capo journey where i ve used every brand while searching for this one first i always owned the old dunlop toggle action capo which is just old tech you know where it s just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber the kind one used to use before i had to go back to that when my first planet waves black thermoplastic capo broke don t buy those if you live in a damp climate like ca each one i bought broke one broke within a week during the winter rainy days so i loved those capos they were perfect but i was done with the breaking so i figured i d try others instead despite my love for the planet waves design i didn t know about the silver aluminum one yet well i hated each other one i tried kyser if you have had carpal and or are small handed you know what i mean you don t want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don t want to play the guitar i really hate the kysers i know some folks love to squeeze and use them that s fine different strokes right then i tried the schub you have to be kidding me omg that thing is so ridiculous it pops off it wiggles about it is tricky i hate it now i know many folks are schub fans who give me a drive by downrate i m not saying it isn t great for those who love it if you love the schub you love it unconditionally and i respect that all i m saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me there are other models that fail similarly to these they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands like the g i did fall in love with it until maybe the th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on awk ward and painful sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby but if you have carpal you know what i mean you want to go easy on the hands and arms and not brutalize them the other thing i ve always hated about the kysers and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder that s just dumb kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don t mind it or claim it doesn t do that but you know what i m talking about ok so then because of all the broken planet waves thermoplastic capos i turned next to dunlop s turnscrew models i liked them they are very similar to the pw design but the screw location is more awkward to use and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it so i turned back in search for a better planet waves model this is it right here the silver one is excellent and it s made of aluminum not thermoplastic i bought one and it has lasted me almost years now without a single problem by now in contrast i would have run through or thermoplastic ones i want to say that if you are performing in a public venue never use the thermoplastic ones because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room and could easily poke someone s eyes out not kidding don t use those in public situations back to the excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo i love it because it doesn t break not at all and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc the great features are ease of use and easy fitting are perfect the best of all capos this capo fits so easily simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches unlike the other screwtops or all other capos there s no need for any moving around adjusting the guitar falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar sheesh none of that nonsense you put it on and they ve engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on move it from fret to fret put it where you want and screw it in with great ease wow best ever in this category ease of use is tops ever it will never hurt you it only helps it weighs nothing is easy to carry you can slip it onto the peg area it just is so light i still can t believe how light it feels it does what it s supposed to that other capos don t do no issues with being in tune just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire no wrestling around like some capos do the screw is in the most easy location and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn t hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew it s a breeze no problems with the size it s so small it doesn t get in your way on the fretboard you won t have to do hand yoga in order to play capo d songs it is flat i know what a concept a capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords not pretzeled twister instead of chords now i play capo d songs all the time because of this capo and it is so much fun musically a whole new magical experience the truth i ve found is that good equipment matters in music making i never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until i got my first applause guitar with great action i have a yamaha i love now since the applause necks break but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that s easy to use in the case of guitars great action is imperative in the case of capos ease of use and no pain produced is imperative and it opens up the world of capo use the magic of the mathematics of music theory if you love the other brands don t diss me i know it s perfect for you and i m happy for you that it works perfectly for you because when you have the best one for you you will shine with your music and i will enjoy listening to you play but those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what i m talking about you won t settle for the torture of kysers and schubs gotta be kidding me i bought every capo imaginable need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile but ended up that i was using the old toggle type again instead until i found the aluminum silver planet waves capo planet waves has made the perfect capo now no more issues just easy fun playing capo d songs again only buy the silver model because when if you get silver you are guaranteed to get aluminum not thermoplastic these stands are great for my lesson business i bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight
220	this is a fun pick i play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought i d give this a try its great i love the tone of this pick striking strings i love the way it transmits the feel of the strings more organic than plastic picks yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard i think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you ll be fine its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument worth a try i have both this tuner and a snark for each of my instruments though i am not a professional musician i find each them to be of equal accuracy in fact the d addario s compact size and fit is totally un noticeable and though its screen is micro in size it is very clear and viewable denoting flat sharp notation a great choice for the price for years i have used a kyser capo because i like the trigger action i have run into a few issues when switching between my to string guitar i haven t used it much on my electrics though i like the kyser the planet waves tri action is super slick it is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open the trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser a few twist to adjust it and i can easily capo between my or string without any problem light easy and quick i am now a believer i m switching to the planet tri action it is definitely worth the few extra bucks i ll start off by saying that i m a proud owner of gibson es acoustic electric pono msd e blackheart bh h blackheart bh a weber vintage series a inch ohm watts in an open back solid pine cabinet a jensen mod inch ohm watts all tube fender tweed champnow that you know the gear i have what i can play through an amp and what i can plug an amp head into i ll sum up my review with this what you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab the cables you use and how clean your power is got good gear this little amp will sound great the detailsthe amp itself is tiny i have an electro harmonix pedal that s bigger than this amp still it packs a punch with the gain at about up and the volume at half i get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go yes this little amp will go from jazz country to rock metal with a twist of a dial the line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can practice time just got better for your neighbors the one lone tube in the micro terror is the pre amp tube mine came stock with a jj tubes ax i understand that s standard a jj is nice but it will not warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone dig out an old phillips rca sylvania or ge to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother i had an old ge made in great britain lying around and popped it in my micro terror warmed it right up cleaned up a bunch of high end tinniness still compared to my two tube bh h or my all tube champ this guy does sound more solid state than anything but compared to a buddy s roland and solid state ampeg it s downright mellow no effects loop means that your time based effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy so if you like pedals stock up on volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in speaking of power adapters a previous reviewer is right the external power brick for this guy seems fragile i m not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp it s holding up but one round with my cat and i ll be looking for a new power supply the rubannoyance one cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying hiss even at low volumes i found that out quickly so get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp i m running it with a gls gauge speaker cable and a planet waves american stage instrument cable both available here at amazon or any good guitar shop annoyance this is a watt amp right well if you don t run a ohm speaker you won t get all watts the micro terror self adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output yes yes don t quote physics to me at ohms i still get good volume but at ohms like my bh it sounds like a or watt amp that said i m actually a fan of the tone i get with my ohm weber in its pine cab the inch jensen speaker in my champ while nice can t put out the low notes like i d prefer and the jensen mod is too clean but the weber a sounds fantastic to my ears even with the loss in volume annoyance the micro terror is so small and so light it ll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord unlike a nice pound amp the chord won t pull out so be careful mitigation for annoyance the all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors though it will gouge your floor and then there s the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier if the power is noisy or ungrounded you will wind up with hiss no matter what i always carry a monster hts and run my amp through it that really helps in cleaning up signal noise if you don t have one get one the are cheap and they work the summaryafter all that i can still say i love this little amp i ve gigged with it and it sings well plus the added gag of tiny ukulele tiny amp always draws a laugh until i crank the dial over and shred some faces for the price you can likely afford to pick up worth of guitar speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig and for the price this is a solid star amp i know i m happy these headphones are amazing i could not believe the sound quality i have been an audio engineer for over years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price no i do not work for tascam the first pair i bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily so i ordered another pair because the sound is amazing i just need to be more careful next time but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction i have yanked my senhieser s millions of times and the cord never broke so be careful with the cord on this headphone it is not the best but the sound is superior i completely agree with jpfromoh this planet waves d addario artist capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly the micro adjusting knob for tweaking tension pressure is nice but i ve wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar ukulele that i have a standard tension spring might be a bit too firm but at least it s consistent i also thought i d like the curved cradle for the neck but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele i know i know this isn t designed for ukuleles but i have no such troubles with my kyser capos i don t understand the clip for a tuner on this thing i have several clip on tuners that clip directly to the headstock and most are planet waves already why would i want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when i m using the capo i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition and the pick holder is a nice touch but i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me as others have noted there are other better capos out there so first up i ve been using macs to record music since the g cube yeah go look that up anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices and then yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy but i haven t encountered anything so plug play simple as the apogee jam k since gefen introduced the imic just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go also it s not flimsy it is made of plastic but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk it pulls power from your machine so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings this also helps those of us using electric guitars that don t have extra wound humbuckers i tested the apogee jam on a new macbook air an iphone and a ipad mini garageband instantly knew what was going on but protools did need a bit of coaching a small device that doesn t color input sound and doesn t get in the way just what i needed
221	depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes that comes in handy they make another version which is less pointy i like that one a little bit better guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic and i m sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient even so d addario has provided a consistent product for more years than i ll readily admit to knowing i ve used may other brands but i seem to always return to d addario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars possibly the best quality mic cable i have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear for the working musician or home recording man this is great extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over southern california and the nation
222	i normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy these picks keep a nice bright tone very little friction on the strings so low string noise enough grip to stay put in hands well too these strings are the bomb i have used d addario s since my earliest playing days over the years i have experimented with several different brands and eventually found myself at home with elixir polyweb lights after having the frets on my guitar a fender grand concert redressed i noticed it had been restrung with exp s which i used eight years ago and loved since they were on the guitar i decided to give them another try i am glad i did the tone is great they speak with a natural bright and lively voice that is sweet to the ears exp s make my guitar sound like it should individual notes speak with warmth definition and depth they blend together beautifully when paying chords they have more punch to them than elixir s do and the coating doesn t fray after a year like elixirs either d addario exp s are probably the most musical strings i have ever used they respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking i was able to get eight months out of them before i noticed deterioration in tone i think i have found my strings and i don t see myself using anything else for a while i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction one of the features i like is that it just doesn t take up too much room and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand i ve owned this and a couple of other korge tuners in the past and currently own three in the past i would use a keyboard to get the bottom e on my guitar and take it from there these days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive i keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when i go out with my guitars i also use it to tune my violin and it works great if you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better over all for the cost you can t go wrong these used to be expensive none essentials but today they re small accurate and portable as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand having purchased many things before through amazon com i have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted remembering that there will always be a few cranks this music stand got good reviews and i can say that i too am very happy with it i would recommend this purchase to any one
223	good strings with good sound the extra light is easier on the fingers but they sound thinner too go for the light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure these picks are nylon so each one will last you a couple of years as long as you don t lose them this is thicker than the mm so you can dig into the strings a little better but still a hair flimsier than the snarling dogs mm picks i know they re the same size but trust me these are flimsier and the grip is ok you can t go wrong here if you can t find a container and add your own sponge then buy this keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential i think this item should cost three bucks at most and would still yield a healthy profit i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better i use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughts if you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood i already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw i like that one more and overall quality seems better on it even though pricing was similar when i bought the first one and the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they don t line up just right but when i put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay and that s the important part i was hoping this product would eliminate string talking and had mixed results it helped some but didn t get rid of the noise entirely it also makes the strings feel nice as well i will continue to use it its really good i like the idea of covering all the strings width and easily applying but the point its dried fast
224	i use a late s yamaha steel string with this going into an lr baggs para di and it works amazingly well the sound is impeccable but you can t expect to just plug it in and go you ll need a feedback buster and a good preamp but it really does the job good tone i bought this because i had a gig in a dark bar i used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly for some songs i have three sheet of paper which overlapped about an inch and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots i can t imagine in what situation i would ever need to use the brighter setting i was thinking of getting the cheaper smaller version but didn t want to risk it not covering three pages the gig bag is a square and softly padded there is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so i don t expect much protection for the light or adapter treat the light like it has no bag and you ll be fine they include batteries i didn t see them until i pulled out the adapter for this review to get you started using the light but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you shouldn t have to worry about it making it to your power supply great tone and tuning stability was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat really helped with the bigsby tuning stability i like this capo because you can adjust the pressure but i ve had it pop of easily twice already have others i trust more love joyo pedals not sure yet on the new line they just dont feel as solid to me that being said the pedal sounds great great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch time will tell joyo makes great quality products cheap i love this product it works great all my pedals hove there own power supply the flashback x is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under new a steal in my opinion having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly the toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website it s simple to use my galaxy to beam the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups very cool technology makes me feel like i m on a guitar version of star trek i can t say that i have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great i am partial to the with modulation very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus the space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background which coincides with the delay time sounds great with a little overdrive added in all in all this is a great pedal and a purchase that i am totally happy with it is by far the best delay pedal i have ever owned as well as being the most versatile five stars from me perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone s pedal board many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting the ditto is great for practice though tone is subjective and stars means it just ok to me it does need a hot signal going in to sound good so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups the distortion is fuzzy but not fuzz almost like a fuzzy static the eq switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so i always have the tone in the circuit i used it with a vintage vibrolux reverb this is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal i am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me it is made well for the money i am not mad i tried it
225	nice solid cables with excellent support at the ends should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what i needed to connect my tube preamp for the money this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use good to keep as a spare in the gig box even though the title says acoustic guitar case it s obvious that this is a case for a style mandolins i chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo and the reviews were good sure enough the lining is soft and well padded the hardware works as it should and the build quality is almost perfect however when closing the case a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly just a slight push pull motion will allow the top to snap in place then everything is as it should be the case fits my a type mandolin perfectly and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around the slight mis fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case it serves its purpose well at a reasonable price this shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick i sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heart shaped fender pick the stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string good for strumming rhythm not so hot for lead i have been using d adario strings for years they sound great they stay in tune excellent sustain i can get better string control compared to other strings i have never experienced a string break in years i used to think a pick was a pick with the only difference being stiffness i should say that i prefer picks of medium stiffness the only problems i had with regular picks was them slipping in my hand turning around out of my hand on the floor and of course breaking i decided to give the dava picks a try i bought a pack of the jazz picks and a pack of these grip tips i really thought i d like the jazz picks better that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick but after trying them both i find these the grip trips are now my pick of choice they fit my grip perfectly stay put in my hand and give me maximum control when i play whether it s lead or rhythm i have yet to break one i m mainly buying another set because i ve given a few away for people to try and i want to have plenty readily available i like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations so whenever i pick up a guitar to play i ve got one close by also always keep a spare in my wallet bottom line is for me at least these picks are tops sure i can still use a regular pick when that s all that s available but why not use the best when i can update been using these picks for a year since my first review still love them still have yet to break one and i can be an aggressive strummer the only reason i need to buy more i lose them i have to admit they are a bit pricey compared to other picks but for me they are still tops which is why i m buying another half dozen what can i say it works i think i could write a book here not just a solid little mic holder glad i bought it i have played the guitar for nearly years now and wanted an inexpensive small body steel string guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling this one fills the bill pretty well build quality is quite good made in indonesia not china as i had expected and the intonation is perfect the finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well a pick guard is present but when i removed the plastic shipping protector the entire guard came up with it the adhesive residue comes right off so i will play the guitar without a pickguard bracing is light the entire guitar is light the body is a bit larger in the lower bout than i expected but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnought i take issue with some reviewers suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box the string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck cramping the fingers the nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more the action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully and just a little at a time this work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier but if you can do it yourself will improve the playability of the instrument the strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap so i replaced them with a set of d addario ej light phosphor bronze the improvement in tone was immediate this little guitar sounds pretty darn good all in all with some careful modification this is a good guitar for the beginner or casual player and a very acceptable one for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification him herself the strap is adjustable on both ends and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder i cut it off and glued the material back together with shoe goo and now it s great padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good strings they re all i use on my acoustic these custom light strings in particular give me the sound i wanted from my guitar i love these strings they sound awesome on my acoustic however they do not last long but that is the price you pay for a good sound not strings recommended for beginners due to the bigger gauge they have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better and they give u some spares these are a good value for quality strings strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in i m very satisfied d addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars and now my two mandolins consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand this has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar going to also last for a long time cause just a small amount goes a long ways seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website but there is no dealer anywhere near me so i bought one sight unseen from amazon based on the good reviews i m glad to say i can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design a traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction the narrow reverse taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom heavy look when viewed vertically back and sides are cherry with only a light stain and the binding is dark the top is natural cedar as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down it appears to be based on the martin outline but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout weight is pleasantly light and the semi gloss finish is comfortable to the touch players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard but those with small hands should consider the slim version with a neck narrower at the nut sound is what really counts however and this canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there the maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high quality fresh strings allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering and the truss rod required adjustment a long reach hex wrench is included if you are not experienced in these tasks a local luthier should do it for no more than or so based on sound playability once adjusted and construction quality this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range it is a real standout in value update dec the more i play this guitar the more i love it it delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought snap and once the action was dialed in the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding i didn t fully realize hindered my playing i am considerng replacing my takamine mini jumbo with a seagull equivalent i just slapped one of these on my reliced mim fender strat it looks very slick only issue is that it got scratched already after having it for less than a month this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle no adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument s size or arrived set for it simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place good value for the price i decided to try these because the normal picks i was using kept slipping out of my fingers that was several months ago i am still using these everyday pretty durable and reliable i do recommend these this little tuner is excellent very accurate i love it i have other tuners but this one is the best i didn t realize it was so small i was concerned when i first open the package because of it s size but this mini tuner is just plain amazing i m glad i bought it i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop it has two brightness settings illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
226	this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genz benz bass amplification company andy said that this product is far superior to any other he was right fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle amp also fixed the effects loop jacks which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose of its power on gigs not good after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating cleaning and coating effect on the components wow and no andy does not own stock in have affiliation with or represent in any way the manufacturers of de oxit nor do i i owned a boss graphic eq many years ago and never really took to it ah the folly of youth first this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid the sliders have a nice feel to them as does the on off switch if you have any tonal issues with your amp then a graphic eq is an easy solution no it won t make you love an amp you hate but if you re almost there or even just want to add some sonic variety you won t really realize how useful and vital a graphic eq is my rig right now is a strat and jazzmaster into a pro jr i love the amp but as the volume goes up the treble gets a bit piercing i ve been able to tame that issue with this pedal it s a subtle thing it takes some time to play around with the sliders and figure out what will really hit your amp s sweet spot at least in my application where i m leaving it on all the time this pedal would also be good for a solo boost as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch through overall for this price you can t go wrong this is one of those pedals that has a million applications and will always have a use in my setup i m thinking of getting a second one and building a pedalboard specific to my acoustic rig comp eq chorus reverb the biggest question i ask about these cables are they worth the premium charged above more normal cables the key to me is the lower end series monster cables monster s i standard inch instrument cable feet the answer is mixed and depends on what you are looking for the cable ends are very heavy they are metal and do unscrew in some ways this is probably good they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging the jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime on the other hand the series plugs are a molded plastic end with a good bit of flex to them and they are lighter weight so the choice is heavy shiny gold or light weight gray black for me i like the heft of these cables construction wise these are likely lifetime cables check out the pictures i ve posted the metal housing screws into the jack there is an o ring to seal the top portion of the threads inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war the wire is never separating from the jack i don t think the actual inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks sound is excellent they are clear clean cables are they better than the s oh maybe a tiny bit maybe a little clearer cleaner sound but it isn t a huge difference bottom line for gigging probably go with the s the jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace for practice or in your house these are probably the way to go they do look particularly good plugged into a marshall half stack these cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else monster cable study different one quarter inch jack cables and you ll see these are priced very close to everyone else this is not the case of the hdmi cables at the big box store for fifty times what you should pay for them it s hard to beat the quality of monster cables there is absolutely no discernible loss of tone through this cable i love it i love d adarrio strings great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers d adarrio strings rule see ya bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well product is as described and fits mic perfect will buy more in future it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights i really wanted to use it halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn t want it out on the porch next year these are a must have item heretofore i ve been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism while it s an innovative system that doesn t require any installation the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things i installed the schallers on my warmoth strat body i found that i needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit not a big deal at all these schallers are exactly what i wanted stars and a no brainer cheap crappy strap it s too stiff not comfortable at all i regret purchasing this save your money go hunt for a coach strap or something similar they are expensive but worth it great little mixing console for home use and practice i use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where i need to connect my guitar a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit this thing has phantom power just in case you didn t read that already overall i can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you d need and even has a british eq to help shape your sound a bit cons not many one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh you have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off apart from that the led is wayyy too bright so bright that you can t look at the device for very long and obviously can t make out the writing and control labels on the device i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led i recommend getting this unit and only gave it stars because of the few cons listed above not bad at all this unit tunes really well same as the boss original the only difference is that this one takes like sec to respond after the pedal is activated the boss is instantaneous other than that both units behave exactly the same some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor for those of you who do not want to spend on a tuner this one is just perfect since i am a collector i have other brands to compare boss korg fender and it is the same thing it is as accurate as the boss at least mine is and is a good mute switch also i am happy with mine between the blue and the yellow i have my needs covered these have a weird feeling when you first get them like they have powder on them but within minutes of using it it ll stick with you much better i love these picks
227	purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that still learning how to play but like the feel of this guitar looks great and plays great was packaged very well only needed minor setup adjustments i would recommend getting strap locks wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better the item shipped in time it is working fine the sound is very good the only problem i had is voltage i live in europe and i had to buy special adapter which transforms volts to i know a lot of items from usa that work with both voltage and but not this one thanks anyway as a new guitar player i have a lot to learn and after nearly dropping my guitar twice in about minutes because the strap sliding off the pegs research was needed based on reviews here and other sites i ordered these arrived quickly extremely easy to install and work as advertised would buy these again if when i acquire new guitars easy to use and the clip is sturdy a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it
228	the tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when i ve been playing a lot the problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pull offs less fluid a few strokes of ghs makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience an alternative would be using vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard also i sometimes use an emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but i d rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong ghs allows me to minimize that lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth it either cleans or it doesn t this cleans polishes all of my guitars great just make sure the strings are off so that this doesn t get caught on them this is a brand i ve come to trust this little music stand folds up small enough after some disassembly to fit in a pouch less than feet tall and inches wide once assembled it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you re standing seated on a stool or in a chair the angle of the tray is not adjustable the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location but for a portable stand it s hard to find fault with this one especially given the low cost but what you ask this tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily mine broke and so did my friend s it s probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to get a replacement clip this recorder is okay but it s far from perfect no i didn t expect it to be perfect but still i refuse to give it more than stars it seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely however other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible i use this to practice with a band and then i ll just listen to the arrangement later so i can practice by myself for this much i have no complaints besides that i would never use this if i wanted a decent quality recording of anything

230	this converts an xlr signal for me a shure sm mic into a male i run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall i have a pretty weird pedalboard set up involving an ehx digital memory man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain this does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before i go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be and they get very loud at the top end but i have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around i tested to see if i could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none i got a few of these as a christmas gift and they re just bad i put them on my pedalboard where i previously had longer cables and these just didn t stay in the jack i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these if i play loudly and my room vibrates a bit the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal awful i was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from joyo but took a chance on the eq i really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should i use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the eq but it can be used to get a scooped sound mids boost hi lowpass or whatever you need it s a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass when the pedal is engaged the lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enough i would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed not the performance side of the pedal as far as i can tell but for example the n on the in label on the right is backwards and it comes in a weird box with plenty of engrish so i m skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on time will tell but for now it seems like a great box for the money
231	got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar this is a great strap for the money they leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast if you want to spend more money you can and get a little better leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones nicer but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop a b good tension only con is that ernie ball strings seem to wear out fast and lose tone so for now i m good but in a few weeks i ll need new strings in which case i ll probably go d addario or cobalts still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast excellent guitar strings they last a long time sound great and are pretty cheap cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use still highly recommended for the money best articulate bass string for the money i have one of the first versions of the fender precision lyte bass from the s i have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued they sound great and stay in tune sound like rotosounds think roger glover geddy lee and chris squier nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick i am not a slap style player so i can t comment on that i set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible try them you ll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy i wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin these will work for soprano the j is a good investment for under bucks they provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play increases projection and tone to any stock strings not the best not the worse strings but an improvement i bought this during the black friday sale the price was right since if i was dissatisfied then i wouldn t be out that much money quality product well worth the purchase i would recommend this i ve picked up a few of these for my various guitars i ve found it to be steady and stable and it hasn t left a mark on either my large archtop or my les paul the little locking strap that goes across the neck cradle is a big plus too i ve seen plenty of lesser stands for more money so this one is my first choice these days this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn t really work as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag i know it says tenor now that i look at it but since i put soprano gig bag into the amazon search i figured i would be getting only soprano bags anyway it doesn t seem much more then a normal gig bag yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not not sure how well it holds a tenor since i don t have one mine is black not the almost purple the image shows i use to use a cloth to clean my strings this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool easy to open clamp on the strings run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets i understand that it s only plastic but i wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time i don t know if i see an issue i may update this a year or so down the line until then excellent solution i bought this strap for my new american deluxe plus stratocaster the strat is mystic ice blue with a maple neck and fretboard with the light metallic blue and the natural maple neck and fretboard the white strap looks great i m very pleased with it good basic first amp great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house compact size makes storage easy i figured i d buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one one of the cheapest prices on amazon and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has i was also hoping that it played well well i ve been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good and i ve had no technical issues what so ever i would recommend to anyone keep up the good work i recently purchased a epiphone eb bass and it didn t come with a case bag so when i found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine all in all it s an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don t want much padding just got three of these in today and compared one to a used fender standard one strap bag i also got in at the same time the chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the fender does not go thisextra step the chromacast also has many more pockets the specs on the fender and chromacast do not back up reality as the fender advertizes mm padding and the chromacast advertizes mm padding someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender this is a good medium class gig bag that falls somewhere in between a dust bag like the burswood and a deluxe mm padded bag the only thing the bag is missing is a hanger on the back which the fender does have chromacast should get rid of the plastic expensive hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone else this bag is good for in house and light use no throwing it around transport if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case at this bag is a steal
232	yes i think you should try these if you re looking at them then get them they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w o any pick experience i don t drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w o looking i ve been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade they re sturdy and convenient and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap the ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage or when you don t need the strap hanging from your guitar e g sitting in a chair works exactly as advertised i ve purchased several of these and can t say enough good things about the product and company sounds and feels nice i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster it came with entry level strings these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument be advised the low e string is thick when i try to depress the th fret i can t get it to register as a hit with rocksmith unless i press hard with my middle or index finger well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game just what i needed easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap works like a charm i recommend this product i use this tuner to tune up my violin other tuners i ve tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the e string vibrations thus making it hard to tune this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all strings
233	i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough these cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut i have several other good cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level i have grown as a musician to the point that i know it s worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables yes you can get many cables way cheaper and i m all for getting things at a good price publishers clearing house has not visited me yet but this is a case of you get what you pay for just exactly as stated this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand holds picks it is exactly what i wanted for a great price thanks editing this review to say that today i got a few thin picks and the thin picks do not hold in this mediums do great but the thin fall right out fine for me because i will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone elixir s nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings are the best strings i ve ever used on my alvarez acoustic a guitar i ve now owned for over years they certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there they have a nice punchy tone and are easy on the fingers unlike the elixir extra lights that i found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short scale guitar these seem like an ideal combination i may buy another set soon and restring the short scale instrument with lights compared with some brands and gauges of more old school strings there may be a little less bass response but these sound good pretty even through the set and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low e string so heres the thing that no one else wants to say the thing is built like a piece of s it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around i used this times and it shorted out the lights started flashing and it got hot i called line and they determined it was bad so they opened a ticket fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon well see how helpful they really are i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner these are the best tuners for the money the display is very stable and it s simply fun and easy to use this is my second and i love them so much they work flawlessley and tune is amazing get one and dont hesitate i have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others easy and quick no reason to be out of tune with these tuners the white is great but no matter what color they are they are a quality product rock on
234	it has what you want in a cable and not what you don t not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends so there it is nothing magical just a guitar cable i have bought three of these i managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand the connection could be stronger but it was my fault that i broke it they do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice nothing exciting about these things but they do the job well i polished my gibson les paul with this recently and i d forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was does a great job i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner these are the best tuners for the money the display is very stable and it s simply fun and easy to use i used this tuner as i transitioned from playing rocksmith to playing in the real world my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings with this tuner it doesn t matter if it is electric or acoustic it gives a very very accurate reading my luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it they were only off by units in any given direction very happy and pleased with this one it is more than i hoped for very nice protection for my luna it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat if you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new martin guitar this is a must have product i didn t want to have a hole drilled in a new martin guitar so this worked fine wit the martin leather straps actually i bought two of them it is a star product
235	this is the mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects can t believe it took me so long to get one of those i was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great they have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great it s almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these it sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers you don t want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition i like dunlop products i used the purple tortex mm almost exclusively until i met up with this jazz iii and now my personal debate continues i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is i like tortex and this isn t but i really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it i rarely and i do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times they make or picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips this is the new and improved jazz style pick and i am still trying to figure out if i like this or the trad fender jazz pick or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn t such a bad idea after all i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound i change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit i can go to weeks for hard playing i started using fender strings with the stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat they sounded great i use these for my telecaster in factory spec and they are real nice too i do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets i have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period stick to nickel and you will be glad you did old tech bungee type of capo inexpensive and works well you have to remember that banjos don t have a lot of tension on the neck to they really don t require a vice to get the job done works well on mandolin s too these are a lighter tensioned version of their popular j strings the pitch is somewhat lower than the j s and the effort needed to fret a note is much less nice for old fingers and beginners these original bullets are great for my strat they are made specifically for the fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect the strings sound great and hold up to the whammy just fine sound great and look great theres a reason why so many uke manufacturers supply these strings as standard on their best ukes they are simply the best there is for a fair price the sound brightens up and amplifies even the most dull sounding uke and allows for a smooth experience once stretched properly not much more can be said about these awesome strings stop reading this and order them
236	at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels solid recommend this if you re tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music i use this for my uke my string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty taylor easy to use very accurate highly recommended i have the fender mustang iv and i would say the fender is a superior modeling amp but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get the bass sounds great and when i played here comes the sun on my acoustic i d swear the tone sounded like the beatles record the modeling sound is ok and they tell me there s a looper here but i d have to pay an extra for a pedal to access it oops there goes a star for the con job peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less i ll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
237	i chose this rating because a fine paper towel seems to work just as well as this microfiber polish cloth despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box this is a high quality gig bag with plenty of storage space fits either a tele or strat i don t typically keep my guitars in their cases but bags like this one come in handy for gigs short trips moves etc nice styling touches too the bag has removable back straps for carrying ease any product that can make an intermediate level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment the rp is an amazing processor loaded with features looper drum machine tuner and dozens of cool pre sets greasr is my favorite you can customize your own sounds but i still haven t gotten tired of digitech s choices the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential i run my ipod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes sweet the control settings can be a little daunting at first but the owner s manual will walk you through the tough stuff bottom line a great toy this will work for just about everyone but i prefer the walker williams brand but these work fine easy to get strap locks on will keep on the side for next guitar you shouild be happy enjoy
238	if you need it good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap leather or simulated this was quite adequate for my purposes price was right delivery was immediate rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case this one is compatible with the finish on my instrument since it comes in at least two distinct color tones planet waves mandolin strap brown also comes in black there is also an embossed model brown offered at minimumly higher price these items though well made and strong are sized rather differently to national picks with the national i need a large so i ordered large in this item it is however very tight smaller in fact than a national medium thumb pick essentially a waste of money there aren t enough uke straps out there for a good price this one is great i take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller lighter i ordered two sets of these buttons to mount on two ukuleles a concert a tenor the buttons are good quality look nice and are easy to install the inclusion of the felt pad is important don t buy buttons without a pad drilling holes in your instrument might be a daunting thought but take it slow careful and you shouldn t have trouble check out this rather entertaining how to video to see the installation process for these particular buttons i used a drill bit for the pilot holes snug fit but imo not too tight i matched these buttons with this strap kala k stp bk black ukulele strapfor a perfect combination they sound pretty good they tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments easy to use portable cheap not exact in tuning might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican for most of us this is more than adequate these strings are great they are very mellow sounding and i like them a lot this is what came on my uke and i wanted to make sure i hade replacements i got both hi and lo g sets
239	this was perfect i am very happy with the hosa cfs inch right angle fx pedal cable pack i play a few stringed instruments and ukulele isn t one of them but after seeing so many great uke players lately jake shimaukuro joe brown i had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself i wanted a playable instrument and i didn t feel like spending a lot of money i ve tried ukes in stores that were big disappointments bad intonation no tone etc after reading reviews here and elsewhere i decided to risk a purchase result this is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks sure it doesn t have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top but it delivers good tone excellent intonation and good playability at a very good price it may not be a star intrument but it s a star value if you re thinking about trying ukulele but you re not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away i would strongly recommend an lu even after you buy a better uke this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests so that you can play ukulele duets i ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews i found it to be excellent for the price and so far have had no problems with the zippers this product is described as a soprano ukulele gig bag and that is exactly what it is a gig bag is not a rigid faa approved flight case nor is it a semi rigid polystyrene case with soft covering reviewers that don t believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a gig bag and don t understand the term you wouldn t put your reading glasses in a soft padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you i don t know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag but i found that it fits the soprano size perfectly it is very well padded for a gig bag having extra padding at the base of the instrument where the bottom strap button would be if you have one to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end it also has a nicely padded handle i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well ukulele not included they cost a little more than this i have a lot of guitar tuners in the house i ve had few handheld units some apps on my phone the korg pitch black some fender thing the boss tu and the tc electronic polytune i can say that the only tuner that i prefer over this one is the pitch black this little ca is actually faster and better than the tu by a hair and absolutely kills the polytune in speed and accuracy korg really knows how to build their tuners and this one is a truly great one works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric and also does a fine job on basses too i don t know if it s accurate enough for a piano but it is what it is
240	another quality product from hosa just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq i always like slightly longer length as i can always zip tie back but hard to stretch no noise from this cable good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice i really love this tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product recommended when i first saw this item i wondered why is the regular guitar version and the bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and i realized the bass version only has to tune four strings instead of six so it costs less because we don t need to use it as much but then i remembered there are string bass guitars and i thought okay shouldn t they have a one for string bass guitars sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when i realized with some dismay that there are even string bass guitars will this even work on a string bass after all that s more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool its function is three fold string winder string cutter peg pullerso no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably priced tool made by d addario the quality lives up to the brand it s solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed it does everything it s supposed to do does it well and is of good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons the winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use i would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening because of this design flaw stars instead of i note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys what i believe is that it is a mistake to sell the bass and standard guitar version on the same page from what i can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the bass guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity it s obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge the one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn t careful the same holds true for needle nose pliers bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they re doing don t get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using any modification tool i suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings to in seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didn t simply start a new listing when redesigning the device simple to use works well on the squier strat i m not much of a guitarist so this is my first capo and i don t have anything to compare with but the quality is way up there it s hard to beat the quality of monster cables there is absolutely no discernible loss of tone through this cable i love it this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on i ve been using this stuff for about years or so and i really don t play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy having a neck heavy epiphone sg g i really like this strap because it is not only comfortable but also provides enough friction to keep the guitar in place without much effort leather straps are good too but they tend to slide off the strap button this is a great invention i have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this it really saves on batteries and extension chords it is well worth the money this dunlop pick holder work good for an in expense product it is want i need for travel little hard to put picks in but ok i have always trusted the graph tech tusq products and this is no different the compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed the compensation built into this saddle makes another hit with graphtech tusq products for me they have done the hard work just needed some personal fine adjustments and good to go good sound quality for not being bone i have this hooked up to pedals so far and it s awesome real cost saver on batteries you really cant go wrong for the price this is a good micro fiber cloth but i guess because its from ernie ball it costs more than other clothes but if you are like me its all about my axes i have one in each gig bag case i don t recommend using with polish just a wipe down after each guitar or bass use seriously just stop don t be like me and wonder what all the fuss is for years just go ahead and get a pair they are just awesome when i finally got mine i opted for the anniversary edition as they were on sale and i am seeing the regular athm s right now for that s crazy cheap i had some rather inexpensive sony headphones for about eight years still have them actually that are comfy and sound good but not entirely accurate the athm s are really solid studio headphones i can t imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself they exude quality and are comfy even when i m wearing my glasss which many headphones are not not for long seasons anyway i use the athm s in my home studio and i have started taking them along in my gear bag for studio sessions along with a headphone ext cable i feel oso foolish having lived without these cans for so long don t you do the same this is really a no frills stand except the addition of a neck guard strap which is a nice touch it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable there s really not a lot more to say about it except that at i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed i would certainly not spend or dollars on a stand when i could buy one of these this is what i have needed for many years really well made very sturdy and will last forever and it is useful for all the guitar work i need to do i think it is reasonably priced as well thanks for a great product and good prompt service cheers they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill good buy for the price and nothing else is required good quality with sealed connectors it does not stick on to the guitar very well trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet bought a better pickup it performs ok although it takes a learning curve getting used to the strobe dial i found it too difficult to see from my pedal board i am over so eyes ain t what they used to be i was also disappointed to find there was no power plug just battery adding a spot power proved difficult as the only way to run the battery adapter is along the side where the pedal is pushed i fixed problem by taking my dremmel and grinding a groove just big enough for wires to be unobstructed for the above reasons i have elected to use this as my work bench tuner for guitar set up and have gone to the ashdown engineering tuner for my pedal board nice quality plug i used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals works great and no noise the shielding on these planet waves cables are great yea how could a music stand be amazing well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent it actually hold by song fake book you know the one that weighs about pounds it stays where you set it and works wonderfully no complaints i ordered this primarily for my string ovation bass first there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings my ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but i was finally got it on the bottom between the d g string tuners it does not respond well to an open b but octaves are fine and as long as i have confidence in my intonation it is no problem i tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on when i tried it on my ibanz solid body string i found it to be even less likely to read quickly or at all also worked great on my strings when i look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables so bright and festive i just feel beautiful all over again i needed a new stand for my home studio so i thought i was cutting corners when i purchased this one as it turns out this stand is practically indistinguishable from mybelmonte orchestra stand deluxein construction and material quality that stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review the stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians and is stable enough to use outside the rest tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments in fact i have attached analeratec universal tablet mountto hold an ipad with sufficient room left over for a page copy of thethe new real book volume and it holds those rock steady another feature that i like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand s footprint are not problems bottom line this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price i am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever i need another stand this is the model i will purchase
241	im not loyal to brands on the whole but when i reach for a pick i hope this is the one i get they wear out and get nicks so i have to remember to keep ordering them edit watch the steve vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn nicked picks rapidly firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet the motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick repeat or times and whadda u know the edge is now smooth and nice i ve written a review before they are excellent never broke a string but i only play at home as a hobby therefore they not abused it does a good job for it s primary purpose as a capo so i gave it four stars it works flawlessly but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn t easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood i have a lot of high end instruments and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying this stuff is fantastic much better than lemon oil dries a lot cleaner and doesn t leave any oily residue on the board at all an hour after it s applied it sets up and doesn t get on your hands i apply it on occasion with the strings on i use elixirs and have never once had a problem the best few bucks you ll spend on guitar care stars provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine does not leave streaks if used properly this dries quickly every time i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa i don t think that many people would do this the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box it works for me i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp yes finally after reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders i hit the nail ok i play in a really loud metal band none of us are record savvy or anything like that we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out but we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember that riff for the next rehearsal we tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice well the zoom h n changed everything simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just well incredible for such a little thing no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it i still need to read a lot of the users manual but take my word i hate those manuals i figure how to use it extremely basic and just hit the rec button and rock out finally when i came back home i plug it into my pc and i was amazed by the quality of the sound we recorded in ch mode with two extra mics and man i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet thanks zoom now rocking and basic recording it s how it s supposse to be simple and fun cheers it doesn t seem to be loud enough for a recording device that i have but other than that it works as described i am editing my earlier review i bought of these about months ago one works just fine no problems whatsoever i use it on every gig and at home the other has some kind of short in it it drains batteries almost overnight when i take the batteries out no problem tunes just fine but i am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test i contacted snark and marcy their customer service rep sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty excellent customer service they have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is i will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly good string action out of the box nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with the budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town so thanks to amazon for making this possible
242	hard to day too much but it works great no issues to speak of it does the job perfectly well good little connector cable well constructed durable built to last i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes worth it i use this one spot adapter with the pedal attachment works perfectly i ve seen reviews about this brand being noisy i suspect this to be happening with the pedal version too many for one simple volt source to handle i ve owned it for a couple of months used it at home days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times zero hum or buzz from the unit i should also mention that i do not have any drive distortion pedals on my board what can i say it does what it should pedals on a chain runs safely without crazy hiss and hum on my rig of course if you re running a chain of drive distortion pedals you re asking for it works great for me zero complaints as another guy said not better not bad simply different it s true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not like dunlop has a little bit of more wah range than behringer i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it more expensive than the behringer to my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer cheaper does not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparent more features than dunlop wha sound is not like the dunlop s it is different but nice i personally like so bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic good deal just get it i highly recommend it thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt behringer is a problematic company for me some of their stuff has been useful far beyond its modest entry level pricing e g a studio amplifier uca dac eurorack ub mini mixer and some of their stuff hasn t served me well at all e g gm amplifier btr rack tuner across the web reviews for the to are uniformly favorable based on this i purchased one instead of paying many times more for an ibanez ts this proved to be a good decision the to produces exactly the sort of sound enhancement that made seasick green justly famous creamy smooth to raunchy depending on my whim the same sound for a lot less money what s the catch i m a musical hobbyist the to will sit safely on my office floor and most likely never be actuated by my foot the behringer s shoddy plastic case and flimsy little control knobs for me are not liabilities if i was a gigging musician on the other hand i d want the tank solid construction of the real thing and its additional cost would be well justified i love this pedal that said i would like to address some of the reviews i see on here i have been playing guitar since i was years old i am now so i have a few years of experience first you guys who complain about the plastic housing are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals if you are stop doing it all you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works the plastic housing is extremely strong and won t bust when used properly the next thing i would like to address is the battery running down even when it s turned off every effects pedal i ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain it will save you a fortune the ones saying the sound sucked buy something besides a amp and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain thi is a good pedal and i ve used it on stage for years without a problem that means i have spent about a year for a pedal that has earned me thousands buy one learn how to use it and you ll be happy never has watts sounded so loud and clear never think it only hadan inch speaker just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices light weight easy to carry i love these things i have purchased several snarks of all different types fast accurate and a joy to use my young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one all snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner the sn also has a built in mic for use with any instrument such as trumpet sax clarinet etc i have other more expensive clip on tuners but the snark is by far my favorite
243	i ve been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over years ago i use both electric and acoustic the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will every once in a while i ll get a dead string i ll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge same thing with strings that break while tuning them up great set of strings i will stick with elixir strings whether it be electric or acoustic great brand and they know what they are doing i ordered different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks they have a very comfortable feel and great sound i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it this pedal has a solid feel under my foot and gives me the push back i expect when playing live gigs always welcomed is the fact is stays in place where i put it on both wood or carpeted surfaces
244	this pedal has been around for a long time and though the overall quality has declined as boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals the boss ds remains the staple image of distortion stompbox s the ds is a no frills tank of a pedal it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as michael moore stepping on it so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it this pedal doesn t replicate any type of amplifier it s not a marshall in a box or a mesa boogie or a vox or a fender from a tonal aspect it isn t complex or dynamic it will add plenty of grind to your tone and plenty of hum to go with it if you re looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your watt practice amp look no further if you have a decent tube amp look elsewhere because with this pedal you get what you pay for and it simply will not do a quality amp justice pros inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal cons lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast without the excessive hum and almost unusable tone control this would get stars i m not going to do any explaining about the science behind how this pedal works i m just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone this definitely isn t a boost and it s also not an eq the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone essentially this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing the lo contour knob doesn t increase the amount of bass produced by the amp rather it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass and low mid tone to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased but it hasn t you re just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh that s not to say that you can t dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something indeed it ll make those searing lead tones even better now i gave this product stars not because i ve had any issues with it or haven t been in any way unsatisfied with it but rather because it s really a fairly subtle effect at first i almost couldn t tell a difference between having it on and off with time i ve been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone but it doesn t make a night and day difference i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you re happy with and just want to make it even better this pedal won t make a cheap watt solid state combo sound like a tube half stack it won t make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before in conclusion though i definitely wouldn t put this pedal into the must have category it definitely improves the quality of my tone this is a pedal that i leave on all the time as it improves both clean and distorted tones sound just like an ibanez tube screamer to me many seem to complain about the plastic housing but i m fine with it seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so sounds great but i also have a berhinger ultra metal that i think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this note i use it with a marshall jmc head a marshall jmp head and a crate blue voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent i ve got some videos on yt if you search um jmp and blue voodoo out if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great hundreds of sounds to choose from tones bands specific songs sounds built in tunermanually adjust tone drive bass mid treble gain pitch chorus phaser tremolo tape echo sweep echo delay reverb and master volumemp inheadphone line outloop recordingvery versatile and very fun twang to slayer in a flip of a preset
245	alright for the past years i ve been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string and let me tell you doing this process on guitars sucks this tool is awesome it takes about minutes to change strings now and it s well made and durable the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine i ts not perfect but neither am i so stars would recommend to anyone great case didn t really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about holds my seagal s very well great guitar by the way for the price but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy the padding is done very well nice strap i meant its just a basic strap so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far should last a while with good care
246	plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a lepai amp not much else i can tell you by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing my son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar it hasn t failed him yet it s easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly he says it s a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings highly recommend perfect thickness and action what else can i say you won t be sorry you got these they are all i ll get from now on easy to install holds the guitar away from the wall somewhat and keeps it off of the floor away from the animals when i have it out of the case great find well worth the purchase price best inexpensive right angle cables out there i use these in my lesson room at the music store that i teach at they will last forever if you take care of them this is a black sponge for smaller mics i got mine for use with some behringer mics at first i didn t think they would fit but it just took a bit of stretching they fit really snug which is excellent because they won t fall off or slide around on the mic causing noise they do what they re supposed to do i bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold shure sm and sm however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise these clips are in from front to back in comparison the shure clips are in to in from front to back so the shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well my favorite string from back in the s when i had my own guitar shop great strings and the best packaging nice mic good quality no problems and have used this heavy over the past year sounds identical to my shure sm but much less the beringer mixer is by far the lowest costing and best performing mixer for the price on the market works fantastic and i am very happy with it the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile dj s for the price and quality i would buy two other ones very nice pop filter i use it on all my condenser mics it works perfect for those hard p s and strong s sounds it s built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand it makes deessing a lot simpler when mixing vocals and it looks very professional i wouldn t be on the mic without it now that i know of the big difference it makes having it this is a very good investment everything just sits in this case so i never have to set up any cables again all i do is setup the input from guitar to the case from the case to the amp and let s not forget the power cable it works amazing and saves plenty of time i ve also seen reviews that it s very druable so you don t have to worry about it breaking easily i love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals such as wah or volume the only concern by some people was a slight buzzing i replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals and the sound went away i would recomment this to anyone who travels alot doesn t have a lot of space in their room or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time this item is very convienent this thing works wonders if you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot i recommend i hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels and this just is perfect for the job the pedals are all easy to press and i love the volume wah in pedal i just use it as a volume because i already have a wah pedal the tuner works amazing as well i also love the fact that it connects to your amp via rj ethernet cable this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers
247	this is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage transport and it cradles the guitar nicely two minor issues personal gripe the git leans back a bit more than i would like makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more d space than it really needs product gripe the two footer bars are not quite level with each other so it rocks just a little bit however with a solid body electric on it even a little rocking can be a really bad thing i like onstage and own several of their products they are well constructed and a good value so i have no doubt i was just unlucky with this one i ve been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it s getting better but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn t want to give much kinda sucks that it s not level out of the box so stars i m not a performing musician so i actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand holds everything from a mm nylon pick to a mm rubber pick and i have yet to see one fall out simple solution to a simple problem this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand of course one might think that would translate into sturdy and one would be correct super simple to use no buttons levers or knobs just pop it open it doesn t have an actual mechanical locking feature but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place it holds my acoustic securely and i have no fear that it s going to tip over on its own when you re done just nudge the outer legs to unlock them and it s super easy to fold back up i had a fender mini acoustic stand but it didn t fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so i figured i would try this one i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter however i can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a thickness if hercules could have figured a way to avoid that this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine it s still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag but i think the marketing guys used a little creative license with that description either that or they re comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed i m a beginning player so i m trying to make things as simple as possible starting out i was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic and really didn t want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks this strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar the ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issue the locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button to attach put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed your strap is now locked in place to remove it hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position that s it really it s that simple i m a taller guy and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should i need it longer at some point the leather feels robust and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box can t wait to see how it does after it breaks in this was a great choice and i couldn t be happier i ll be honest here i bought this one primarily because of its looks not a lot of white clip on tuners around i also own an sn and in comparing the two the sn seems to be as tight but it s only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the sn which has more features for a few dollars less than what you re paying for the sn still it s a typical snark it registers very quickly it s easy to read and you don t have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration the stem on mine is a little looser than i would prefer but it still stays in position my only real gripe isn t unique to this model but to all snarks the curved stem combined with the round head means it won t sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren t exactly robust so i m always concerned that one day i m going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces other than that i d recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner
248	put a set of these on my rogue grand concert now the guitar stays in tune beautifully worth every penny they are grovers they keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock i like the vintage look of these and they go great with my gibson custom sg i have grovers on all but of my guitars this is what i have been looking for for my accoustic guitar makes my life easier when i pack up and set up the equipment this is a great guitar for the money it has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments the built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound i would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it not much to say here they re knobs they look good are well made and fit perfectly on the cts pots in my guitar
249	sounds ok on its own not very loud or good quality at any high volume but then when you plug in some good headphones awesome great gain tone high volume sounds awesome perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect great sound awesome deal score d i snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price i previously had thelucero lc classical guitar black black which i was completely happy with as a beginner when it got damaged beyond repair i looked into thecordoba dolce size classical guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but i decided i didn t really like the size so after liking the cordoba brand i decided on the c it is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range the lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the c has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that i was surprised to hear from a budget guitar while it isn t it the prettiest guitar out there it s by no means ugly even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar the smell of this guitar is also amazing it doesn t have the cheap wood glue smell of other low end guitars but a nice rich smell of wood even after a few months kept in a humicase the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present all praise aside it is not a flawless guitar my main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars especially those at a lower price range not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of being a cedar guitar the wood is very soft so i recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar i do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package it is a high quality gig bag with lots of padding inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place it also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books when i ordered this guitar from amazon the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box i had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely overall i do not regret this purchase and once i take it in for a setup to get the action lowered it will be a superb guitar that i will enjoy for years highly recommended great little tooland very handy a bargain and a good buy does not mar my guitar and is easy to see thanks as a musician you wonder how accessories like a capo which have been around for centuries can be improved sure enough the planet waves capo has a feature where you can manually adjust the tension when a capo doesn t have enough tension it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing initially the planet waves capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first i mean shouldn t it just immediately work after i figured out what worked best for my instrument the capo worked like a charm an additional feature of the planet waves capo is that there is a clip for a pick which is handy if you don t already have an attached pick holder i like it and recommend it for those who might move their capo around to different instruments that have varying neck dimensions
250	to start with i didn t buy this guitar because it was cheap but because of the unbelievable reviews i don t know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past i have owned and sold my gretch my yamaha my ovation but i won t be selling this one i ve had it for months now and haven t adjusted anything only played this string from american musical supply amazon it is the best playing best sounding string i have ever played period this guitar set off a couple of other epiphone purchases one for my son aj sce s and es also great guitars most of my life epiphones were dull over coated junk not anymore and it seems that epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them i own gibson studio les paul sg american strat martin d washburn rogue all nice guitars most for a lot more money this guitar is a nobrainer cannot believe the value american musical supply is also great the first aj sce came in with a bad neck and ams emailed a return fedex lable in an hour and after i dropped it off and it was logged in at a ups outlet around the corner i got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way when it arrived days later it was a good one star service adds a little sustain and they look sharp but not gaudy put them on my martin d epiphone aj sce and washburn travel series ro tr nice picked up some blue steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone also was the last to pick it up for shipped to my door if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you the case is kick ass too easily a value update after putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner along with putting on new strings this guitar rocks putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone this is my go to guitar sounds good and has great intonation the only fore seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning i have a washburn d and love this just as much for the cost works great and looks great low price so overall i would recommend it to anyone that needs a soft case about ten years ago i installed strap locks on my first guitar fender stratocaster they worked well and were easy to install i subsequently installed dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation i had to drill additional holes no two guitars gibson sgs ouch this made me take a second look at schaller the components beginning with the screws are of much higher quality than dunlop it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice i should have gone with schaller from the beginning i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results it is a hardshell case about what i expected decent low end hardshell but serviceable i wouldn t check in with an airline i can lean on the top and push it in for a little extra protection over a gig bag yes don t put an amp on top of it in a van though inexpensive and practical you don t have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this just about any angle will work needs little space another plus
251	bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price used this foot pedal for a and so far i ve had know problems replaced the battery only once good product for a inexpensive foot pedal these are pretty good quality tweed cables i prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs they also make one with the degree inch input as well as is the case with all tools you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter it s extremely well built and performs its task very well pros extremely high quality metal comfortable rubber grips red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag of tricks effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringscons has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage the tool is spring loaded to open while this may be a plus for some people i find it less than ideal overall this is an extremely well made tool for your guitar kit if you re a bassist that likes stainless steel strings you ll appreciate how they cut like butter this product does what it is designed to do very very well it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments it works better than my piano i can trust that i will be in tune
252	this is a fine product any guitar player has hands strong enough to use it looks great on the guitar and works really well recomended i have used all kinds of strings these are what i use on a regular basis they work they sound great and their longevity is impressive most of all they are cheap this is a very secure and almost comfortable there should be a pick pocket on both ends but it is a nice feature the strings on my new yamaha fg s were too hard and noisy so i ordered these and what a difference in the feel playing went from painful to pure pleasure i did notice that the tone of the low e string was a bit dead especially in drop d tuning so i put that one yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows for that i gave four stars instead of five this is great but i needed an actual sound hole cover i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt sound hole cover though only using it for a short time i did notice the bottom end seemed more focused
253	i have one of these in every one of my cases it s a plastic sponge holder with holes in it nothing special but it does the job this device is ok it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable convenient storage is its biggest plus its easy to set up and use simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it i re soak it easy weeks or so can t tell if it s truly working on my maple wood ukulele
254	i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect i hit the strings very very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet i don t break many strings it a simple holder that it s really good to make sure that you will not be out of picks when you need then it works great not much i can say beyond that can t beat these stands they are a bit troublesome to open and collapse the snap buttons are hard to depress but once open they stand up well since i don t travel much they are great if you use your guitar in a studio and don t travel around much it seems like such simple concept but so many companies cannot get it right it s just a spring and a handle but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brand this one worked very well for me and at this price i am able to have a couple extra lying around
255	i used to swear by hard and stiff picks on my les paul custom but i recently bought a strat re issue and these are too mucch fun for fast rhythms with a wah or phase phaser pedals quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather does exactly what it s says it is a good piece of kit for a very good price had no issues in the months there is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your real picks which helps with its looks bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price i ordered this product on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday came very well packaged and with all the pieces i was very easy to assembly and looks great for the price you really can t go wrong with this guitar stand works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar the added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won t fall off padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected great stand for the price
256	i like thin picks myself and this one is very thin you won tuse it all the time but every now and then it can be used in the right situation if you are a player who is somewhat meat fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off it is ideal also if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar it is awesome no power chords with this little guy but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it the non slippery texture and it s grippy textured surface of dunlops is what i love about them the most it makes them easier to hold on to i give them a thumbs up these just happen to be my favorite i always keep mm mm and mm sizes on hand mostly use the s i ve been using them for years and so will probably never change i like the grippiness of them i hate smooth picks picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos i m truly surprised by all the good reviews here i m not sure how it s possible i ve already outlined below in my original review that these are not jim dunlop capos i had purchased two which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring both capos had this very same problem when i received these capos i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand name printed anywhere on the product as a professional musician i need to purchase reputable brand name products because i can t afford to have my gear failing during performances i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand and no measurable reputation when i contacted the seller they were not honest with me as i am one of those forever beginners when it comes to playing a guitar i may not be able to tell you all that this capo does the reason i ordered it is to hold my strings so i can set my guitar i may play around with it to see what all it does good price just as described this tuner is awsome it tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner
257	yes you really replace your strings very fast with this winder and it also cuts the strings very helpful i recommend these are my favorite brand of strings when i was a beginner a few years back these were the st strings i bought on my electric since i used them on my acoustic and i have to say elixir is my favorite brand of strings they last long are easy to tune have a nice bright sound if you take proper care of them wipe them down when your done playing keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it etc that bright sound can last about months or more i usually just buy about two sets a year im a heavy player i play about hours everyday i love the coating aswell but the medium gauge up usually don t have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings but overall these strings are awesome are a must buy for every guitarist this strap is value for money i was surprised when i got it i didn t expect something so good at this price the material is shiny blue and doesn t look cheap and the strap is generously wide the ends are leather with one side having a golden eb logo goes well with my black squier strat highly recommended i just ordered three different guitar straps online one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself then i found this and decided to get it the strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff i got this and switched over ahhh this is a guitar strap i see why you pay more it is so soft and comfortable it looks amazing this is just a great product i would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar thanks they sound just like i thought they would i love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome i would buy these again this amp is non stop fun has so many features i head to the s and it has all the sounds i like for that decade it sounds great at low volume and has some amazing models that sounds like the real thing well its a stand its super cheap and i don t mean the price the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well instructions were ok came with more parts than what were required all holes filled and i have of of each part extra the guitars do not sit very well in this stand i will use it until i can find a better one it will get replaced i really should send this pos back to amazon the concept is great but the execution of it sucks it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand there are better options out there for something portable this stand is worth tops if i had it to do all over i would save my money great selection of dunlop picks it was a good choice of finding what type of picks i preferred didnt know until i sampled quiet a few
258	i think this patch looks cool on the bass i don t really hear any difference in sound but does give your drum head a better life span nice cymbal better price i m no metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag these cables work well for my guitar keyboard and drums they appear to hold up well under constant moving i will be getting more bought this distortion pedal for our son who plays his electric guitar daily he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use it also produces a nice distorted sound quality and tone i don t know if i would agree as my generation hails from a different genre of music but he loves it and i guess that s all that matters i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy i would think it would work even better with a mic the display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle maybe i m using it wrong but ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs but from there it works great just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a good angle
259	total flimsy junk it leans wayyy too far back i ll be damned if i put my guitars on these things on the other hand chromacast makes one that s very close to this price and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid in summary do not buy this piece of junk i love these strings i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these i really enjoyed them after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase no desire to test other strings especially after this bundle value i have k k pickups in other guitars this is the first one i ve bought that had the smaller transducers it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers like other k k pickups it sounds darned good with a decent pa head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking the pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack this one comes with an ingenious diy installation jig made from i m not kidding cardboard golf tees and double sided tape it makes placement a snap the best pickup is still an external mic but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer you can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound i m looking for i used to buy all shure products i m switching to gls they are just great great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels very solid way cheaper than i saw in guitar center im very pleased with this stand i bought two i really wanted this to be a great product the screws strip out too easily basically if you put a microphone in it and ever have to use it for a microphone it is going to strip out i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon nope even the pop filter fell off i love the design but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage ex adjusting the position of the mic picking up a mic stand and moving it etc otherwise don t have an adjustable tilt option just make it one solid piece i m tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design it s just not strong enough not that it s a surprise though not much of anything is worth the money these days it s a damn chore to return every friggin purchase these days that they don t really have to care about actually testing products why should they they already have your money i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un boxing and packing things back up besides what are they going to do replace it with another broke a product better yet refund my money for the product i paid minus shipping that doesn t include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place i want a refund plus an hourly wage whatever don t buy one companies that don t test their products don t deserve your business what would make me happy is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question s did you test this product how did you test it what were your results is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence nope
260	the title says it all it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks also since these picks are smaller i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out these worked fine the mistake i made was buying them hastily i needed nylon core strings not steel my mistake i loaded them up anyway sounded great i finally bought into the monster cable hype albeit with a practice cable i can honestly tell a difference that difference being silence no abnormal hissing or popping that i got from my other cheaper cables this isn t the top of the line monster but still a step up from what i d been using i ll definitely upgrade my longer cables to monster and may even see how the expensive one sounds a short one st of course
261	stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time these hangers are easy to install just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business the stringed instrument becomes easily accessible and safe these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play behringer has done it again the pp ultra compact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like it s ultra compact it takes up a very negligible amount of space it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component in its compactness though it does not sacrifice usability it has no trouble amplifying a turntable s signal to line level before buying a preamp amp could only boost my turntable to a easy listening level the noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary with the help of this preamp my amp no longer acts as a crutch and i can comfortably listen to music without my amp s i m turned up to and struggling noise the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point it s not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look it also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference unfortunately there is no option to buy it in black judging from the accessible screws on the side though it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if i wanted this preamp also does not have a power switch but this is not much of an issue it s one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product summary if you need a preamp buy this one it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps i just got this thing and have only learned the basics of looping i ve done two jams so far but i can already tell it s an amazing tool for any serious guitarist the reviewer shawn in pa hit the nail on the head with his comment that he s playing guitar twice as much and getting twice as good that s a great compliment on this pedal and i agree what i especially like about this pedal is that it feels like it was the missing link in my collection of gear and brings it all together i m using my guitar my mixer my bass my drum machine my monitors whereas before just doing recording seemed like a bit of a chore this thing really puts the fun back in playing i think this is the one piece of equipment that will really bring out my creativity and i can t wait to see what i come up with with my new band the product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the job it was intended for service was more than expected these patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like band aids kind of a gross plastic smell the smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first
262	works really well this is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something you can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready the dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition and looking great it also had two soft cloths that are needed for application removing excess and polishing i couldn t be happier this product works just fine spring loaded so load the picks up wish they would hold a couple more but im happy i keep in guitar case and very handy to have enjoy this is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double leather ends the color stands out well on the black background available in various colors i bought the wrong pack was supposed to buy the light medium pack but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best my favorite pick out of this bunch was the dunlop jazz pick it would be great if the item name was changed to like dunlop med heavy pick variety pack but that might be me being too picky
263	great for beginners and experts the sound is great and is easy on the fingers i got them recommended by a friend the picks are good they are a little flimsey but are ok the best thing about them is the look i love this thing it quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument i own electric acoustic guitars electric acoustic bass guitars it clips on securely is easy to see stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on off from the front you can barely notice it at all i just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed when i switch to another instrument i un clip it and take it with me to what ever i want to play next i love this thing love it love it love it yes dear reader this stand will work as a good support stand for not only my grand concert size acoustic guitar for my five string banjo with resonator and also for my baritone ukulele the stand is sturdy provides good support and looks good i am pleased with my purchase and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
264	ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life my playing sucks sounds better with these strings bright and warm at the same time great tone easy on the fingers this does some fairly cool things to the sound but there is a lot more out there this would be great for a new person experimenting with effects great price and quality it is nice to not have to connect two pedals inches away with a cable no complaints whatsoever product is a solid build and prices right knobs work well and the stand doesn t slip legs hold up pretty well also very very useful like seriously unless you are very very good you can quickly get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear ernie balls strings at a great price nothing more to say not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar
265	i buy dunlop locks pedals straps they all are top quality and i love them all you need a strap strap locks or pedals buy dunlop wonderful tuner i ve used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all incredibly easy to use super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go well worth the price i have a home brew pedal board with pedals on it this allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems the blue led lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions not a bad price either
266	i ve only used the string winder so far but it works well so far i use it on my guitars and my banjo the other things look like they will work well but i haven t used them yet so i can t say for sure if not then i ll update this review if i can i read some of the reviews and that people almost had to guess what strings were what however on the bag that it comes with to prevent corrosion and on the box itself have a color coded guide saying what string is what color on the nut the strings themselves are the normal color for strings i ve ahd this cable pair for more than years and have had no problems with them at all i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones here are their key points good quality construction secured heads very long cable no signal problems overall great cable buy with confidence my hartke vx cabinet was designed by an idiot million pounds and no casters not even holes for them who invented this thing he man anyways i bought these casters got out the drill and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp pounded these in and now it rolls sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when i push it like a car missing a wheel but its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing of course we practice at the drummer s house and in his basement so i still have to carry it down and up his stairs but that s life i ve used this mic with my tascam us audio interface and pc to record a high school chorus concert and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone i placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone and one as a piano instrument microphone and have gotten great results from both the reproduction of the sound was very good the mic seems very solid in build and able to possibly take a little abuse which is good with a travelling recording system but i definately wouldn t try dropping one even though they re a nice metal case and metal grill i d recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals and instrumentals on a budget i have yet to try these with micing guitar amps but that s my next step as well as drums
267	great cable for patching in and rocking out it is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well recommend to anyone looking for a good quality without an over the top price cable i ve had two of these tuners they are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners they re durable and have a long battery life unlike most other tuners in noisy environments they don t lock in on higher pitches before lower ones again a plus for low instrument players the one problem that i ve had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to a to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as a strange easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators this tuner did just fine with the low b on a string bass some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency although this light is a little pricey in my opinion it really gets the job done i do like the fact that you can use batteries or a cadapter to power the light the nine led s really light up my music stand the carrying case that comes with it is well made makestransportation keeping it stored easy r joyner
268	you are looking at what i consider to be the best friend a voice ever had during a year broadcast and voiceover career i have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the shure sm b and it s predecessors the sm and sm large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi track studio work i ve used over the years the sennheiser md ev re ev re n d shure sm b shure sm shure sm and most recently tried a heil pr sometimes this was not of my own selection but i just used what was available of the lot the shure sm b is my favorite of the ones still available the sm b is a better shielded sm and the sm b of today has a better shock mount than the old sm or earlier sm b the shielding in the b model minimizes rfi from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc the sm was a redesign of the sm i consider the sm to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn t been in production in ages i have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the rca dx and rca but they were not as good as the sm or sm or sm b today s sm b is the best non condenser vocal microphone still in production stop looking and buy one you will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the ev s i can play a sm b like a violin the others i just don t seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an sm b while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn t dj s change jobs a lot and i got tired of finding the ev re re n d mics or the sennheiser everywhere i went so i bought my own sm b i never liked the ev s or sennheiser much and didn t ever feel like they were much of a tool the heil pr is pretty good but doesn t have any on board eq options for recording not having the eq is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can t do much of that the sm b is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an re n d but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the sm b is only dynamic large diaphragm mic i know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work the others are more versatile but the sm b is the voice microphone and that was all it was intended to be it has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphone of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably that is one reason vocals sound good on a tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multi frequency overtones of the human voice unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn t intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise if you are doing a dry voiceover you can t hide the hiss of a condenser under something else with the sm b you don t have to even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves recording engineers today are usually totally ignorant about they figure anything short of a multi thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong if you want a good all around microphone this is not it if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is as others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear i ve ever connected to it i think if you have some cheap usb interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers most real studio preamps are a good match for it i ve plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too you need at least db of gain the spec sheet actually says db would be better lots is made of the low output of db but it isn t all that much less than the shure sm which is db db isn t much at all for any decent mic preamp but again most of the one box solution usb interfaces with built in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind the shure sm b comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra they all need an external windscreen but only the sm b comes with one i got mine years ago when it still came with two windscreens it has a nice metal case for storage travel i think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one shure calls the a ws but still come in the metal case i use the smaller windscreen mostly and shure calls them the rk and their distributors still carry them the smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and i d suggest getting one of the rk s but that is the only accessory you ll need to add the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged they are also very durable for foam screens on the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple eq adjustments for flat bass rolloff presence boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best you can just leave the plate off if you want this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic so i m just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work i should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new heil pr first to make sure i was still an sm b guy and it took a while for the heil tryout to happen since i didn t want to actually buy one i still am an sm b guy i would give it stars but it won t let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class i rounded it up to stars but the sm was actually a bit closer to a star vocal mic the price was most definately the main draw i am very glad that i placed the order these people are pleasant to work with these headphones are wonderful to wear they sound great but that s not enough now a days with the head band being connected to the outside of the muff they fit your head so wide the pioneer hdj has the look read my review on those though they are terrible at first glance these things are serious pro grade they are made of very durable components both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head the head band isn t bad it s a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued not really a big concern though they have a long cord and i ll talk more about it later it ends with a spin on in or a standard mm the sound out of these things is pristine it s not muddy and very clear they have a good amount of bass because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don t leak noise like a lot of headphones do pros heavy duty awesome sound comfortable headband over ear design not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag always clear never muddy even at high volumes very clear left and right ear markings spin on plugcons heavy coil cord heavy weight never got annoying though looks first i don t like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my fender blues deville sound distorted they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal there s a difference think about it if you don t get it second i don t like having a lot of pedals i play in a rock country band were we play music that sounds like neil young tom petty ccr etc just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of chords and an occasional minor th i just want an overdrive my digitech bad monkey and my arion tuner but i need distortion when we do covers ac dc hendrix etc the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to but of course then it s too loud based on those criteria the digitech cm is perfect the classic overdrive setting allows me to sound like hendrix or rocking neil young or any other rock band from the s and s the modern setting allows me to sound more like s and s rock e g guns n roses and soundgarden and this is important both settings make my amp sound like it is being overdriven it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point it sounds fricken awesome it does not sound like an amplified pedal so i can use the bad monkey i ve reviewed it on amazon if you want to read it for boosting my clean sound i use the cm if i want to play dirtier and for covers two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want i m happy
269	yes these strings are amazing i discovered these on my new taylor and now i ve put them on all my gits they really are the better string i was a fan of ernie ball on my electrifieds and d addario on my acoustics but no more i m only using these they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings but it s worth it i purchased this pickholder for my son who has a nasty habit of leaving things in places they don t belong the holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find best purchase i have made i ve had this thing for several weeks and just now when it fell off the table for the th time i tossed it in the trash the whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber it s not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck and it s not heavy enough to stay put even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over unless you glue this thing to the table or something like that it s useless even worse than useless it s in the way addendum i raised the rating a bit after hearing from the distributor manufacturer at least these guys listen
270	there seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case one reviewer says it s made by fender i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on show me proof someone else seems to think it s made by epiphone sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesn t make cases they accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost i have several epiphone dots and a gibson es i bought epiphone cases for all of them i found the gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case i couldn t see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case although the cases have the epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by tkl how do i know that you re wondering they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment that s been a few years ago the cases you get now could be made by a different company the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet epiphone s manufacturing standards so it s got to be good this case will fit the dot casino sheraton and the gibson es anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the epiphone joe pass emperor ii has a much thicker body than the dot this case was not intended for the emperor ii it s a great case and will protect your guitar but it s not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway both guitars fit perfectly good price for effect if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you i have amps that have this feature that due a better job i prefer woven cables for looks they have a nice stage presence hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables i don t move around on stage so the feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer this cable is just a little stiffer than some i have but that s ok for me and i m sure it will wear well if you move around on stage this is a really strong capo the spring is very robust well padded and will not damage your instrument i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin takes some hand strength to open it but you don t want a weak capo one of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune with this little gadget there is no guess work clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune i love this little gadget and the price is super on amazon i was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when i was thinking about buying it but i read all the review on it and decided to give a shot i figured for the price in late nov that it wouldn t be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because i bought it to play around with while i visit my family in ca when i opened it i was pleasantly surprised the guitar came in great shape it was packed well and didn t have any damage on it the top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it but it doesn t affect the performance of the guitar it came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once i lowered the action on the guitar it was much easier to play the sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight overall i m extremely pleased with my purchase it sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much the pick guard looks a bit cheap but that s just nitpicking if you want a cheap guitar that sounds great i totally recommend this one i am extremely happy with this purchase i honestly don t know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too i ve seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more this is a hard shell tolex covered case they are sturdy well padded with plush black lining and look as good as cases costing much more these cases are made for dreadnought guitars and i bought two of them one is for my ibanez ak g arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly the case has brass latches and one is lockable and comes with keys it s made in china but isn t most everything these days i wouldn t recommend it for airline railroad baggage but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions i don t think you ll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else don t be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases the danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with v to v by giving less power to them you can get some really spooky sounds great fun but can also help give you your characteristic sound i also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it like other adapters do the price is great i m planning to have several of this
271	this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice so please buy it if you want ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset i would not returned because i don t feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn t do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for i purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present so far so good you can t beat the price thanks this capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck for example a les paul or most acoustics for thinner necks like a strat or tele it works ok but has to be positioned just right to prevent string buzz it s not the ole clip it and go capo i m used to i bought this to have a capo i could just leave clipped on my acoustic s head for use when needed no dice neck too thick it s a washburn dreadnaught we re not talking some funky string jazz guitar bottom line it s cheap as dirt and you can make it work if you don t mind having to place it just right my advice spend a few bucks more and buy one that s easy it does what a guitar tuner should do it simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that s about half price better deal if you don t just buy one and have to pay single shipping
272	i was very skeptical to buy a wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non existent that being said the china i received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy the top part spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again the pinstripe heads are amazing i will buying them for life they are very durable and sound great the emperor x snare head on the other hand is junk it makes my snare sound like a high tom almost hate it these wires definatly change the sound of the snare drasticly improving sound as well as looks very satisfied with my purchase
273	while this is not a tape delay it s a solid pedal that gets it done it s way better built than other pedals in this price range i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals i figured i d buy a cheap second guitar so i found this one one of the cheapest prices on amazon and i thought wow what a great look this guitar has i was also hoping that it played well well i ve been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good and i ve had no technical issues what so ever i would recommend to anyone keep up the good work
274	the rosin does the trick and it s cased in a nice wooden holder so it shouldn t crack easily unlike those round rosin containers totally awesome strings i ve heard other strings are great too but i highly recommend everyone try these if you haven t outstanding string life superior sound ease of sliding i get these strings every time elixirs for life i d pay double for these strings all day i ve been using the schaller strap locks on my guitars since the s they give me a sense of security knowing that my guitar strap is totally secured to my guitar i consider it cheap insurance what else is there to say they are easy to use they are easy to install and they are easy to check i ve tried them all and these are the only ones i come back to no expensive pads to buy just use water simple to drop down into the body of guitar no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole comes out as easy as it goes in i have of them love tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank i ve had it for over years and done many gigs and a couple tours and all my tc pedals are in perfect condition now for tone this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when i m leading worship n my band we play heavier music so i was messing around with this overdrive so i could use it there as well and i discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal it makes your tone really muddy but if you send a dirty tone overdrive or light distortion into it it screams beautifully
275	other than that when you need rack screws these are the real mccoy wide enough pan to grab the ear narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear thanks raxxess we bought this rack tray for our son s new sound rack it is solid and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet it is a short shelf so it only goes about half way to the back of the rack cabinet he uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet does a great job of checking cords was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash tests multiple types of cords also if you are using electro harmonix red witch voodoo labs or the larger mxr pedals they won t fit in the styrofoam cutouts you can though just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board i also have a morley wah and they have big footprints so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board if you have a cry baby though everything should fit a little more comfortably right now i have the morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals i own and that four of them are a little outsized mxr ten band eq ehx electric mistress seymour duncan tweak fuzz there is some hum but it isn t so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound so for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters except a dod malmsteen preamp overdrive this is a great deal of course the durability is still in question at this point we bought this stand for our son s new guitar amp mic and it works fine for his set up it comes with the mic clip to hold the mic as well the height adjustments seem to work flawlessly
276	this is great for keeping your pedal board more organized all you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in summarygreat pedal buy it you ll probably keep it at its price point stars i am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds it reminds me a lot of how i used to set up my super reverb amp compared to all pedals i d actually give it stars downgrading star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the rise control but i liked it so much i decided to score it at its price point pros dirt cheap at for a new pedal sounds great does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise i wish i could say the same for some pedals i ve tried latched unlatched mode the best feature on the pedal i love that i can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts small form factor normal single pedal size standard power supply v center negative runs from pedal board power or a battery the larger foot pedal surface compared to just a silver bullet switch is nice for the unlatched mode usecons cheap plastic case i doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case latched unlatched switch is small hard to reach have to bend over can t do with a toe rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound probably not needed on this pedal two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability like most pedals the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe and the settings are hard to see my favorite pedals have large knobs well marked settings you can see from a distance enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another and in the best cases enough space size and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump suggested redesign super vibrato or vibrato ii change to a metal case lose the rise control altogether put the latched unlatched modes on a nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes increase the size of and space between the other two controls put large foot controllable knobs with high visibility knobs then again at bucks i might just buy a nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique stand alone sound the chorus effects are well known and even included on many amps and featured on almost every multi effects pedal i like the individual pedals because i can add in just what i want instead of relying on someone else s idea in a pre set this chorus is just about right it has a range of sounds for different situations and is very reliable and well made there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases if you want a metal housing it s for some sentimental reason thinking that metal is automatically better or more durable than plastic you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs if you want u kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob for the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget i feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr oacute n which is at least as big as but much thicker than a cello but its design appeared amenable to some home modification that might make it work so at the price i took a chance and bought it well the back of my guitarr oacute n bulges out like a blowfish so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended my guitarr oacute n s body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks like they were made for that no modifications needed not even bending some reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over but i suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs completely open and therefore extended to its widest base if you don t really look closely as you open the legs you ll think you ve reached the stop before the legs are fully open i didn t have it fully open at first and it was a just a bit too easy to push over in my view but still acceptable when i discovered that i still had to open all three legs a bit more i retried it and it was much more steady that last mm of movement on each leg was worth improvement the stand is fully as steady as i had hoped it possibly could be especially given the price amazing anyway i gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all i even like the way it appears to physically clamp down my guitarr oacute n since it seemed to discourage itchy fingers from trying to pick it up while i was on break great picks they are shorter for speed and maneuvering sweeps better not to stumble in strings when sweep so for me it works fine i do use th turtle purple big ext hh as well but i like to try this for experiment to see how it helps spleen on sweeps etc nice picks well made i bought a second pair of these all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price good stuff this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price one does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesn t know which in or output is actually making the interference but once you ve established that it s all good baby my frist guitar strap i like it alot dose not cut in your shoulder or back will get aother one for nd guitar
277	it works for what it is it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up not a bad product just don t know how long it will last i ve used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count it s hard to find a tough low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere but this one is the best one out there for the price paid its made well with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that i love i use it for all of my equipment connections and it simply works with no problems and no noise that i could detect try it out you ll discover the same as me and my band mate s have that this is the best cable for the money on amazon i have been using those webbed nylon sometimes cutting straps for years cause they were inexpensive but not cheap don t know why i waited so long quality in this baby comfortable too this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely the screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn t have to carry so many parts nope doesn t fit a squire affinity just fyi i chose this rating because even though it is an epiphone a les paul and affiliation with gibson it is made in china not the usa as one would think by the name affiliations i think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is not a usa product when opened the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but i did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory so someone messed up in quality control with that said i find the finished look is fine without the guard the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified i decided not to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it
278	these are good quality strings that will last on your guitar for many months to come probably my second favorite after ernie ball bought these for my squire strat i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips these nobs fit great and look great i would difenantly recomend them these and the extra lights are great strings they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had now i m stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings they play great have nice action and tone i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well i like s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the power slinky name this is a great music stand very sturdy very well built just wish it came with a bag then it could be put in the guitar case but ill find one thanks it is sturdy well made feels hefty in your hands with an extremely smooth action everything the shubb winder is not well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa but what is the point if it is so much inferior i think it proves that it is not about where it is made but how it is designed and manufactured
279	d addario guitar strings are favourite strings they last a little longer and always sound good on my ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars i usually buy them for and recommend them to others also you can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often you will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned i was in a local music store the other day and noticed a huge stack of these cymbals with a few examples mounted on stands to try while they re not as rich as zildjians or paistes or other more expensive cymbals they do have that trashy sound that you look for in a china and at the asking price who can resist i ve almost exclusively used earnie balls and d addarios since i was a kid and have always been satisfied i ve taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately the d addarios are excellent strings and this price on the pack was unbeaten anywhere i have an epiphone dot and i installed a bigsby v on it i could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price and a previous reviewer said his dot with bigsby fits well it fits but just barely the guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case i have to turn the arm of the bigsby around facing down to close the case i think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position i probably wouldn t store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz i d worry about tension on the strings otherwise i like it no lie these are the perfect strings for an electric arch top smooth but not dull sounding will defiantly be buying more maybe it s because i cut my musical teeth on motown and s rock but i ve always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound or even ground wound strings it might also have something to do with the fact i play upright as well flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright like to my ears it doesn t hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever too i use d daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as i ve found them to be very consistent from set to set and the sealed plastic packaging means that i can buy a set today put it in my case and it s be as good as new a year later i used to use labella flats on my fretless and then switched to thomastik jazz flats then a friend told me he d switched from the thomastiks to these he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well i m now a convert too i bought one of these used that was just like new when i got it the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles i bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets i am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one this mic is perfect it gets the job done sounds clear has settings on it clamps on your lap top yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this trick treat your room with sound deadening strung these up on my lp goldtop with p s d addario promises these strings to be comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations that result in greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings i dunno anything regarding the science behind this but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker a and d strings compared to the regular set of d addario s they offer its not a huge huge difference but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance for one thing they re pretty stiff they bend but not easily maybe that s what they mean by balanced tension they re also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated s not flatwound mellow by any means but not quite as bright as your regular set of s i do get a great rock tone out of them mind you but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound personally i like the tone i get out of them they re big and warm without being dull sounding but again your preferences might differ one thing that s great about these strings is once they re properly stretched they stay in tune forever again maybe this is part of the balanced tension and if so good job d addario i haven t had them on forever to really see how long they last but they ve been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one who would these appeal to well if you like really light strings that bend easily you re not going to like these if you re a rythm player who does long gigs the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you i ve been recording on my imac ipod touch ipad and iphone for some time using garage band interfacing with the imac is easy using various usb devices i m currently using a usb equipped alesis preamp ios device interface is a bit more difficult it is possible to use usb preamps with an externally powered usb hub but that starts getting very complicated and messy i ve been using simple devices like the k that split the headphone microphone jack into two separate cords one for headphone and one for guitar the problem with this sort of configuration is that it s very easy to overload the microphone input and the recording quality done this way is not very good the apogee jam is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons first it contains its own dedicated preamp and a d and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity interface issues are non existent plugged into both the ipad and iphone it was immediately recognized i didn t have any problems with either of the three supplied cables the jam is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces but on the whole i think it s worth it it s simple to use has no detectable latency and delivers excellent sound quality it does seem to draw a fair amount of current and battery life is shortened significantly when using this with an iphone you ll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions with the ipad this isn t as noticeable even with that issue i think the jam is a good value the various ios devices are capable of making very high quality recordings but only with quality input given the cost of an new iphone or ipad the cost of the jam is rather trivial in comparison i ve been using d addario xl nickel wounds on my p bass for a long time they have a lot of tone they seem to last a long time and they re not very expensive these strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds but are a lot brighter you get lots of overtones and high end from these the choice of gauges is a little different from the regular xls too instead of the a and the e they have a a and a e that s just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end and more metal to dig into while retaining low tension in the d and g i m more of an old school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound but if you re into funk or more modern sounds you may feel that the bright ss sound is for you and if so these are a great string i ve been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while but i was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i ve been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller i was intrigued by the promise of long life though i have a taylor big baby that i bought used and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didn t sound at all like old strings this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new i d just changed the strings on my s gibson gospel a week ago so i decided that would be my reference the nanowebs went on my s guild d both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars the gospel is a bit brighter sounding but i m pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars if they d sounded dull i d notice as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled light gauge they had a e string something you d be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings the b was a compared to the of the d addarios i usually play the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges turns out that these are hd light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end the difference shouldn t be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d so how do they sound the unwound e and b don t sound different from any other plain steel string of course the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer when i switch between the d and the gospel sound wise i d say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day i wouldn t call them dull by any stretch of the imagination if i didn t know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn t be able to tell from playing them so they re good sounding strings and they last a long time that leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings here s the way i see it if you re a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not you re probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination but if you re a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run and if you re a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice for myself i m going to leave these on the d for as long as they still sound good i ll update this review when i find out just how long they do last follow up after playing these for a few days i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars they sound great on the loar and now i have two guitars to do a long term test on
280	i ve been buying dunlop pick for at least years now and i love the feel and the grip the picks last for a really long time and i would recommend getting several thickness for different applications but for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick i have been using dunlop picks for a long time good feel grip and not too heavy or thick good deal i haven t used this yet but it seems solid and idiot proof just like i need play coffee shops and will help if i drop my pick very good price been playing for five decades now used to tune with a tuning fork then later used a boss tu for years now the snark comes along and the boss tuner reliable and true sits in the bag with other accessories i use but it has no need to come out the snake took it s place no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in fast and easy the readout is easy to see in any light working off the vibration of the string via the guitar makes this an accurate tuner as some pickups will have too great a signal for a standard tuner and give a false reading not with the snark small handy the list goes on but i think you get the point it works well very long battery life easy to see oh and did i mention accurate yeah i think i did
281	these work great it s hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time you have a strap you have a guitar this locks them together but these do work really well compared to other brands i find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered by me to be aesthetically pleasing but this is true for most strap lock systems so i say go for it stars because i ve only used it in stereo mode and stamina mode stamina mode is supposed to run for hours perhaps it does but if so it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode no one records hours straight so i m guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner if not for that i d have rated stars in terms of clarity flat response and transparency it is excellent the auto rec level is very smooth and doesn t sound as if has been severely limited and squashed at rehearsals before the whole band kicks in the levels are quite loud but it comes down quickly and smoothly in terms of the other features i cannot comment open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
282	excellent rack screws with washers its fit very good to rack holes good presentation and well packed i will buy again haven t had this long but so far it s just about perfect i had bought another on stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness on stage my see review this one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable and only costs a few bucks more fourteen buckos at present i ve got a gooseneck and a light ish condenser mic with a shock mount on it and it s as steady as can be i m convinced even heavier loads will be no problem if you re in need of a side boom look no further excellent equipment for the price i paid can t beat what i got have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them it s been several years now and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment one of the the best lights i own small but fills a gym with light for under what more could you ask as the other reviewers boast this is a great unit and i hope it lasts a long long time the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting good enuf okay i guess but after transporting and reset i found them to be junk
283	solid stays where i put it and does a great job holding a heavy mic mount and pop filter can t really beat it for the price i just got this to run my passive pa its inexpensive and easy to use very portable and does the job it was designed to do this cable is great for xlr microphones or di boxes they are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality i needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar solid yes adjusts to right height yesit is perfect well worth every penny this on stage da drum stick holder works great and is super easy to attach looks good feels good don t know what else to write here to meet the review word count needed an xlr cable for a gig and ordered one of these the week before it got the job done my bass sounded great through the pa and the crowd loved the band home run
284	this style of capo can throw your guitar out of tune if you don t put it on right when used correctly though it does it s job just fine nice overall with a good sustained ring from the steel strings and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings i like the sound i get on my yamaha acoustic i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic string have problems with the strings first the bass e th string broke while tuning it up had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string not elixir i have changed strings many many times so i am convinced it was not my stringing but a weakness in the e string itself second the high d th string seems dead it does not ring as it should and as the other high strings do though none as much as other string sets i ve used considering these strings cost much more than others i certainly am disappointed in them hardly matters if they last longer if they don t sound as good clear amazing cable very underrated incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone i might try a lighter set next time but these have a good clear tone from low to high and are fairly comfortable i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar and will soon replace them on quality control the high e steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it two of which show after stringing the guitar string did not break as i rather expected but it looks bad on sound these seemed okay at first but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week especially the high b and e steel strings which just don t sound that good to me and i find the low e wound string notes tend to be too high as i move up the neck more so than other sets i have used guess i ll go back to d addario and ernie ball these strings sound great and so far have held tune well after a couple of days of stretching i have them on my luna string and the sound is rich i would purchase them again this amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from modelling amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five flavor settings in each they are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you ve switched gears here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you d have to be right up on them to see how they are set i ve had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned it s velcroed on there just fine the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather like material plenty loud not much to say about a basic bag it fits a dreadnaught acoustic string guitar has good padding and has a large front pouch for music and small fairly flat items like a tuner winder or spare strings has a carry handle strap but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have seems well made
285	i ve been using these for about weeks now they are strong but flexible and don t seem to develop kinks or bending habits if you roll them up the proper way i ve seen and used some better cables but not at this price point and i ve certainly seen quite a few worse this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion i bought one of these in the beginning just to have something as this is better than having nothing at all but it s certainly nothing special the material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain so i only used it for a very short time on the other hand if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of then you ll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point i upgraded to a really nice wide black leather levy s guitar strap which is five stars all the way if you re a newbie and don t have a strap and are on a tight budget and need something then this planet waves strap will probably work for you till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear just my cents great for a beginner electric needed new strings but everything else was smooth pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well for my first gig bag its ok i since then bought a new alvarez acoustic electric which i will be buying a hard case simply because the build quality and protection isnt there in a padded case i have had this padded bag for a year now with light use and edges are starting to tare and rip also i am concerned that the zippers might get stuck and break at any moment i will be replacing this with a hard cases as soon as i buy one for my alvarez
286	easy to usegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much this tool has high marks for one reason it works this is the best at combining two tools into one give it high marks for form and function love it after going to various guitar music stores and trying out many guitars yamaha ibanez fender and others i researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make model and saw the many positive reviews it had i was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first so i purchased the best sounding guitar locally costing me after day i realized i was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online the many reviews were absolutely correct this guitar is wonderful and sounds great i replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the light strings i bought even though it is only an guitar i will treasure this one as if it was perfect intonation all the way up to the octave low action and stays in tune for days i ll be honest the reason i got these strings is because of the cheap price i m a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only these seem fine to me good tone and they stay in tune it s really hard to beat this product for the price i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar i really appreciate the low wide stance which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself guitar bag fit over my fender t bucket guitar cheap price and does the job it has just enough padding and heavy duty nylon to protect my acoustic from being scratched worth this is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that s been around it s better because it cleans all at once
287	this is good cable excellent plugs the lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material which will hold everything in place for years grade a cable at a very affordable price definitely going back for more the ft cable was only a couple dollars more than ft these strings sound really great and have that special nanoweb coating that is resistant to corrosion and rusting like other strings tend to get as they age the extra light gauge sound so bright and happy on my acoustic which is very old and tired looking but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it very much recommended acoustic and elixir electric strings as well i ve been playing for years and i own electric guitars all of my guitars are strung with d addario s they sound great when they re fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest i play at least hours per week so i put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings it s really the durability that sets these apart the amazon price is terrific i like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and i can buy a year s worth of these for the same price as set of bass strings i d definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through amazon this same chord was almost bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you won t trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today this is a great sounding reverb pedal tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound i ve combined this with a epiphone sheraton ii semi hollow body and have been able to get some awesome deep rich sounds watch out for feedback though the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use honestly i think it has a lot of reverb settings that i won t use very much but there s no problem with them being there i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u etc or if you re just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones this is it this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar my only caveat to this review is that i haven t tried out other reverb pedals but this one definitely suits all my needs as soon as i got this pedal i put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum i have a behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals but my pedal board was silent till i put this pedal on it i ve only had it for a few days but the cons out way the pros maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit once i get around to playing with it i will write another review i only have two pedals but that was one outlet spot too many and it really makes a difference when you re onstage with only one power strip now i just wish i had an attachment that would let me charge my laptop and iphone from the same plug as the pedals can t always get what you want the most annoying thing about modern ideas in ukulele strings or indeed in guitar strings is to wind them with aluminum wire making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands or at worst cognitive damage skin contact with them these rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound but are silver plate wound no health problems possible from strings makes them the best they have good ends they do feel a little flimsy on the cord side of things they have good signal though and don t seem to alter the tone i have them all on my pedalboard now so time will tell if they hold up or not my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand it comes with a cord that has a standard inch end i plugged it into a small guitar amp they use it mainly to sing along with their cds mp s note that this is not really a mic i would use in my studio it is more of a toy to be honest but a quality toy for a young child in that regard i give it five stars these stay connected but aren t so wide that they change the style of picking i like them and so does my music teacher we try to stay stocked in these picks title says it all i guess it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness that i m not crazy about in dunlops and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands bought these months ago and i ve got to say they re very durable too certainly more so than the small pick alternatives i tried i m happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for good deal i ve been playing with my brother s lunchbox and when he first plugged in for a jam at his house i thought he was joking this amp can easily cut through drums even in the close confines of his practice studio granted i am not a heavy hitter but we were messing around with come classic rock from the early s and this amp at three on the volume knob was plenty loud the tone is very good but not exceptional it s not as clean as a fender or jazz chorus but it s still better than many of the amps i ve listened to if you want to make this a spectacular tome machine plug aboss fbm fender bassman pedalinto it about the quirks the ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb it does give a hall like sound as you increase it but was designed to simulate an open back amp more than a true effect the gain controls the input signal to the amp and according to the manual is more like a soft overdrive the volume level is solely controlled with the volume knob with the gain knob playing no real role in how loud the amp gets finally the speaker switch on the rear is for turning the internal speaker on and off not the speaker out circuit for routing the signal to an external cab that means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the inch internal speaker off or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal one plugging phones into the headphone jack will not turn off the internal speaker you need to do that with the speaker switch personally i love that feature because you can also use the phones jack as an output to a pa with the amp s internal speaker still active you definitely need to follow the instruction manual and especially the advanced user s guide or you may be initially disappointed my brother returned the first unit he purchased because there was a pop when it was turned on or off as well as a slight hum when it was idling the replacement amp exhibited the same problems however if you follow the manuals plural you can prevent both problems i mentioned quirks the power on and off procedure and positioning the gain knob to the mid level are the keys to smoothing the amp out bottom line this tiny amp packs a punch and has sound characteristics that have to be heard to believe if you want true reverb you will need to plug in a pedal check out theboss frv fender reverb pedalif you haven t already but for small venues and practice rooms the ambiance feature is probably all you need do take the time to read the documentation before you start using it because when this amp is properly used it s simply amazing if you are a beginning guitarist like myself you probably can t tell one note from another this product does all the hard work for you easily quickly and accurately the only thing i needed to know but didn t was that if you get a reading of g and you need to make the reading b for the b string the notes follow the alphabet from a to g and then begin again so you are turning in the right direction from g if the next note is a the one after a will be b seems simple enough if you know anything about music i didn t the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck it s just as good as any i love the joyo pedals affordable and doesn t break the bank great feel to them and nice sounding they do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what i normally use i think i will try these in the super slinky i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop it has two brightness settings illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly ns ned steinburger capo is different than your traditional kyser style capo i really like how it is designed where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos i have used it boasts minimal string bending across the frets where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck i tried this out and sure enough their claim was true i capo ed from the st fret up to the th where i would actually never use it and tuning stayed pretty much accurate there is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in just in case you drop the one in your hand overall this is a great product and i give it a high recommendation and five stars the flashback x is an awesome sounding and flexible delay pedal i got this through a third party seller on amazon for under new a steal in my opinion having three settings is awesome since i will use them all in a set having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly the toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website it s simple to use my galaxy to beam the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups very cool technology makes me feel like i m on a guitar version of star trek i can t say that i have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great i am partial to the with modulation very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus the space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background which coincides with the delay time sounds great with a little overdrive added in all in all this is a great pedal and a purchase that i am totally happy with it is by far the best delay pedal i have ever owned as well as being the most versatile five stars from me i ve been using slinky regular nickels for over years on my electrics and love them i ve tried various coated strings etc but always come back to ernie for sound and value but on my acoustics it s been d addario j s since day one and still is never had one bad set out of over a hundred i adore the sound and the reliability so why have i never tried their e git strings because the slinkys are perfect but i must say so are these i just put a set of s on one of my strats and they are as snappy yet not too bright as i could want they really complement the single coil tones especially the and out of phase positions so if you re a strat fan and love that tone give these a shot one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact no idea why but if you have huge posts and like mega wraps here s your puppy i only do a triple wrap max so it s just more to cut but hardly an issue and no matter what the coated string fans say those might stay clean longer but that brand new string zing only lasts a few hours on any string coated or not so if you re recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones or playing big gigs where tone is everything i say stick with uncoated strings and aside from slinkys these are the best i ve played the tascam dp ex is great i love this little box it s got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop here are a few of the features that i really like about it it s portable and runs on aa batteries it has compression exciter de esser as well as eq and reverb it has a mastering section with effects you can record tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks it feels sturdy not that i would drop it just to name a few i compared this against the fostex mr mkii which i also own and like the tascam has more features for the buck as well it should as it just came out this year and the fostex has been around a while as another reviewer put it this won t replace your daw i can record some very polished songs on my laptop but the tascam does come close the mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too i have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience the portability factor is huge in my opinion being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs or vice versa is great plus it s fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas i totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section five stars i am a fan of planet waves ns capos but this new one is not very well designed the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards i find my left hand hitting the lever when i m in open position frustrating it does have a pick holder which can be handy and a place to put an ns tuner which can also be handy i just think it could have been better designed i don t particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff i ll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser starsmy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality the a d is often weak and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi tracking apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy the a d is quite smooth and it transfers the signal near perfectly and little it is not much bigger than the jack if bon scott only knew but small though it may be there s plenty of signal processing power in there and while it doesn t stand up my best outboard gear it offers very clean clear sound transfers from guitar bass keys and line mics so that you can do good sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the jam as interface which is yet another step forward in high quality home recordings i like the thought that we re getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites and not paying crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this jam and maybe soon enough we ll see artists keeping all of the profits from their art imagine that this offers very close to studio quality but keep in mind that even with bit it is solid state once you ve used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make i ran this through one of mine and the a b made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place speaking of crapple the ads for this suggest that it is for istuff only which is not true i ran it on ultimate and it worked a charm so don t be fooled by the typically proprietary ads which cook and co probably insist on don t mention anybody but us offer no alternatives they must stay in our universe well you needn t this works with almost anything so don t be fooled by the ad copy the only negative i can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build making one wonder how good the internals are and how long they ll hold up a stronger more solid sleeve would have been nice especially at the price of but it does sound good though as it may be used for portable purposes you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks don t mess with it take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music true to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound you still get finger noise as you slide your fingers when setting up for the next chord but the noise is somewhat less i have used other elixir nonweb coated strings and these strings are in par with them i can t speak to the string life the boast of these strings is that will last to times longer and if that is the case i will run out of time to submit my feedback so far now they sound great feel great and if they don t last as long as the other elixirs you ll still come out ahead since they shouldn t cost any more
288	compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board the quality is good i like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again very handy for making it all just right i will buy these again for sure this cable seems top notch to me some complaints i heard had to do with this brand not lasting of course those guys abuse their equipment maybe that will be something i ll encounter but this cable appears to be very well made and it works great i take very good care of my gear so i expect this one to last only gave it four out of five because i d rate some other cables slightly higher this a great cable the length is perfect for practice and i d buy another this cable expands the capability of the one spot or godlyke v adapter the quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards i bought this cable in an emergency situation one where i was on the road needed a great cable and didn t have access to roll my own using what would ve been essentially the same parts i exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio and in critical places of my live setup the cable itself is top shelf quiet and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect as an instrument cable this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch making it worth it to go for the cable as a bass or guitar player if you don t like being tied down i used this as part of a keyboard rig where it was perfect on all levels quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum the highs were crystal the bass clear connection is solid i am not a gold fanatic but these are excellent great warranty and a reputation that holds value these are real deal pro cables as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price but not necessarily a superior build or sound which is why i didn t walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster s and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead
289	did not hold the strings down very well for me i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power i live in a dry climate and i have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily since i can t afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing i get anywhere from to weeks out of a pack the time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price on the refillable humidifiers you really can t forget more than a day or two to replenish the water with the humidpak you have a lot more security going on a trip you won t have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case i ve owned many tuners through the years and i keep coming back to this one buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point i have other capos and decided to try this one and i have to say i love it i have used the kyser spelling for years as my favorite and that is a good capo but i will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz i will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up but i love it so far i use it on my taylor ce taylor e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
290	well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning am i impressed u bet cha this thing is simply beautiful it arrived well padded in a double box initially i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws none not a finger print on it anywhere this guitar is extremely well made and put together right it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter the neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities i put a quarter under the th fret and it s right on the money it s considerably heaver than than i thought i would imagine it weighs about lbs i have a strap ordered and on the way the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had your hand floats over the frets i don t think you could get a better piece for the price point great highs and lows but rough on the fingertips and difficult doing barre chords slides and single string progressions ok with more effort i really like this strap i ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so i can have one on each guitar they re really comfortable they re much less bulky than most of the leather straps i ve seen so i can just keep them on the guitar in the case i ve had the original blue one i bought for about years and it still looks and functions like new takes you hours to play around with all the sounds built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage nice and loud in a small package
291	i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin i was surprised at the good quality for such a little price it does exactly what i needed it for it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments it works better than my piano i can trust that i will be in tune it works well with several different instruments that i have makes tuning a lot easier and accurate it is a good value this is a pretty good non expensive capo you can spend more but this does what you need it to do
292	this is the best case ever for the money i have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the gator deluxe i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week these picks work well and look as pictured the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture i would recommend them sure it s a few bucks more than the standard crybaby but totally worth it built like a tank but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings idk why gc does not carry these annoying great pick worth buying a baggie if you like the ultex feel but hate the in store larger only ones get these this product is worth having if like me you find yourself needing a place to quickly park your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand i use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand works great only suggestion i have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside or a way of semi permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn t move around i wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed overall i like it
293	love these picks have used them for years feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever highly recommend im a huge fan of elixir s this however is my first go with the polyweb but there is no disappointment here a solid favorite around my house fat and deep snappy when needed you can definitly pay more and you may want a more specific tone but these are a safe bet that always sound good all three of my kids have a guitar they were always losing their picks this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks these do really well i only wish i d ordered the light s i usually buy the elizir but i thought i d give these a try i m sorry martin but i like the elixer s the best just my opinion
294	i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar got tired of losing picks in mid jam digging through pockets scavenging for another pick now it s right there in particular i favor the dual design why if the need arises it s possible to use a regular strap that doesn t have the button locks installed i have two of the black ones on a string ibanez rg and laguna le qbc guitars i have spare straps for both guitars and sometimes i lock those spares with the plastic dunlop discs i have some older bass guitars with similar dunlop locks the standard version two of which had locks installed in the mid s and one from with the gold dd all three of them have held up with no issues i didn t need to re tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago then again i don t tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as metallica i usually keep pick in my mouth when i don t use them but sometimes i drop them and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it so this is a nice option to have a spare one if you use bass picks get this it is bigger than the guitar version much like the picks i actually use these on my bass if my fingers are too worn from heavy playing they have the same sound as a finger on a string it is actually a really neat thing to have in my bag i recomend trying one out some time
295	if you want to do swells with your instrument or make notes cry this will do the trick smooth reliable action and no noise too compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board the quality is good i like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again very handy for making it all just right i will buy these again for sure i needed a footswitch for a variety of applications to include an acoustic amp guitar amps and other guitar audio gear built like a tank and completely configurable well done again roland bottom line up front if you play an orange vox or marshall you don t necessarily need an eq pedal but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level why is this well the brits design their amps with wide and musical eq but the overall frequency response is narrow this has led many british amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that british eq isn t as dramatic as american guitarists want it to be there is nothing wrong with this by any means it s just an overall characteristic of british amplifiers secondly any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost db seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty or dirty to overdrive or overdrive to distortion live performance if you re in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs you ve probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass midrange noise hz that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter applying eq to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low end from the picture and boosting your high end for better clarity recording direct in if you re using this pedal with a di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping you ll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your strat or brighten your les paul why stars yes the noise it s not bothersome by any means but if you re recording with a mic d amp or direct in you will absolutely need a noise suppressor i use my ge with the boss ns and the ns completely removes the white noise generated from the ge the result is an amazing clean boosting eq if you re on the fence go ahead and get this thing you won t regret it it s not just for tone snobs it can really make cheap gear sound way better and take great gear to the next level i love the sound of this pedal it s as versatile as can be if you want to sound like dimebag darrels then don t buy this pedal if you want a nice drive that is responsive this is for you i employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortions overdrives i have noticed the on off light is intermittent but the pedal still effects the signal either way for a pedal that i have stomped on so many times i m not even the least bit concerned for an inexpensive unit this thing rules
296	all joking aside these heads really are great tune em right and you ll get a nice warm tone from them that s unmatched with other brands this is an excellent product i ve used one of these before and don t remember it having lock washers this does when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened for you cannot go wrong with this bear in mind that it s for a standard hole diatonic harmonica not the hole chromatic style none of the problems on off that plague the cry baby better sound too people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix but this is the original and the best obligatory i don t use it for any heavy use i use it for podcasting purposes haven t had any problems so i can t speak to really heavy use of the product these wires definatly change the sound of the snare drasticly improving sound as well as looks very satisfied with my purchase i bought a second pair of these all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price good stuff i ll be brief and to the point here works as an audio interface for a line level signal i used this with my samson mixer is compact and the usb cable itself is long enough the red color looks nice has a headphone out with volume control plug and play no extra drivers needed i use asio anyways cheap there s no audio interface this affordable latency fairly low not bad plastic body rca connectors not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono inch khz and bit sampling should have been bit and maybe khz even my digitech rp has a built in bit audio interface
297	i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price after trying to use it i promptly returned it i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer i tried recording on the h using it s line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h was very distorted i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean good quality sound the problem with my h was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp recording from the internal mics seems to work fine i have worked with professional sound equipment for over years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem the h has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings look for something else i exchanged this model for an h n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal but not as bad as the h i finally ended up getting the tascam dr which i am very happy with it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder i bought one of these used that was just like new when i got it the craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele the build quality the aquila strings and the tuning keys are very high quality you can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time i downloaded a lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way it is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles i bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets i am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one i purchased the h n after being unhappy with the h s performance most significant where i couldn t record a good sounding signal that wasn t distorted with the line in jack only to find that the h n has the same problem but not as bad if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h n s inch jacks it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp adjusting the gain doesn t correct it i contacted zoom s tech support about the h and was told that i likely had a defective unit i returned the h and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h n after seeing many positive reviews i really like the h n s design the menus and controls are nicely organized it feels more sturdy than the h the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent most other recorders in this price range don t have xlr inputs since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board if the line in jacks don t work properly and can t accept a normal line level signal without clipping i can t use this for what i bought it for i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past years and have never had any problems i ve worked with pro sound equipment for over years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem if you are using this to record with mics it works great but if you need to record from line level sources the zoom recorders may not be a good choice i exchanged this for the tascam dr and while the tascam doesn t have as many bells and whistles it is a nice recorder and i m very happy with it this is a very versatile tuner i use it all the time to check my instruments and keep things sounding good highly recommend this product
298	super low capacitance on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from mogami canare etc the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves super handy elastic cord wrap these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price i used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors but with these i don t see the point the lifetime exchange warranty also makes the diy repair thing kind of pointless too of course amazon s return policy is still days so be aware of that you d need to mail it back to the mfr or take it to another dealer to exchange that is if you ever had to no problems with this fits my behringer dollar condenser mike just fine like it was made from the same company but it s not they must have standard fittings on mikes this is an excellent choice if you re looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint it looks great it s easy to use and it s a fantastic size for a delay pedal the analog delay is nice and warm much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays there is a internal adjustment that i don t think i will need to use for now anyway i highly recommend it i m so glad ernie ball decided to put out this tool i ve been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill the reason i never did was that i was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose this is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners i love it loved this mic when i hooked it up it sounds great and for the price you can t go wrong wish that it had a on off switch but you can get around that great for instruments and vocals as well was delivered on time as well amazon is the best and have the best vendor tc just does things right i love how easy this is to use the incredible clarity of sound and minutes of recording time i do a single duo and full band it goes with me to all gigs and i do use it for when i am practicing highly recommended solution
299	i had fairly low expectation for a pedal but many people said it sounded very close if not better than a vintage boss vb considering i didn t want to spend x this pedal i can t compare the but can say it works very well it can do subtle low rate low depth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles the rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control or at least turning it up weakens the effect which i guess is good i might swap around the leads finally a non blue led is used which means it won t blind you when you try to adjust the settings being however the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even behringer s pedal and the hinge is a little less stable it will still hold up with moderate use however it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature which is a momentary mode i had the behringer dr ultra reverb but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds although this unit is only more the difference in sound and tone may as well be difference in quality of sound that is this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences it may not have every reverb sound but it has a nice selection and they cover an impressive range as well as giving you the option of wet full or dry tinny sounds and a trails that essentially adds some sustain there s also an echo setting but it s not very pronounced though it does add an echo like sound so my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualities there are a couple of annoying inconveniences one is the bright blue light indicating on this has been commented on before i have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined when it s on you can t read the dials because of the glare in your eyes i did find a solution i put dark nail polish over the led bulb i had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming i desired the second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting of course you can remember where it is or which one it is but my other behringer pedals all have white lettering making them much easier to read every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps my solution to this little dilemma was to buy some white vinyl letters from office depot and put them over the words reverb on the pedal it was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes but now i m much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations this pedal is amazing it has so many functions unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic i love this pedal and i would completely recommend it i first installed one of these in a new laminated guitar to test it and i was truly blown away by the quality of the sound i had purchased this guitar for practicing during our cold and dry new england winter the sound was so good that i ended up putting another one into my prized guild madeira built in japan this guitar sounds much better than the laminated fender does and this pickup reproduces it accurately through my fender amplifier s clean setting i tried attaching the pickups in various positions but found that i liked the sound the best when the pickup was attached slightly below towards the bottom of the guitar and slightly favoring the treble strings side of the bridge just off center in the lower x bracing youtube has several good installation videos that show you exactly how to install an acoustic pickup such as this one i ve used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces it s wonderful no longer having to keep the guitar perfectly still with relations to an external stand mounted microphone if you wish to record your acoustic guitar this is an effective and very inexpensive solution for that i don t know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all mighty vintage tube screamers of ibanez but it is an exact clone including the same component values potentiometers ics jrc etc for proof that it is exactly the same i was able to modify it for different frequency response corner frequency and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in ts mods of course the board is layed out a little differently the only reason i gave it really stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise hiss at higher gains but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter this gives it the characteristic mid range boost it can be cut with the tone control but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier and or a one spot power adapter i ve used this to connect several devices and the colors help i would recommend this and the quality is good for the price this lil guy does the job i got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables the pedal is somewhat cheaply made the jacks don t really seem to fit the housing so well but i do have it somewhat semi permanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue
300	these came on my american tele in and i ve been buying them ever since sweet action durable and very affordable for something but not a guitar wasn t sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook or notepad computer so i can follow a recipe it seems to work okay for that just don t use this for guitars an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far and the arms have no grip this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project it may even give you aids but probably not however animals could have been harmed in the making but most likely and in reality it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well manufacturer s website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar i have an esp eclipse not even close chromacast products are great they need to fix the info on their web page i m not a fan of shaped les paul cases too bad
301	i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well i like s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the power slinky name its cheap it worx what more to say welp only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it d be perfect nope i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt dblow on bruthas n sistas doc p i use this footer between my guitar pedals and amp i do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new i was initially concerned when i first received the cable that it would not last the cable is not as fat as i had hoped however the ends are solid and sturdily built i usually use mogami gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so if that long this hosa cable is a very good cable and i even chose to use hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals they last i love this little guy clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you it will still accurately tune the guitar very easy and simple to use i paid for it and it is times better than the one i have small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin it works well for all of them and is inexpensive it seems redundant to review again except to point out i have bought more and will buy more i will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it s case i have given out and kept i have working guitars i need more snarks some have had their batteries run down in under a year but i get close to years off a new battery batteries are a bit costly
302	i hesitate to write this review simply because it s pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings to be honest i was very very impressed with their feel and handling i do think they re the best playing strings i ve used when it comes to pure playability hands down none better they were butter smooth and great for flat picking but for me it was a trade off because i simply wasn t impressed with the tone i even took the time to try them on three different guitars all dreadnoughts a classic maple sides spruce top a mahogany back sides with spruce top and a maple backs sides with a nato top on all three i didn t like the tone as much as the strings i was using i really wanted to like them but they simply didn t have the tone of the medium gauge martin sps i normally use this isn t to say they re not great strings that sound different on other peoples guitars but i simply didn t like them on mine i love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music i play in our jam group the elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the martin strings i use and the treble sounds tinny vs the clear ring of the martins i normally use to be fair the bass strings sound great and aren t much different i would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you re going to use them i play in acoustic groups and the elixir strings just don t have what i need to be heard in spite of how great they feel under your fingers if playability is more important than great tonal range then by all means buy these strings you won t be disappointed i m guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones some say daw dare e o de ah dare e o dad ar ee oh or dee ah dare e o others shorten it to d adds or even daddy o s took me a while to figure that last one out i was trying to find out info about daddy o strings and why people thought they were so great duh while people may disagree on how to say the name few debate the idea that these are great strings less expensive that most string sets out there especially if you buy multi packs color coded to make string changes easy easy to find from most any vendor or music store made in the usa you can collect players points for swag they are sealed in a special environmentally friendly package to keep them fresh and corrosion free they have one of the widest range of string size combinations availableif you are just starting out and do not know what to put on your new guitar then the phrase set it up with exl s or put on some da dairy o nines is a good choice at least for a strat or tele like guitar i personally like them better than ernie ball super slinkys aka eb pinks but i cannot quite put my finger on why you can pay more for coated strings cryogenic frozen strings boutique strings and all that but if you do not know what any of those are then you probably haven t been playing long enough to find value in them almost every guitarist has a set of strings they swear by because they work wonders that no other string can they make them play smoother or faster their last set of strings lasted for years or whatever i just appreciate a great value and d addario strings are just that btw for the record the official pronunciation is da dairy o we receive letters each week regarding the correct pronunciation of the d addario name some years back we even ran an ad that illustrated an easy way to pronounce the d addario name the name is pronounced phonetically as follows da dairy o a simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories based upon some of the other reviews i feel i got a different product as it didn t fit the descriptions given by others i ordered two of these and both were very thin material not sturdy at all second both straps were not adjustable to both mine measured from strap button hole to strap button hole fully extended they are useless to me as my guitar a dreadnought covers the middle of my chest when i put it on i believe i was given a substitute product since when i ordered these straps the price was just and now they re back up to as i write this i m really sick of these amazon substitutions for what i paid i won t bother returning them not worth the hassle i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars very disappointed warning if you see a price drop below don t buy it s probably not the product that s described here always looking for that elusive perfect capo light yet strong and dependably firm you just found it this is an exemplary capo no surprise as it s designed by ned steinberger who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics it s made of serious aluminum and the spring is super solid the tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it won t come off again until you loosen it no slippage here this also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it s even less in the way of your hand a very useful feature which most other one hand capos can t offer it s an easy on in seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets the rubber is well bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least unlike many cheap capos it sits well on any six string though is not flat enough for a classical but most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric unless you re albert collins who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here so this will cover all your basic capo needs it s got a little slot for the d addario brand tuner but i use a snark and these two go together well put on the capo activate the tuner on the headstock tune it up and away you go perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo if you ve ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo this is a godsend combo the capo also has a little pick slot which will comfortably take up to about a mm pick it fits picks perfectly by the way this ns artist capo is well worth bucks and since i got it my shubb and kysers have sat lonely in the corner if you haven t ever experimented with capos try them out they can really change the way you play your guitar and may help you find you sing better than you think as we all have our best keys and a capo can help you find yours i love playing bluegrass licks in g while capoed at the second fret for instance the extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it s almost like another instrument this goes for every fret pretty much up to about the sixth where it gets a little cramped all in all this is the best capo i ve ever used especially for this quality at this price i have reviewed these strings before and frankly i wasn t all that impressed with the tone the first time around i think they feel great on the fingertips and they re very playable especially for a picker but i just wasn t sold on the tone to be fair i only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars and found them lacking there seemed to be a drop ff in tone when switching from my usual strings martin sps to these so this time i decided to try them on a much smaller guitar i have a yairi alvarez ay which is a sized guitar and they sound terrific i m no engineer or physicist so i really can t explain the mechanics of it all but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body and they produce a very clear bright tone across the higher range and hold their own on the low range i still don t think they re the best thing since sliced bread and i still think they re a bit overpriced but i have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than i would expect this seems to have no effect on the tone but for what these cost you d think the coating would last a lot longer than two months i play daily for at least minutes a day overall these are good but overpriced strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars you ll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them and which don t in my experience large body guitars lose tone but they sound great on a smaller body i have lots of friends who play these strings some love them more than any other string and some are like me they re clearly good strings and i love the way they play and feel on my fingertips but i can t get past the sound it could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars but in any case i m not happy with the sound and that s why i have a hard time giving them a solid five star rating i tried these on two separate guitars i play regularly and wasn t terribly impressed with the sound on either one is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone and is crisp clear and fairly loud these strings softened the tone which i wasn t looking to do they sound okay but nowhere near as good as the martin sps i use to really bring out the best in that guitar i also have a cutaway electric acoustic i use to sing with because it s fairly quiet and the softer tones don t drown out my voice these strings made the guitar even more quiet and there was a considerable drop off in tone quality as well they might have been cheap old strings because i couldn t tell that there was anything special about them this particular guitar didn t have spectacular sound to begin with and these strings did nothing to improve it i like strings to either sound as good as other strings or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar these strings did neither for me however they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp based upon my experimentation i would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and you re not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality you ll love the way these strings feel and play i rate them excellent in that category but for me tone is of the equation i d play wire wrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings in the tonal category these strings fell short on a guitar with excellent tone i noticed a distinct drop in tone quality and on another softer more muted guitar tone quality vanished in the final analysis if you re a picker and your guitar can be plugged in you ll love these strings if you re really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesn t have stellar tone to begin with you might gain some playability but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality
303	it s a lot smaller than the picture makes it look but that s a good thing it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock light weight compact and all in one tool what more could i ask for this tool does three things very well turns tuners on stringed instruments quickly cuts musical instrument strings and helps pull acoustic guitar string pins what s not to like well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open guess i m used to side cutters or pliers and it doesn t cut strings really close to the tuning pin it leaves about a half inch of string hanging oh if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar go to the elixir strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the taylor guitar factory your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners the alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more i find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings somebody could manage to break this plastic tool the tool is made of sturdy plastic if abused trying to cut copper wire it might break but the tool was never designed for that use i ve used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time i use this on three different guitars an acoustic and two electrics les paul and prs the pin puller works just fine i actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood the tool fits inside my hard shell gibson guitar case this is a very nice tool this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians i bought this boost to use in one specific situation when playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down my volume drops quite dramatically this boost does what it says it will do to remedy that but it also seems to add a lot of noise when the boost is off my super high gain fryette deliverance is very quiet when i just hold my hand over the strings i m using a lp custom with a stock r pick up in the neck and t in the bridge when i turn on the boost i immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise when playing it isn t so bad but i definitely am not used to so much extra noise there are a couple of adjustment switches inside and i haven t fooled with those yet but i m definitely going to do that this boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound but if you ve already got pro quality stuff i don t see too much of an advantage here i like the pedal it s totally silent very bright display sensitive meter in fact the only complaint i have is that the strum every string at once thing isn t as useful as you might think not that i ever use it i d buy this product again if i had it to do over again
304	you are looking at what i consider to be the best friend a voice ever had during a year broadcast and voiceover career i have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the shure sm b and it s predecessors the sm and sm large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi track studio work i ve used over the years the sennheiser md ev re ev re n d shure sm b shure sm shure sm and most recently tried a heil pr sometimes this was not of my own selection but i just used what was available of the lot the shure sm b is my favorite of the ones still available the sm b is a better shielded sm and the sm b of today has a better shock mount than the old sm or earlier sm b the shielding in the b model minimizes rfi from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc the sm was a redesign of the sm i consider the sm to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn t been in production in ages i have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the rca dx and rca but they were not as good as the sm or sm or sm b today s sm b is the best non condenser vocal microphone still in production stop looking and buy one you will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the ev s i can play a sm b like a violin the others i just don t seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an sm b while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn t dj s change jobs a lot and i got tired of finding the ev re re n d mics or the sennheiser everywhere i went so i bought my own sm b i never liked the ev s or sennheiser much and didn t ever feel like they were much of a tool the heil pr is pretty good but doesn t have any on board eq options for recording not having the eq is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can t do much of that the sm b is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an re n d but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the sm b is only dynamic large diaphragm mic i know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work the others are more versatile but the sm b is the voice microphone and that was all it was intended to be it has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphone of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably that is one reason vocals sound good on a tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multi frequency overtones of the human voice unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn t intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise if you are doing a dry voiceover you can t hide the hiss of a condenser under something else with the sm b you don t have to even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves recording engineers today are usually totally ignorant about they figure anything short of a multi thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong if you want a good all around microphone this is not it if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is as others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear i ve ever connected to it i think if you have some cheap usb interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers most real studio preamps are a good match for it i ve plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too you need at least db of gain the spec sheet actually says db would be better lots is made of the low output of db but it isn t all that much less than the shure sm which is db db isn t much at all for any decent mic preamp but again most of the one box solution usb interfaces with built in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind the shure sm b comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra they all need an external windscreen but only the sm b comes with one i got mine years ago when it still came with two windscreens it has a nice metal case for storage travel i think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one shure calls the a ws but still come in the metal case i use the smaller windscreen mostly and shure calls them the rk and their distributors still carry them the smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and i d suggest getting one of the rk s but that is the only accessory you ll need to add the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged they are also very durable for foam screens on the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple eq adjustments for flat bass rolloff presence boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best you can just leave the plate off if you want this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic so i m just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work i should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new heil pr first to make sure i was still an sm b guy and it took a while for the heil tryout to happen since i didn t want to actually buy one i still am an sm b guy i would give it stars but it won t let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class i rounded it up to stars but the sm was actually a bit closer to a star vocal mic this is a great quality microphone and at a good price keep it mind it is xlr for those that haven t noticed xlr is a better quality than other connections it s the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone looking for a good comparison and is much better quality it s flawless in quality and doesn t give any feedback i would recomment for anyone especially having such a great price
305	when i bought this i didn t think it was going to be as good as it is it seemed a little plastic ie from the photos so i didn t think it was going to hold up very well it actually really surpassed my expectations however the winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiple sized tuners it was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well the wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem for dollars it s a really good deal this is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as i do i ve tried other types including those that i made myself but i much prefer this one i find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars from fender takamine ovations etc for the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling highly recommended this is a good product its not the best strap but for what i paid for it its well worth it ive had it for about a month and so far it seems to be holding up very well this is a great product for a beginer who doesn t love these tuners easy to use easy to read and has options that i don t even use highly recommend this i bought the wrong pack was supposed to buy the light medium pack but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best my favorite pick out of this bunch was the dunlop jazz pick it would be great if the item name was changed to like dunlop med heavy pick variety pack but that might be me being too picky came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box
306	made of quality material i do not need anything fancy because i am a simle person it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy packs of these hunks of crap for under bucks i should have spent the extra bucks and got the pack of ernies i didn t even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right never again these strings are great they last for a real long time they even include free picks which is so cool i defiantly recommend them for everybody else they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back i have the fender mustang iv and i would say the fender is a superior modeling amp but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get the bass sounds great and when i played here comes the sun on my acoustic i d swear the tone sounded like the beatles record the modeling sound is ok and they tell me there s a looper here but i d have to pay an extra for a pedal to access it oops there goes a star for the con job peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less i ll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future
307	not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings hope that helps thank you i was impressed by the quality of this product it is simple and does its job well easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or les paul or with a thin neck on most metal guitars holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise was a great value i lose picks constantly years ago i resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when im not playing it that of course leads to bent picks and still lost picks this thing is great i load it up with alternating hard and soft picks so i can easily swap out between songs best i ve ever spent nice strap very comfortable doesn t cut into your body at any point easy to adjust worth the price would definitely buy another i really like the foot switch seems well made for the price and works as advertised i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd
308	when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it there on the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use ive been using this polish since the early s it doesn t smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars what has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them but this polish no way martin knows what they re doing i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes it didn t naturally fit onto my blue yeti mic which is weird since this is a blue mic and its supposedly universal but whatever i made it work for more dollars instead of the meshy pop filter you could have this one which looks and feels like it ll last a looong time if the pop filter fit on right i would have gave stars x being new to guitar this is just way too much fun makes my playing acutally sound like i may know what i am doing easy to setup and easy to use this is the best usb condenser mic i ve ever used i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr i bought the at xlr version simply due to the fantastic results i ve achieved with this one i only use this microphone for podcasting i do not record music with it but i haven t tried yet if you re curious as to the sound quality listen to my podcast rock crushes paper on itunes and zune marketplace just to give you an idea of what i m using windows gb rampentium dual core ghzadobe auditon the build quality is fantastic built like a tank really the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand yes it s a tripod stand but i can t imagine actually being in a spot where i d rather use that then the on stage desktop mic stand anyways great mic can t recommend it enough it s made me check out other audio technica products no complaints whatsoever product is a solid build and prices right knobs work well and the stand doesn t slip legs hold up pretty well also so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews i have five guitars including two les paul s and they hold them just fine i give them four stars the are fine for i believe all guitars at home but i wouldn t use them for retail or something like a school they are made if abs plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it s just a rivet the holds them together the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke like the other reviewer said you really should find a stud to mount them to but if you must use wall anchors use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall all in all these are sturdy and stable when anchored to a stud and i ll use more if i have the need this case is perfect for storing a guitar in i would not recommend using it for traveling anywhere unless in the back of your own vehicle it will protect your guitar but it is not a heavy duty case for the price this would be hard to beat by anyone
309	this works and i really like evans but i got of these and they both looked different and looked cheap although i have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse they cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable i have to take my glasses off when i use them but other than that exactly what i thought they d be when i ordered them i have always liked these sticks they are solid look good and feel good you will always get quality from vic firth only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as vaders i have been using them for about months i play about twice a week and they have maintained a good sound over the past months not too difficult to tune either this on stage asfss gb dual screen pop filter performs great and makes me sound professional i particularly like the flexible gooseneck which makes adjustments on target also the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order a well deserved star rating for this affordable product
310	i purchased this for my year old daughter she is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar i gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach the action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up was ready to go out of the box i almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice i have been playing for about years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet full rich sound if you are looking at this guitar buy it you will not be disappointed i have an esp guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when i got the guitar after buying a line pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear cables etc i originally put it on my wish list because i will admit you don t always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise my guitar fits perfectly it used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut as mentioned the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close but this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag and the pockets oh the pockets they fit all of my gear i have my guitar cable a set of full size sennheiser headphones a line pocket pod all the allen wrenches a tuner and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets and there is room for more if i need it the bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn t stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won t bother anyone and it s fine after a day or two one last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock i did not know this but wow i had no idea how useful that could be i tend to carry my guitar in bag up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful then you have the backpack handles as an option as well i really cannot recommend this bag enough i do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like but i don t really care the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that and while the padding is great i would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel it would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage in case you want it for that kind of thing i don t travel long distances with my guitar but if i did i would use a hard case only for that as i have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear i haven t picked up a guitar in years but this was a long winter and i needed something to occupy my time i broke out my strat and discovered that the amp was dead mice had eaten the wiring crap so online to see what defined state of the art this is it if you need a basic practice amp that with a decent laptop and internet connection can help you produce any sound with a few simple instructions this is it no foot pedals or expensive add ons until you really have to have them just pure creative sound that won t break the bank buy this amp it fits well close well protects well transport well what more can i ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases have not have it that long to rate the durability but i like this case this is real bone the length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar it is just my luck that i have some sandpaper in my garage so i sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about minutes of sanding
311	so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors bass sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great the cry baby has proven itself since the s it is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock it takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level i always purchase grovers for my guitar straps but my gibson les paul standard plus had a bigger strap knob so i bought this dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly a good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect i hit the strings very very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet i don t break many strings i ve been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job yes it could be metal and i wish the button gave a satisfying click when i step on it for under thirty clams i can look past these things i have not had any issues with noise crackling or oscillation i really have no complaints at all with it s performance so i am glad i didn t shell out x more money so i can feel more secure when i unlatch my pedal board in front of gear snobs i don t think i need to run this pedal with every amp i own but it does a great job opening up the sound of boxy or dark sounding amps when i run it in the effects loop of my palomino v great little practice amp btw that little amp sounds huge also great in front of my blues jr if you own an amp with a single tone knob pro jr valve jr etc or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp s controls this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead once my sound is dialed in i leave typically leave it on and forget about it it s also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar i love these strings and the price too since i like to change them every time i do a modification to my guitars every couple months i change something making upgrades they sound great and stay in tune well i ordered these as both a spare and to use with my lower end keyboard a casio px so i could leave my expensive roland rd nx in my home studio much to my surprise this cable is pro quality it s as noise free as mymonster rock instrument cable and i cannot tell the difference between the two cables when i am using this one with either or my keyboards the remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the monster model i ll give the monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction but where it matters signal transmission i frankly cannot tell the two apart part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise and i am sure that the oxygen free copper conductor also has something to do with it both the every expensive monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction i love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the monster it does a better job of holding flex to a minimum although the connectors on the monster are a better quality bottom line the monster cable wins out in few places but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk in fact i will probably keep the monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging for one thing there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one and for another this costs a fifth of what i paid for the monster even if you insist on using the more expensive cables this is a great one to have as a spare
312	these are guitar picks and i don t play guitar so i can t say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were didn t expect much for the price but this is a top notch case for any of the epiphone gibson semi hollowbody guitars great deal to protect your investment this stand was very inexpensive and i thought i could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my epi sheraton ii unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand it seems to be built well enough for what it is but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards also for left right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems tippy the construction itself is ok the rubber tips on the feet seem fine but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short the body cradle is nicely padded but isn t firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design it just isn t all that solid you can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece it ships with an unsightly white upc sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage granted the sheraton ii is a large and heavy guitar but the onstage is billed as heavy duty and to me that means solid which this stand just isn t at least with larger guitars or basses when you use a guitar stand you can t afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood bottom line you get what you pay for for smaller lighter guitars strats and such it may be ok but for dots sheratons s and larger gretch s i just wouldn t trust it and that goes for most basses as well i will need to look for something else
313	these are super strings they will last and last and last and give you great sound easy to put on and tune this is a cool little amp sure it s really nothing to write home about but i like being able to take my strat and just sit somewhere and jam without having to have a generator to supply the power to conventional amps i wouldn t perform with it but great for personal use it s a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp have a twin reverb fender tube ya get one hell of a hum it s so bad i just can t use it at all i m not sure about a transistor amp but who uses those this is a good stand i ve had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before and this one is definitely much sturdier it fits every guitar i ve put in it just fine and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck if you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up i really like this tuner it works very well once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner ie the moving black squares to no longer move then tuning is a simple and accurate thing it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it it cause a few bucks but i think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons that it is worth it these do definitely have more output i really don t know what else to say about them it s all about personal preference so but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too oh one thing i can say is that harmonic squeals and harmonics in general are better defined and sustain longer with these
314	sure there are fancier tremolo pedals out there but i ve always been a fan of the boss tr it s got a more mellow and vintage fender tremolo output and suits my playing to a t pair this beauty up with an electro harmonix cathedral reverb pedal and get lost for days definitely worth the reasonable cost these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price i love the flat low profile right angle plugs my only complaint is i needed some in varying lengths like and so i had to order the planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my older model gold tone banjo ukulele smooth as silk work great as all grovers do this is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range its warm and the modulation sounds great this is not a digital delay the echos will not be exactly what you play but that is why you get an analog delay so you hear the part just a little to the left get it it is tank tough and endless hours of fun i needed a single button switch for my little mustang i that i practice on i ve never owned the fender model switch but i know what it is it will do the job but it s lightweight and won t sit flat on the floor if the cord isn t laying exactly right i searched a little further and ran across this switch on amazon by scrolling down a bit marshall footswitch one button with led by amplifiedparts folks this thing is built like a tank the casing is made of heavy duty i don t know what gauge solid steel there s nothing rinky dink about it i plugged it in to the ftsw jack clicked the button the led lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset again light went out and back to the original it felt solid under my foot and i don t think one can tear the casing up unless they have a or lb sledge hammer i don t know how well the electronics will hold up i just got it today but the switch again feels solid like it s supposed to it cost me with shipping it takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we re use to with amazon but it ships directly from amplifiedparts i believe i m a fender fan but this beats their single switch thanks for reading guys lane h
315	i ve been using the same straploks on all my guitars for the past years i have not had one fail on me ever just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it s on right i ve struggled with the c clip in the past but what are you going to do it s a one time thing when you first install so it s no biggie finally decided in getting the mm picks because i don t like them too thin or too thick this was the perfect gauge i was looking and hoping for the logo will wear out in a few uses but i don t much about that been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it s not wearing out too fast recommended my preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it but it wasn t adjustable i bought this one for its adjustability i bought these because i am constantly loosing screws when i change pickguards or do new builds these are exactly what the doctor ordered original equipment so they re the right screws a must have for every guitarist no matter what brand you own as they work on everything these are well made and don t strip when screwing in for the first time if it s a new project always drill pilot holes anyway i am so glad i bought these one by one they are being used almost time to order another set i store them in a little sandwich bag stars for the price you can t really beat this little amp the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up the little speaker gets kinda muddy but for a bright clean tone it works well the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes but for the money it s a great buy at one point i had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat but then i smartened up worked my calluses to the point where i could probably play s tuned to e with no trouble and realized that these strings worked great for my strat because of the strong tone that these provide and ease of bending on the upper frets these strings also are good for les pauls where the scale length is shorter than the fender guitars making bending like velvet this cable works fine i m going to buy a pair in january i used it live and they are really great durable and it feel s pro try one this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing that s why it s so inexpensive what you see in the picture is what you get but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge it was incredibly easy to install and the sustain is improved one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge the springs in the back keep it back the string tension keeps it balanced in the front what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back
316	i was surprised of how well this stand is made it s worth easily i ve used stands for over years and this is the best i ve owned it serves its purpose doesn t hold as many pick as i expected looking back can t see why i really need it a plastic bag does fine in fact i don t think i ve ever used after the first time i put the picks in it i just use the excess picks i put in a ziplock bag it fits well on my les paul and strat does not fly off the head when playing it s very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting the light works really well and that was what i was looking for as far as accuracy it s right on in either setting i have been playing music for years and often i lose my picks during a performance i took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers best pick ever
317	wow if you need a guitar cable this is it it s metal on the tips and long and black in the body like a long snake with shiny ends no it works just fine and just long enough for my playing if you have a guitar and amp you will need this even without a guitar and an amp it s still fun to have be warned this review may not help you so go on to the next if you need too there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today sure some are said to be the best at this or that but for me the rat is the one that does it all and at a great price to boot this pedal is not new to me i ve had a few of them in the past but the rat is just a great as the older vintage models goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer to a near fuzztone with some warm smooth creamy tones in between remarkable no other distortion pedal can do it as well i ve been playing for decades and have had more than my share of them but the rat delivers no joke it just does it all and well the filter tone is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise that might thow a few folks off but it s a little thing really the filter is the core of it s tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little that s great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit the volume won t go through the roof silent switching no hum no buzz and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit flawless comes to mind here easy to set up strong as a tiger tank and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of or knobs for you to mess with and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past kinda cool if you ask me if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues get yourself a rat if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a boo teek pedal that sits in the rat s shadow buy that high dollar unit and you can at least look good while you play but your tone will still stink its up to you me its a no brainer i go with the rat well like everyone knows this is the copy of the boss but a lot cheaper than that it works just fine and i m happy with it anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal if you want more from a pedal the boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance i bought two sets total great cables no added hum the only down side i will need to buy more effects pedals now and a pedal board good problem to have it tunes without any problems and i love using the word snark i thought the creaters could have implemented the clip feature i have seen on other tuners which tunes through vibrations but it still works great these are a little course for what i wanted brass is a lot better and the edges are too sharp for fast picking they may be giving the strings a little premature wear and the loss of tonality is the problem there are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm
318	i bought this product with the notion of being cheap no refills to buy except distilled water in all actuality its a really simple design i like this design better because of one simple fact if the wood in your guitar is already dry you ll have to refill your humidifier more often initially i d rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers after the guitar gets hydrated i usually end up wetting the sponge every to days it definitely gets taken several time between refills so it s not that much of a hassle overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother try not to over douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar peace out and cheers j to everyone who plays flat picking guitar i m sure you all have your own choice of pick do you even remember why you picked the style you use somehow i started out with fender thins and here i remain at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good i purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though i make every effort to avoid them and to protect the side where i rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time i ve used carnuba car wax many years ago and this is a much higher grade easier to apply easy to remove there were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that i did not notice at first and i was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface they were very minor and did not affect the wood but this will seal them not a sufficient defect to return the instrument another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal i have open tuning machines and before applying tri flow with a pinpoint applicator i used this wax let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel the chrome is gleaming they re really beautiful did a great job on the headstock as well with mop and abalone inlay when the strings were removed also got the tuning pegs this is a om acoustic only way i can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge i used distilled water so if someone left too much water possibly a problem but all worked fine for me i bought this for my new string guild acoustic i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them the reason i tried this one is because it s necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them and with strings it really put a lot of tension on them another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves you slip the included packs into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings they should last months you don t do anything else also comes with a rd one for the headstock with others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they don t dry out i also used a dampit but because it hangs from a cord it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acoustic electric i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also for about yrs have been playing finger style only usually with alternating bass and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice for the song i was performing chords were bm e f m and g st rd position and i needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro i found a very old and very thin peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so i then ordered the fender abalone thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy fender premium celluloid guitar picks pack abalone thinmy ancient peavey broke in half not long after and i continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new fender picks to arrive because i liked the extra flex seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings but since i never liked using a pick at all the fender thin works best for me and i m enjoying learning to use it on songs like eric clapton s interpretation of bessie smith s nobody knows you i ll try the dava picks again later if i feel the need i play simon and garfunkel s version of scarborough fair which is exclusively finger picking and george harrison s here comes the sun where he uses a pick but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle this is all on an acoustic string steel guitar using d addario ej phosphor bronze light strings bristol by blueridge bd dreadnaught acoustic guitar natural d addario ej phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings lightfor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before the fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it s not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings the grip is better on the dava but they aren t going to flex as much undoubtedly better for more accomplished players most advice i ve seen says try em all and decide for yourself i was just amazed and delighted how much easier the fender thin made it for me to get started very accurate when i wanted a g i got a g i have such a refined ear that i only have this around if i have a head cold or you know don t want to show off but it s a good tuner the odor of adhesive lingered for some time but that s not really a problem size and fit were good the storage compartment is nice and large one hinge broke after about a year of normal use it was in the house almost the whole time i just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done i noticed if you look carefully one of the hinges is cracked on both sides so it is not holding anything anymore but it is one of three so the other two still do the job just fine it is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured this was not an expensive guitar and i had a better case so i switched to the better guitar case and used this one for another guitar that i really don t play at all and it just stays in storage this may have been the best money i ve ever spent for a guitar accessory i can dial the pressure to exactly what i need for any spot on the neck it has a smooth action no kerchunk noise my guitar stays in tune when capo ed i love it i own a red blue and now a black one this one is the best yet very easy to read
319	switches channels on my mustang ii like a charm would have received a star rating had it been in a metal enclosure it is plastic but it suits my needs
320	this dual splitter works perfect i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings the most important part of video is the audio you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal i always say half of video is audio for years i used to run a line directly out of the dj s mixer to get my audio the issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking often though the signal is to hot the music is crap or the dj says something stupid with just the dj s voice i can edit the way i want and compress time this product has improved my productions beyond it s price sold i use them to run a separate clean audio line from a dj s wireless systems to my own audio recorder they work perfectly and haven t failed me once this is a great stand the ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit i would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand this is a pretty good stand for the price i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms i have the dr pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is bt for the price this is a good value i received my cables very fast the xlr male the xlr female are well built no humm so that is a plus thank you these headphones are amazing i could not believe the sound quality i have been an audio engineer for over years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price no i do not work for tascam the first pair i bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily so i ordered another pair because the sound is amazing i just need to be more careful next time but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction i have yanked my senhieser s millions of times and the cord never broke so be careful with the cord on this headphone it is not the best but the sound is superior
321	i m very satisfied with the performance of the cm with a few tweaking i could emulate the sound i get from my fulltone ocd i d say it s very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the tone control a toggle switch lets you choose between classic modified setting a tweaker s delight the level knob has a lot of juice if you set it at or o clock it s plenty loud enough although you can t use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the gain knob to zero if you have a single coil it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up not so for humbuckers too much gain you can also stack the cm with other pedals i dusted my old boss ds and run it along with the cm and was able to get some good tones the ds usually hurts my ears but with the cm behind it sweet the hardwire cm may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from klon zvex or lovepedal but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost it s well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to there may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good try it you can t go wrong update did a full comparison between the cm fulltone ocd joyo crunch distortion gain joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the cm and ocd rd mix the cm has the most amount of control with separate high low controls followed by the ocd with just a tone control and the joyo crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control since the cm has the widest tone range i can make it behave like a treble booster nuance the ocd cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic the cm is a close second and the joyo crunch being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind a booster makes your signal louder that has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like mxr micro amp ehx lpb bbe boosta grande modtone etc they keep your guitar s original tone make it louder and when pushed enough will add a good amount of gain grit but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster yes it also makes the signal louder adds gain or a little dirt but also makes your overall sound bigger wider based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like jimmy page duane allman gary moore etc this pedal is really small in size has one knob the footswitch it does have an internal dip switch you open up the back of the pedal choose you own setting i leave at the classic setting turn the gain knob at or o clock leave it on all the time i tried it before after my od pedals and my personal preference is after being in front of the amp it didn t do much when i tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp i put it in the fx loop it boosted the signal alright but i didn t like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my od pedals this is one pedal that will stay on my board i doesn t take up much space built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better it does one job only but it does it so well i have countless delay pedals and racks this inexpensive delay is very special it has the tone and mojo of an analog delay it won t give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for it sounds great clean or dirty it s a relatively short delay which is great for many genres long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal eric johnson like music i would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment it s bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard to your music pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you ll be near the dark side of the moon many musicians use two delay pedals i know i often do this one is my main delay and my nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage both work together to help me find the tones that i am searching for the unit itself seems sturdy and well made i use carbon zinc batteries in mine they just seem to sound better to my ears keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time true bypass and no hiss great surprise as i never took rogue seriously never thought it d be my goto pedal i ve reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them not just because of the price to but also because of their apparent durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price but ultimately i decided that this is somewhere between a and review and i just can t give it the review i ve given the other joyo products i ve tried out thus far extremely high output and high sustain when i first plugged this thing in i had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal i would try out with my les paul and vox combo amp with the dials all at o clock big mistake this pedal has an extremely high output depending on the gain setting i was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the volume set at around this isn t necessarily a bad thing and it s certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder a frequent criticism of the boss ds but it s something to be aware of also i read several comments here that this isn t a high gain distortion i couldn t disagree more this thing has tons of gain i think people are thrown off by two things the name which pays tribute to the mi audio crunchbox it clones and the clarity transparency of the tone particularly the higher end range that shines through at all gain levels crunch in my mind refers to a punchy cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character the crunch distortion has a tone that doesn t really breakup or get fizzy as you turn up the gain but that s not what gain really is the gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note s but i think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesn t crack up hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up this actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work also which is one of the jf s strengths the setup is weird but workable because of everything i described above you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want my level is usually around to and is still very loud the crunchy classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist but only at around to of the gain setting and i had the tone knob generally working from o clock to o clock as it got a little too bright to go any higher again this is with les paul humbuckers ultimately what i decided was that this pedal has enough bass not too much in the midrange and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly if you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments i d imagine this pedal would do the trick it s costs less than half of many of it s true competitors while the affordability aspect is distinct from quality it cannot be ignored part of my initial disappointment was based on a side by side comparison with my mxr custom badass distortion the latter did have a fuller sound to it and was arguably better for rhythm work but that s an custom shop pedal from mxr try comparing this pedal to a boss ds or mxr distortion and it blows them out of the water in my opinion i m not sure want to roll with the crunch distortion being the only dirt box on my board but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind like a lead gain boost you could afford this and joyo s excellent ultimate drive overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even boss distortion pedals go for update about a week into owning this pedal i did revise this score from a to a rating if you graded the pedal in a vacuum i could absolutely see a rating for the price tag but ultimately there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that i haven t had with other joyo products so the score should reflect that please note also which i didn t realize before that the internal trim pot for presence is not easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it a distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment and i have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything i love this little tuner it s better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar and as accurate and easier to use than the one on my vox tonelab st i m planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case i bought this based on video reviews on the net my first impressions to my ears if the ocd ultimate od simulates fat power tube distortion this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre amp with a bit of edge sharpness the kind of edge the tube amps have the focus knob seems like a tone knob maybe more in the upper mids than the treble but it does the job well i wish it had a bit more gain surprisingly this pedal with the gain on and the tone on gives me a great metal tone all by itself if i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost it gets me exactly where i d want to be a dry tight metal tone kinda ish and while this isn t the purpose of the pedal it is how i ve ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps it s tight its raw there is no fizz and no boomyness just a healthy low end crank the knobs on this thing to and you have a very aggressive tight tone that makes even my marshall class tight and grindy enough for scandinavian style metal over all though this is great for lightly distorted edge of distorted sounds it gave my clean tone a sharper more amp like tone that is midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle i think this would be great for hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff it just has that chimey vintage amp character very early marshalls older fenders with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation if your clean channel is overly flat this will liven it up to more sharp scooped tone which to my ears sounds more vintage basically from hendrix to modern de tuned metal with a definite mids emphasis not s marshall mids but modern mids emphasis
322	i love love love these strings super great sound and super long life i ve had these on my acoustic for over months before and the sound is still awesome i ll definitely only buy these from now on spend a few more bucks and get a padded one this one is comfortable for mins then it s cramp time just save yourself the hassle this one is too cheap to return and while it s ok it s not great for long term playing i read the reviews here on amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn t expensive i only needed one and expected the package to come with just one but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise i ve had them for months now and they haven t failed me yet they keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and i had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor the only complaint i have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick and they are an extremely snug fit which makes me kinda nervous however i keep them as tight as i can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far not sure why the other reviews were so negative but i have no complaints i ve had this for about weeks now and this capo is simple and works great it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well if you know how much pressure to apply to the frets the capo works great though i always have to do a bit of fine tuning as was expected in the first place i love how cheap it was compared to the other capos and yes it s not made of plastic this stand is made of quality products it cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right this is our second one as we both have guitars worth every penny this amp really shines in the distortion modes i don t really care for the clean sounds but the metal tones are as good as i ve ever heard out of a low cost amp i wish i had found this amp sooner it blows the other brands away
323	works great just clip it on and jam out forget the screw on type and spend the few extra bux for this one you ll be happier trust me i love these customs inbetween the lights and mediums you get the bright booming sound nice bends and of course the longer playing life i ve used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in them to brigthen the sound a tad i would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye i love this light it runs on electric so no need for batteries the goosenecks are metal and well made and the led lights have switches that can turn on single or double leds on each side it will clip on anything you want to hold it it s simple well made and works great
324	not perfect but a solid stand prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do and the bottom part that holds the guitar isn t fixed so it s good and bad good because it ll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do sometimes it just swings around annoyingly i had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acoustic electric i was so used to the big klunky ones that you balance on your leg while trying to tune i had no idea these even existed after using it to tune different prospects in a row i decided to buy one on the spot the tuner that is it took another hour to decide on a guitar it is very easy to use the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment i like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there s a drop d song or just tweak something that goes out of tune does exactly what it is supposed to do and it stays out of the way not quite as loaded as the red all instrument snark but it gets the job done is very sensitive to vibration this guitar is pretty good for the price the only reason it has stars is because my first and nd string keep detuning might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad i think i may need to tighten some screws anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical nice item works well great price no need to own one of the more expensive ones for the job it does i have to type more oops got enough typed
325	i got this guitar for my year old son he loves it this is a buitifull clasic guitar with a good clear sound when he is not messing with the knobs i would definatly purchase this again i bought this amp as a back up for my year old son and to take to the park this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it i am using it to record my garage band s demo to get us more gigs i have been a gigging musician for over years had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it i had two guitar tracks a bass track and drums tracks from garageband all laid down easy to plug in i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband very quality recordings so far like it so far edit put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic pg used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track easy to layer over harmonies still have yet to mic up a drum kit still enjoying the product still amazed at the ease of use did try to install software on a pc with vista no luck edit mic d up a drum kit into a mixer lined it out to this interface i then mixed the drum mics with the mixer you can record the drums as a single track so once they re recorded you can not mix them individually ie snare kick and so on i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way i am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it but as for now i am very pleased this amp is small in size but full of sound because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks very responsive very clean sounding this amp is well worth the price
326	awesome tuner really fast and responsive best of all it is accurate enough so that using this for setups has resulted in a much quicker easier process than i had anticipated nice and bright so i can clearly see it on stage in the dark occasionally i get a small pop when i engage it but not that frequently this pedal feels good and sturdy too i really cannot see anyone breaking it unless you feel the need to leap from the monitors on to the switch price is easy enough that if anything should happen to it i would not think twice about picking another one up it cannot be denied that the boss dd is a versatile effective product and it does exactly what it claims to do and does it well but i have a mixed relationship with this pedal on one hand it does so many things with reverse modulate analog settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings it s a versatile tool in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing one thing in a live setting you have to set it and forget it period the four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are un usable cannot be used in a live dark stage environment so when i m at home putzing around on my guitar the boss dd sits on my pedal board and gets used but when i have a gig it get s pulled from the board and the mxr carbon copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category the mxr carbon copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions so it gets used up there when the pressure is onthe boss dd is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment only if you go live with it good luck well worth the bucks i paid analog with true bypass easy to use with one knob and has nice high quality chorus effect mxr built like a tank works with my boss ds ac adapter too this is an a pedalit s small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly the mxr micro flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesif you want a flanger to do any more than that you re just goofing off mostly i need a subtle wash for flanger work and the mxr micro is perfect for that
327	i agree with all of the reviews but have found another area to use fast fret on the nut when tuning the strings especially the lower wound strings hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut dab fast fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced i ordered these as both a spare and to use with my lower end keyboard a casio px so i could leave my expensive roland rd nx in my home studio much to my surprise this cable is pro quality it s as noise free as mymonster rock instrument cable and i cannot tell the difference between the two cables when i am using this one with either or my keyboards the remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the monster model i ll give the monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction but where it matters signal transmission i frankly cannot tell the two apart part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise and i am sure that the oxygen free copper conductor also has something to do with it both the every expensive monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction i love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the monster it does a better job of holding flex to a minimum although the connectors on the monster are a better quality bottom line the monster cable wins out in few places but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk in fact i will probably keep the monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging for one thing there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one and for another this costs a fifth of what i paid for the monster even if you insist on using the more expensive cables this is a great one to have as a spare not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip solid plastic brass threading adjustable pivot screw i ve always been pleased with on stage products even down to there cheap clips i do like these strings had a few packs of these from christmas opened up one recently and the string or st string was not in there next time i m gonna have to open up the package to make sure they re all in there should measure them too didn t open them to keep them sealed until i was ready to use them no more i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far
328	tested this on my blue yeti usb microphone and could tell the difference with the pop filter on right away good investment i cant play real guitars but i did buy this for rock band this is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way this has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it i even use it when im drumming i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has oh its almost impossible to knock down too believe me the cats have tried after trying to rig something up i decided to just go with this mount for my yeti it did not disappoint the fit was perfect install was easy use your logic and the microphone looks sexy as hell on it
329	i recently bought this may to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine pros non oily water like consistency leaves no residue behind slight non chemical odor that doesn t linger on your guitar removes smudges fingerprints etc and leaves a nice shine comes with a large lint and dust free fast drying cloth black less expensive than most other guitar polishes cons the pump sprays in a very wide area so be careful to avoid spraying strings pickups etc the polish in the bottle works well and the lint free cloth works well too i can t see spending more for gibson or dunlop polish kits when this work just fine as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work it had been dropped on it s head after repairing and playing it it still sounded like crap so i had these strings they were cheap and i put them on only took about minutes to restring and was well worth the effort okay the guitar and i am too embarrassed to give the brand isn t my gibson les paul or my fender american strat but damn it sounds good now if i didn t have so many guitars i might keep this one but i will probably sell it to make room for another these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them honestly i won t restring my fender with them i ll use the fender bullets but these are great for about any electric with guitars crappy strings kill it great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great i will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars a great deal on what i consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there do the big names in the music biz use ernie ball strings yes and for good reason while it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety i have found that for my usa stratocaster that the ease of play with the strings is the clincher and they provide an amazingly full sound with no stress on the fingers at all this one works it can t make me play any better wish it could but it wont make me play any worse
330	just changed strings on my epi les paul and this winder cutter performed flawlessly the winder fit the winding keys nicely and didn t come anywhere near touching my guitar s finish the cutter snips the strings with no effort huge time saver and works as promised very glad i bought the planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter i tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars therefore after playing i always wipe down my strings to extend their life i ve used other microfiber cloths but they tend to break easy and leave fuzzies on the strings which i then have to remove one by one this cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use it is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use i liked my first one so much that i am putting in another order it didn t naturally fit onto my blue yeti mic which is weird since this is a blue mic and its supposedly universal but whatever i made it work for more dollars instead of the meshy pop filter you could have this one which looks and feels like it ll last a looong time if the pop filter fit on right i would have gave stars x now it doesn t work same day i got it in my control panel the mic is there but it doesn t pick up any sound followed all the instructions emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been days no answer maybe i m being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it if you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment i have tried other picks like this that had points which wen t as confortable this one is more confortable and has great grip if you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out i received a selection of pics for a reasonable price the variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options
331	not much i can add to the review that isn t well covered already it s a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment there are some design flaws that i could see giving some people trouble over time but overall it s a great product i just wanted to add that it will work for the hd x with enough room for all the cables power supplies needed for effects pod digital wireless rig playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings i ve preferred just to strum using my fingers because traditional plastic picks are just too harsh and loud even felt picks are too harsh not to mention the dust shedding they do the wedgie is exactly what i ve been looking for harder than my thumb softer than plastic or felt the mm hard rubber wedgie is the goldilocks pick right in the butter zone i tried the soft and medium wedgies but both were just too soft the soft wedgie over grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone the medium is better but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft but the hard wedgie is the clear winner i get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings the only negatives i ve found are they can leave skid marks on your pick guard no big deal as it wipes right off they break down faster than i d like of course that could just be my expectations still if you re looking a softer than plastic pick this is the one to get no pick noise just strings i couldn t be happier this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades that is what i wanted but that is also why i got it weathered to speed up about years of personality i m not sure how you would wear it out really its buttery soft and doesn t have a strange fabric suede backing so it won t muck up your clothes pill or crumble the only minus is that its a standard inches though the description says its long pretty standard vs all other straps i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural it looks wonderful i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it update since i got the strap as a christmas gift i ve worn it to class and jam sessions i started getting nice compliments about the guitar thought the guitar is beautiful i ve had it for a while i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar beauty and function this is heavy but strong very comfortable i cannot carry it around with me but it works well at home i recommend it i ve been playing for about years most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga my performance guitar is a martin hd and my practice guitar is a blueridge br i wanted a third guitar just for kicks i d been looking a taylors but didn t want to spend that much money enter the seagull s a fellow picker asked if i d ever heard of a seagull i hadn t he said they were nice guitars and i ought to check them out so i did a little research i first read all the nice reviews here for the s and then went on youtube and listened to a few my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s and i really like it i choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft and i understand that the spruce has more volume i got the s today and this evening my wife with her taylor gs mini and i with this s played smokey mountain memories nice real nice guitar i found that the action on this s is pretty good out of the box i m going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time if he can make the action better i ll let him i m also going to put on some elixir light strings i don t know what kind of strings are on it out of the box but the bottom line is that i am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this seagull coastline spruce s acoustic guitar right out of the box i m glad i bought it the snark sn is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate i beg to differ this is the most accurate headstock tuner that i have ever used and it also has a built in metronome which i never use but could come in handy another thing is the price point which is simply amazing the blue color is a bit annoying however and i d like it if they came out with a black sn the visibility of the screen is amazing and i can see it even with the sun reflecting off of it or in a completely dark room if your a musician or want to be recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well i have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said you cannot beat a tascam recorder for ease of operation features and sound quality enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
332	this amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from modelling amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five flavor settings in each they are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you ve switched gears here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you d have to be right up on them to see how they are set i ve had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned it s velcroed on there just fine the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather like material plenty loud i have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar as that s what i learned on as a child i can t afford it at the moment so i decided to give these a shot these do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination i didn t expect them to but a guy can dream can t he anyway what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly bright takamine it also helped with the rather high action they play and sound softer it s almost like having a new guitar during the stringing stretching process i broke the g string go easy they are silk after all and so had to use a standard bronze replacement i asked my non music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the oddball string and she got it right on the first try that s how much of a difference these strings make they sound less metallic that may sound obvious but my point is that it s a big difference enough for her untrained ears to hear i m still saving up for a classical but i really love these strings and will be using them on my tak going forward i purchased a set of fender vintage tremelo tension springs in order to beef up the tremelo tension on an inexpensive squier jagmaster guitar that i recently purchased these springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the jagmaster the loop actually goes all the way around which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar and it seems that they are of a higher tension highly recommended as replacement springs or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars let me first start off with the sizing when they say fits soundholes from they really mean it you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is smaller than the specifications i know i did my friend s oscar schmidt sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well the edges did not catch completely and it looks terrible my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole it did not fit at all you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard the main issue is the sound yes it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming slightly but enough to tell however it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes for me that does not justify it a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return they resell as brand new if it looks brand new the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened does it matter in practical terms no not for this sort of item i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies
333	this plug works very well i like the right angle connectors i have a korg pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals it included a multi plug cable but not a right angle one the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard this works much better this is the only brand i would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play these are well worth the money what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it don t get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to e flat much easier than on a non chromatic tuner but that s all i use it for i prefer my older tuners that light up this screen is really dim and there s not a back light my guitar room isn t super bright and it s very difficult to read guess that s why the price is so cheap i m not on tour with any group i play for church and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home with other musicians willing to give their time plus an occasional gig for a town celebration or some such activity i ve got a few sound effects pedals and processors i like using but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car this mini pedaltrain easily holds four of my favorite devices it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy etc the case is awesome too heavy duty good stuff the board came with velcro tie wraps power head etc to mount and use your devices i had it up and running in a few minutes and it makes my travel and play experiences easy without looking for a roadie to get help the angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect since i first got it i ve rearranged once already talk about easy you ll be glad to have your sound effects mounted wired and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear tear on wires from just handling a booster makes your signal louder that has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like mxr micro amp ehx lpb bbe boosta grande modtone etc they keep your guitar s original tone make it louder and when pushed enough will add a good amount of gain grit but there is something else going on with the xotic ep booster yes it also makes the signal louder adds gain or a little dirt but also makes your overall sound bigger wider based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like jimmy page duane allman gary moore etc this pedal is really small in size has one knob the footswitch it does have an internal dip switch you open up the back of the pedal choose you own setting i leave at the classic setting turn the gain knob at or o clock leave it on all the time i tried it before after my od pedals and my personal preference is after being in front of the amp it didn t do much when i tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp i put it in the fx loop it boosted the signal alright but i didn t like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my od pedals this is one pedal that will stay on my board i doesn t take up much space built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better it does one job only but it does it so well i ve had a jam man for some time which as a tech person i ve found incredibly difficult to figure out perhaps i didn t take the time anyways this pedal on the other hand is a leap forward in the opposite direction i didn t need instructions just punched in layed down a riff and jammed for about hours straight i did this for two days in a row it s simple built well and and fun to use can t recommend it enough it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
334	this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard but for dollars its well worth the price this is a great product and i highly recomend it the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals cheap mass produced housed in a plastic casing but the fab series offers affordable effects to at surprisingly good quality and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost times more if this pedal cost i might gripe about how tight together the input output v jacks are i might also complain about the weird position of the mix speed and depth controls on the top of the unit or the small footswitch but at this price for it to sound this good i can t complain at all don t expect the fab series to be good at everything but if there s and effect out there that you only use once in awhile especially anything involving modulation or delay the fab series is going to do it well and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals it s just a great option to have for casual budget guitarists overdrive that wont drive you over love it for the price as usual danelectro delivered i love their products for that reason they sound like a couple hundred bucks and yet first of all this strap looks super cool the hootenany style is sweeeet i have this on a cream colored strat like guitar and it looks great the reason for only four stars is that the material is a bit thin but hey for this price i am not expecting a levy s strap all in all this is a great guitar strap throw some strap locks on it and away you go
335	that cloth they should have included something that doesn t fall apart otherwise it s great i use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned but i m with other people here who commented that you can t really tell how much of the stuff is left inside good idea to keep more than one of these around it didn t seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless it may work well with dunlop picks but not for theplanet waves standard guitar picks duralin blue gt medium heavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold it has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot i ve found it mostly not useful thus far maybe it would help more when playing live so i can grab for a pick and know they will be there this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case i don t have any complaints my fender strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn t the most durable case i wouldn t use it to ship my guitar it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next well it s made nicely but output is not strong sensitivity brings notes together on the bright side but there s little ciean sustain i m going to work with it more that s compressor s it does the job though i wasn t impressed by the lack of range but then again i ve never found a use for the more extreme settings on a phaser anyways it seems that this unit keeps the effect within a safe and comfortable range and that s okay with me title says it all i guess it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness that i m not crazy about in dunlops and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands bought these months ago and i ve got to say they re very durable too certainly more so than the small pick alternatives i tried but dont let that deter you that just means it will break in that much more quickly my favorite strap is not padded in any way like this strap but a little wider i use this on a telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar i hooked a couple pcs round head strap locks black for guitar schaller styleon it and away we went the strap is made in canada from decent quality leather not bonded and the gold fender logo is understated yet classy it s a classic strap from fender what else is there to say i was unaware when i originally purchased these that there was a threaded mic mount on the back extension pole i already had a couple posi lok boom arms that i popped on them and was able to reclaim two floor mic stands and save a little bit more floor space they are fairly well constructed for the price and fit perfectly in my small home studio the mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore while not as soft and supple as suede straps i am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing it is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker all in all it s a good strap for the money which wasn t much so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles would never use a pitch pipe again and i guess i might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these i really like this cable maybe it s not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine i keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away it probably stretches feet if you really need it too what i really like is that it s compact and i don t have cables laying all over the floor overall it s a solid cable for practice i ll buy more tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank i ve had it for over years and done many gigs and a couple tours and all my tc pedals are in perfect condition now for tone this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when i m leading worship n my band we play heavier music so i was messing around with this overdrive so i could use it there as well and i discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal it makes your tone really muddy but if you send a dirty tone overdrive or light distortion into it it screams beautifully
336	elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar d addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the elixir s these are very nice bright strings the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings i like that compared to elixir s these are a bit brighter with good feel call me old school i hate the packaging these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag ah you know i m just so used to strings that are individually looped two strings looped together makes a mess while i m restringing a guitar when i unwrap that pair i ve got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench the neat freak in me hates that i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible but darn it paper envelopes it feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials not some environmental cause post consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load i know d addario loves the color coded ends on my acoustic guitar that s irrelevant the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs on my electric guitars i don t like the look at all i prefer gold or silver rings at the end if the strings are in individual labeled packages there s no need for the colors d addario loves the color coded end rings so much they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging i have yet to decode their colors or naming system i normally use gauge strings in my acoustic guitar i tested these at gauge and am surprised how much i like them the slightly thicker string is not bad oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixir s my reason for using the original d addario strings is low price if somebody is doing gigs nightly those uncoated strings are the only way to go strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician for the home enthusiast coated strings make a ton of sense they do last longer i think they are worth the premium price now there are two choices for excellent coated strings in the end the packaging the color coded end rings the crazy package coding and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar what they sound like and play like is the most important thing and in that regard these are excellent strings i didn t want to spend too much for a guitar that i wasn t sure if i would like it or not there were a few at the local music store but times the price they were good quality and if this didn t work out then i would have probably gone that route to my surprise this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar the only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar the local shop only charged me to shave them down i replaced the strings right away i m completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it definitely worth the price you pay for a ten spot ya can t do better matte flat black finish is nice great durable foam contact points for cradling baby double dog dare ya to do better you just cannot excellent deal i did a lot of research and i finally found the right capo it is a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for it is made from a very good material and i have been using this for years there are some others capo that are less expensive but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar this capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension i like this and i highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level good luck this is the best clip on tuner out there it s dead accurate doesn t bounce around like dial needle tuners and it s easy to read you just clip it to your headstock either acoustic or electric turn it on position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly highly recommended for all string players especially electric or acoustic guitar or dobro there are other tuners by snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges so check out what suits your needs
337	as a beginner playing guitar i was looking for something mid range and this is it it holds tune and has not failed yet since i am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice as i get better i will upgrade so far the only maintenance has been to tune it and clean the strings and that is normal i bought this to use in children s church works great has a nice sound well made it has held up with all the kids using it great value for the price i purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear this stand is very stable and useful so if you want a cheap way to rack your stuff this is the way to go gls audio ft mic cable is very high quality you will not be disappointed low cost long lasting i m very satisfied very bright of them are great for lighting up the front stage of a band which is my application for them worth the money
338	i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel these strings are what i needed and they perform d addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar bought as a gift for my son and he s very pleased with it what can you say it s a guitar strap it does the job and looks good and for a levy s leather strap is a good deal i got the gold and it s good looking without being garish i m just getting into miking and recording music mainly to get my son off to a good start i m kind of feeling my way when i wasn t getting a good result from a dynamic mic a friend suggested a pre amp and or a condenser mike i ended up getting both the amp tube pre amp and running this through the amp into my tascam dp wow i have to work on getting the levels matched properly but this thing is just so much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar our music sessions have slowed down a bit he just turned so hanging with the old man is the last thing on his mind lol but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable includes a nice hard plastic carry case too for this kind of money you can t really go wrong well that s overstating it a little but several people told me i wouldn t like fw strings on my bass i wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound smoother and more mellow i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar so i put these on my musicman sting ray bass i only have a little peavey practice amp which may account for how bright these still sound but i love them i have to dial the active eq treble control all the way down this is just a bright sounding bass but i wanted more of a stand up doghouse bass sound like early basses had i have a low level hofner violin bass also with fws on it it shipped with rws what were they thinking but i loves me my musicman and i love the sound of these strings oddly a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut but it doesn t seem to affect the sound as soon as i get a real amp i expect these to completely satisfy and they will pop but then again this is an awesome bass made during leo s time with mm but if you want that real vintage sound these are pretty damn good lack of a good amp and not knowing how long they ll last is why i gave them stars otherwise star all the way this was a bit hard to install over or under the strings we tried both over the strings it would slide below the nut which isn t good under the strings and it muffled a few so we kind of wove it above some and under others other than that it works fine holds the strap with no problems and it puts the name martin on the lowliest box guitar in hindsight i d have probably just got a strap button and mounted it to the base of the neck but if you don t want to do that and hate the lace approach this will do the trick it may even fit better on different guitars ours is a year old norma that actually sound amazing considering its origins guess old wood just sounds better and the price is very right to be able to claim you own a martin lol gls cables are quality cables at a good price i suppose you could spend more and still be happy but why not spend less if it works as well then spend your savings on something else i ve been happy with all of gls products so far
339	i usually just use my fingers to strum my tenor uke but there are songs where a pick is more appropriate i used to have an old felt pick made back in the s but it disintegrated over time and the newer felt picks i ve found just don t feel the same i bought a set of soft medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i m really happy with the results i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie s really nice for my jazz bass i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars but the wedgie s are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments i d love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday but it still works very well for me it s a nice little amp for practice it lacks volume and low end for performance i have used it for several months with no problems it works fine if it will reach your equipment three more inches would be nice if it will reach it s great works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking seems like it draws current even when it s off i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar i make sure to turn this tuner off before putting the guitar away and when i get around to playing the guitar again to days later the battery is already drained this happened at least three times already the tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that i have to compare against i don t know which one is more accurate the good thing is it s very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it i probably won t buy again for my other and future guitars
340	not that it s a huge deal but i quite prefer this capo over any other capo i ve used it just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that snap into place i own several of these now and whenever i mis place one which happens too often i come back to purchase another if you re looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model i bought of these because of the ridiculously low price i figured i d get my money s worth from them regardless they work fine so well that i thought i would buy a few more for the studio the price went up nearly on them though bah i have four of these and will continue to use this product you ll purchase this system first then all you need to do is get the replacement packs for my taylor baby the string spacing was a little small but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars very easy to use as a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition i would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments these are great little tuners you can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly which is especially helpful when you re breaking in strings or any time i ve played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts i love these picks i bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy it is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely
341	they feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them fair priced and i love the color of the green ones i like the mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard great for someone looking to play blues or rock cheap and easy to use can t beat these picks these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my strat good sustain and strings are holding up well these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my lp good sustain and strings are staying in tune well very comfortable strap the cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far i could not be happier excellent sound easy controls very responsive and is better than advertised the effects are excellent and feel and quality of parts are wonderful buy it as good as advertized rugged and sturdy live up to expectations and is comfortable i would definitely buy a few more of these
342	this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass i gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid i only use something different if i need a longer reach and i love the tweed cover very satisfied with this one haven t had this long but so far it s just about perfect i had bought another on stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness on stage my see review this one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable and only costs a few bucks more fourteen buckos at present i ve got a gooseneck and a light ish condenser mic with a shock mount on it and it s as steady as can be i m convinced even heavier loads will be no problem if you re in need of a side boom look no further i am a professional musician keyboard player and keyboard collector mostly vintage poly analog but also a ton of mono phonics modulars and built your own kit units shrugging ambik etc not that that has a lot to do with a pedal however i do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that i use to make my living have purchased every brand and style of pedal for the purpose of this we ll stick with sustain compared to other units it is heavier than most and i find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic it is just an on off switch so no half modeling here the only reason i gave this unit stars instead of is because yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps of the market who will get home and if they hadn t thought to check may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed a backward sustain pedal is not fun many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse switch that would eliminate that potential headache these days most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on you may very well cause an issue you don t expect and are confused by turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases so build quality excellent durability excellent i ve had a bunch of cheaper pedals used on stage break at the switch point or at the jack this yamaha endures design some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure i don t see that much anymore but so long as you aren t on glossy hardwood this will stay i place with no issue i ve read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard or something similar all a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit and disengaged when the pedal is released there are no electronics so if it doesn t work there are three points to look at unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all connected to the metal posts inside the housing there are usually two wires of differing color if one is disconnected the pedal will cease to function and in rare instances cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely this is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder jacks are points of strain so it isn t inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected the switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged the switches in the yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part would be unlikely to wear out with normal use i have however needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment this was easy and a quick fix even with limited tools the third option is the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse this can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity switch if it senses on startup or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether doing nothing at all it is or or a problem with the jack on the keyboard highly unlikely but i ve seen it happen hopefully this helps some who have posted questions to conclude a nice pedal for the money much better build than the m audio decent just not as nice as the yamaha certainly not a bad unit on stage if they can t get most of their mic stands right i don t trust them with even basic electronics or generics i use to mount a portable digital recorder onto the side of a mic stand very stable clamp mechanism works very well price is good nice to have in your gadget bag works great i have the same effect on my alesis midi keyboard as i do with my more expensive yamaha keyboard which has a sustain pedal chrome is great quality and it has good weight so it s not tinny if you are a mobile dj that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these it saves me minutes per event setup and break down just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event what is there to say if you re looking at this cable then you must have some knowledge of tone loss simple if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal buy mogami i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables but you will not hear a difference lifetime warranty and you won t be replacing it any time soon works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio all i own are mogami cables check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord goodbye pops and noise i used it to whenever i am changing guitar strings and whenever i am tuning and intonating my fender strat the surface is perfect no rolling away of screws no scratching of the guitar shiny finish perfect
343	no complaints here the quality is great the sounds is excellent and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp use it all the time it s a good product works well and does what it s meant to do i m glad i bought it over the other main pop filter as that one has bad reviews man ya ll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it s all good and stuff man because like when you be spittin some sik leerix and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me ay yo let s go i m using four of these for podcasting they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used i am completely happy it arrived in a small package with main pieces in it the base the bottom fork and the top fork and it didn t take much assembly to put it together it does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well i will probably buy a couple more of these the only downside i can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin i hope this doesn t eventually have a hole wear through it but over time i could see it happening i suppose by that time i could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though
344	i use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great it s got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too battery lasts for months well done behringer this is an absolute must have item for any gigging drummer holds your drink just like it says it will what more can you ask for out of a drink holder no more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy at least not unintentionally pro bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied i am not having any problems fastening to a stand or cam corder and i am able to clamp the swivel lock very securely i am only using for light weight applications certainly worth the love this thing it sounds awesome and is built like a tank it sound as good as to monitors and the music stand mounting is clever does everything i want in a personal stage monitor being a musician i wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams with the support of this little recorder i have about of what i have played over the last year available to me sound quality there are many options to select from sample rate type mp wav and a number of other options i have mainly recorded wav at when i am done recording i normally will edit it in a daw and then convert to mp for storage i would say the audio is good not great but certainly right on for what i am doing considering the price power is about hours of continuous recording i can fit about hours on high quality on the gb card this is usually a little more than i require when jamming i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels many times at a jam you don t necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally several times it had to sit next to the drummer or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case and i was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated one instrument may be louder than another but then i tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance the only times it has failed has been i didn t have enough battery i didn t format the card and it ran out of room or i forgot to press the record button twice before recording the first arms the track the second begins the recording for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case i have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder just the external mics if your a musician or want to be recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well i have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said you cannot beat a tascam recorder for ease of operation features and sound quality enough said buy a tascam if you serious about your music
345	got what i needed a basic capo for a good price the tension is a little tighter than i d like but works for me covers all strings and depresses them fully i don t use it often so i can t speak to its longevity but good for me i tried these strings on my zager guitar the are certainly ok and play fine they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru zager just a little cheaper in cost perhaps maybe they will last longer i had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity i put in there for the guitar wood i live in hot and very dry arizona these have not rusted so far spend a few more bucks and get a padded one this one is comfortable for mins then it s cramp time just save yourself the hassle this one is too cheap to return and while it s ok it s not great for long term playing i purchased a pack of the soft rubber wedgie s as an add on to a larger order as such i found them to be a reasonable value however i m not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic i think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or uke they are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort i love the very soft warm sound they provide i use them mostly late at night when i can t sleep and want to play but the rest of the family is still sleeping not quite as effective on the e a and d steel strings but certainly playable not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords thanks spo simple no frills stand only problem i ve had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off a lil glue will fix it just haven t had time everywhere i go anytime i hear ukulele i also hear aquila strings i ve tried several different uke strings for both my soprano and my concert ukes and i ve got to say these are not my favorites i think the sound these strings produce are overly bright a little squeaky and they don t seem to allow for smooth transitions from chord to chord in my opinion at least for the two ukes i have these strings did nothing for their tone i much prefer the martin clear flurocarbon strings
346	i ve been using a crybaby for going on years now some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way well i ve never noticed to me these always feel perfect also you can adjust which part of the sweep you re using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the pot i ve tried other wahs morley doesn t do it for me and the vox is very good i just have always gone with what i knew no complaints with the crybaby if you are familiar with shubb s they are by far the best capo you can get some people do like the big close pin but if you don t buy a shubb it s a stand it does what it s supposed too that being said i try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable i use these to put my instrument down for a short time only these are by far some of the better made ones i ve found without a contraption to lock in my instrument and give a false sense of security these are made no where near how they used to be years ago in a negative way but the foam medical piping has gotten better as the old stuff used to scuff and deteriorate really quickly i d prefer a better stand however i question it s existence
347	have had one for years has survived many gigs and rehearsals and many months in the trunk of my car harsh environment strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job the price was right may buy another for a spare this is my second and i love them so much they work flawlessley and tune is amazing get one and dont hesitate for years i used kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue planet waves ns has a smoother handle that doesn t stick out as much and i ve had no issues with gripping it on or off so far it is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly if you re looking to buy a capo i d recommend this over a kyser
348	i like it grip is good and the thickness is just right for me i wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is these strings last and they moderated some of the booming i get from other strings i use the exp phosphor bronze on my other dreads these are by no means touring cases they re inexpensively made which is a good thing because i hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and i don t tour that said they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren t out on a stand i ve got about a dozen guitars and when they re not gonna be played anytime soon i want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag these do very nicely for that purpose they are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig but i wouldn t put a pricey guitar into this case if i new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it so i recommend them but be aware of its limitations i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding i was wrong they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal i have a schecter hellraiser with emg x series pickups and they go great with them they are easier to bend too which is great i no longer use heavier strings like i use too these will be my mainstay one day i was getting ready to play a show and stuck my hand in my pocket my pick was gone i checked in my case no picks so minutes before i start i m scrambling all over trying to find a pick luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird i went and played my set using one of these and i absolutely loved it the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well and this was the first time i ve played with a pick that i knew wasn t going to come flying out of my fingers after i got home from the show i jumped on amazon and ordered a pack for myself like i said i love these things
349	i only use dunlops for a number of reasons first the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions two thumbs up use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick i use the mm mm and mm sizes these worked fine the mistake i made was buying them hastily i needed nylon core strings not steel my mistake i loaded them up anyway sounded great for the money you cannot beat these strings i change strings every other time i play a show about once a month and these always last and sound good perfect for ibanez guitars with special tuning handy well made small easy to see great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to i like this pick the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers its not soft or to hard of a pick i like it great deal on a capo it s about the same quality as one i would buy for x the amount elsewhere it takes a while for the shipping but that s stated in the description i was pleasantly suprised i would recommend this capo
350	works just fine except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels not sure what that s about but i m not very picky and know nothing about guitar stands so maybe it s supposed to this strap is sturdy and looks good and goes well with a fender strat it doesn t come off every time you get to jamming out and forget you are not sitting down so you don t have to worry about dropping your guitar so you can focus on rocking out i love these picks and the mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing who would have thought you could buy quality bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your dvds the strings are with out a doubt real fender strings and even with shipping coasts they are still comparably priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store but because you don t have the opportunity to compare strings i do recommend that you know what you want i ve also purchased top shelf guitar stings as well as a variety of other products from amazon and have always been satisfied with the qualiy and service i love these clip on vibration reading tuners this was the second one i tried the first was a barcus berry which worked equally well they both have lots of features such as tap tempo up and down tuning adjustments with the barcus berry it was the first one after trying the snark which is a cool name and a lot more colorful i tuned up a brand new guitar in a store out of the box in less than minutes never came close to doing that before that convinced me the quicktunes i had been using were accurate but these seemed to be better and get you perfect i have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments which makes sense they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric from the literature it seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals that have been raved about hello raving bout this i seen on amazon they are cheaper i bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for here they are around to bucks these type of tuners especially the intellitouch are popular wih bluegrass folk like me the grapics on this are great no more shaky needle just a dead on still reading when you are perfect i used this on my bass and i don t know what more you can say about it it works and does at it is supposed to i have no issues with quality or feel it s too loose
351	i purchased three of these three different colors to make a mini snake for my keyboard to their di s i typically used mogami neutrik but need cakes while in the road i usually roll my own to exact length these have worked well quiet no handling noise seem well built i treat cables well so i don t really test them with under tough circumstances and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future they are used nights a week and after uses no problems i recommend them plus for live the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well nice pieces sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried worth the extra give them a try i bought this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp it fits very well and sounds great these have good tone but i can t see much of a difference over other brands at the same price point i initially experienced buzzing after the string change with these but i needed to adjust the truss rod came in a timely manner from sam ash thanks these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex we ve tried d addario brighter sound d addario acoustic guitar strings set exp lite and martin a little stiff martin strings sp phosphor bronze msp in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar the difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nano s have a very light coating that you almost don t feel so if you like standard not coated strings the nano s are probably the way to go if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar for the combination we have these are outstanding strings on the strings lasting longer that s hard to say fresh strings do sound better it s clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non coated strings but i m not certain these last so much longer we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability corrosion or crud on the string isn t the sole factor in changing strings elixir is a wonderful company on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesn t perform up to your standard the other amazing thing i ve watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and i m still very confused the elixir website it s pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes it is so simple and so reproducible i love this technique this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag after experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a stevens steel bar for lap playing and a dunlop glass over the finger slide for spanish style playing i decided to try the dunlop harris tapered brass slide it s probably a personal issue but i much prefer the weight of the brass slide the taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control this slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it the material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses another practical plus for the brass slide is that i don t have to worry about what would happen if i drop it in short it s a winner i decided to try these open metal finger picks when i could no longer find propicks which i really like propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier stiffer metal they offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger i find these and the propicks for that matter much more natural than conventional picks these actually have some advantages over the old propicks you get three finger picks rather than two and because the metal is a heavy gauge they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers it would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they re protected in the guitar case however they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free ranging around in the case highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar this is not a great quality microphone but that s not what i was expecting when i paid for the mic and stand i bought this for my group of kids in a worship school i need some less expensive equipment to play on so it works well for that this is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first i have no regrets all of the positive reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent guitar model are spot on if you re in the market and don t have a grand to spend on a new acoustic guitar get this north american made gem you won t regret it although i purchased a lanikai lu ukulele some time ago i have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours despite that i ve been highly impressed with its quality and sound as some reviewers note nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp however that s more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele the lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range the tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well if i were going to be playing gigs i d probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument and i probably would not purchase it without trying it first but for having some fun this is a workable and recommended instrument i purchased a set of fender vintage tremelo tension springs in order to beef up the tremelo tension on an inexpensive squier jagmaster guitar that i recently purchased these springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the jagmaster the loop actually goes all the way around which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar and it seems that they are of a higher tension highly recommended as replacement springs or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars first i ve noticed that many reviews here are for the original ns tuner the one with only two buttons and coin slot battery cover this one is a little smaller has a metronome flasher and the battery installs differently but the name model evidently didn t change i compared this new one the original and the latest snark on dreadnought guitar mandolin and string banjo pros size size and size reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some cons display not as bright as otherscontrary to their description this one seems less sensitive than original battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks on my wife s a style mandolin it fits but barely on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits that being said i haven t found anything i can t use it on my take the snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy lock in speed and visibility however i really dislike the eyeball on a stick form factor and refuse to use it on stage i like the fact that the ns is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument i even in leave em on in the case the display and lock in speed of the original ns was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me i ll keep the new ns tuners for now and hope that d adarrio or someone improves on it with a better processor and led over the years i ve tried literally dozens of capos while some have been better than others i ve never had one i was completly happy with string buzz hard to place without being out of tune too firm not firm enough etc so far the planet waves ns tri action capo is the best one i ve ever tried at least in the short term it s worked equally well on my acoustic my electric it works on my octave mandolin and even though it s designed for strings on my rickenbacker string hopefully it will give years of faithful service for the quality is reasonably priced at this point i give it thumbs up recommended i completely agree with jpfromoh this planet waves d addario artist capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly the micro adjusting knob for tweaking tension pressure is nice but i ve wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar ukulele that i have a standard tension spring might be a bit too firm but at least it s consistent i also thought i d like the curved cradle for the neck but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele i know i know this isn t designed for ukuleles but i have no such troubles with my kyser capos i don t understand the clip for a tuner on this thing i have several clip on tuners that clip directly to the headstock and most are planet waves already why would i want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when i m using the capo i suppose that if you have money to burn this is a useful addition and the pick holder is a nice touch but i use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me as others have noted there are other better capos out there
352	first of all i use this as more of a band eq using the lower and highest more for lp and hp filters the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders the box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but i tend to set and forget in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that i have been exposed to have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp eq is to enhance your tone not create it a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa your tone is made up of many many variables the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies that is the function of an eq nothing more it can range from dramatic to very subtle very small changes can have large effects small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics i am able to produce i tend to put the eq in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment these microphones were made for the studio i used it for live performance you better have a good pa system to enjoy the sound there everything that the video showed it s a great microphone period top of the line and it works great thank you marshall electronics and amazon i just got it today and haven t spent too much time with it yet it sounded ok and i like the features on it i especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal as soon as you press down it s on lots of adjustments so i ll be tweaking for a while to find my sound but it seems like it s going to be ok it s a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve for the money it s a great pedal what can i say that you haven t already read about this amazing pedal if you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal if your looking to play out with it know that it s cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds have a backup take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal that alone can cause problems as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal it has out muscled my other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard i use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and i never turn it off once we start playing i leave it plugged in on the board all the time i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off i carry a backup pedal i love this pedal just don t ever drop it every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig the behringer preamplifier volume booster pedal is an inexpensive yet quality volume pedal that works great i never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my american standard strat what interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before these are easy to install and simple to use all you need is a mm socket and your are set as others have pointed out these are staggered so there are long ones and short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way it only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove i ve read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but i don t even notice the difference they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected i wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since i have mostly behringer products and am more than satisfied with my other pedals decided to try the co again i am more than satisfied a chorus isn t something you use all the time so i expect this one to give me years of good behringer reliability and service for someone looking for that extra color in your sound try this pedal i think you ll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can t beat the price a great value for your money its pretty delayed and doesn t display the notes for very long but i play in drop g and it gets the job done the construction isn t something i wanna step on but in a bag its better than paying as usual another good piece of equiptmentfrom behringer i not only use it for my guitars but also on my keyboardmakes real good sound very adaptable again will buy more of their products as usual most of my purchases on amazon were quality stuff at good prices very efficient and fast delivery times there are some things in this life that you don t want to have to think about and your tuner is one of them you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board it is true bypass and doesn t add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all your brand preference will guide your decision but don t shy away from this well made piece of equipment i would buy it again it is the dual tone shifter i was looking for variable key capability i haven t seen much more expensive ones with these features a great buy for the money i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome exactly what i was looking for and for the price i can not get a better deal totally satisfied the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cable this pedal is very easy to use retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied this is a very simple product and as others have stated you could probably just diy one pretty easily but for this price why bother under and this thing is as good as ones that range from i don t think the material the time it is going to take for you to make one about mins an hour more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and voila it arrives two days later no fuss no muss assuming you have prime because well who doesn t these days plus this will look good on camera
353	granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power or another isolated power supply but it does provide clean quiet daisy chain power for up to pedals and does so pretty dang great for cheaper is it silent no is it reliable yes would i use it on stage or in the studio yes would i prefer something nicer if weren t an issue yes does this wok great on a budget absolutely if you re tired of using batteries pick this thing up if you re a super quiet signal chain snob save an extra and get the voodoo labs the fulltone full drive is another incarnation of the original fulldrive now with mosfet circuitry available via toggle switch this just makes the pedal even more flexible not to mention boutique quality at a working man s price this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish the volume knob gives you lots of gain the tone knob is a presence control the overdrive knob adjusts the level of overdrive and then there is the boost level yes this is a switch pedal so when you are playing a chunky rhythm you can step on the boost switch for a great lead tone the toggle switch in between the tone and drive knobs affect the pedals tonal character as well as how the knobs affect each other there is comp cut allowing for a cleaner boost fm for flat mids and vintage for a more tubescreamer tone as a bonus the pedal is also capable of running on v power for cleaner headroom which is handy for hum bucker pick ups if you have the scratch and are looking for a perfect od pedal then look at the fulldrive it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board i purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim i was looking at some nicer ones and decided to give it a go for only it came in the mail today and i was surprised that basic ness of the packaging very little instructions at all actually this does not ship with a volt battery and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew corner screws on the back to do so wish there was a plastic back or thumb screw option this pedal is really quiet and not in a good way don t expect to boost your signal level with it with the makeup gain output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down it was about the same volume as the original signal only a little noisier did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain add any noise when off most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on due to the nature of raising the noise floor it also has a substantial treble boost low cut going on even with the sensitivity knob all the way down it kills your low end it is quite bright sounding with that being said it works wonders on single string double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the g b and e strings and makes them sound tight and full it does seem quite durable the case isn t made of cheap plastic which is a good thing though not as rugged as some of the other pedals i would own the switch and inputs seem a little cheap though granted it was a pedal i feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea however for home non daily use i could see it lasting a while the led is really bright almost so bright that when you re looking to adjust the controls it makes it somewhat hard to see what you re doing all in all if you re looking for a cheap compressor to boost your treble strings and give em some extra punch this may be the pedal for you especially if you only have if you re looking for a warm full bodied compressor this is not the choice for you you should really wait and get the mxr dyna comp for just a few bucks more i ve bought a number of these for use on my pedal board they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone recommmended if you don t mind a molded cable sounds great love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks it does not work well with a daisy chain power supply with this set up the second channel will distort a bit forget batteries they last minutes with its own power supply sounds amazing esp when one takes in to consideration the price
354	this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal it s go from light overdrives on channel to heavy drives on boost channel with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound on the other side you can t use boost channel without drive channel one of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the mxr carbon copy delay pedal designed by way huge founder jeorge tripps is a great analog delay for under using bucket brigade circuitry true bypass and a very simple knob interface the carbon copy is a very flexible unit utilizing the modulation switch you can achieve a slight chorusing sound like the flutter from old tape echoes which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot the unit has a small footprint like most mxr pedals so it is very pedal board friendly this is truly a great sounding delay so try one out
355	these are guitar picks and i don t play guitar so i can t say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy it has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something such at the side of back of your instrument so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand i don t know exactly how many it holds and the thickness of the picks makes a difference but i ve crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues easy to take apart to put together to store and pretty stable when in use not the cheapest but worth the money received item when promised fits great for my yamaha acoustic electric but carry with care remember acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped great zipped pockets
356	while i love and trust d addario strings i am subtracting one star because i really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets for my acoustics i do not always change out all the strings at once i think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound anyway these are classic strings that i grew up with but as i get more involved with playing having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated especially if you like to save your single strings for use i have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road i have not had this long enough to know if it will but so far so good
357	used these for years on son s electric guitars no fuss mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall no neck damage to axes mounts well but try to find a stud certainly keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall no complaints if you re going to drill your wall is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers all star reviews on this baby and i agree and i add to that total stars i ve used dunlop jazz iii s for years but always had a problem when it came to a song that required a lot of strumming the dava changes that for me not only does it allow for accurate picking but it also allows you to strum when needed just roll your thumb back a little works great i ve been using this pick for about months now and have not gone back to any of my other picks a definite star for being my favorite new pick you won t be dissapointed i use this cable to run between my pedal board and amp at rehearsals in a small space i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p a the box says they are and maybe there is of wire but the stretch on them is maybe for those unfamiliar with vox s amplug products these things are amazing i m just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the s and they were mostly terrible what vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers which weigh virtually nothing run for hours on aaa batteries and plug directly into the guitar is nothing short of amazing they have incredible amp like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want even through a pair of sony headphones they sound amazing the star of the collection in my opinion is the vox ac amplug which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to top boost overdrive if you haven t played an amplug before the ac one is of the best money you ll ever spend now getting to this specific joe satriani amplug it s impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself fans of joe satriani even casual ones will recognize elements of this sound right away satriani has a very distinctive sound which he crafted over the years using a modified boss ds distortion and more recently his vox satchurator distortion box it s a thick lead tone with a nice sustain and colored with a delay effect both of those elements are present on this signature amplug you have a level control a gain control and a tone control there s also three switch positions off on and fx the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same pros first the price retails at whereas most of the other models are i believe the lead amplug is also and also has a delay feature i think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money but this is admittedly a sort of niche product overall however you have several amplugs to choose from and if you choose this one is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone the tone has a real sweet spot between and that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes while it isn t necessarily and ideal rhythm guitar distortion you can hit rich chords with nice sustain i prefer the tone on the higher gain levels and you can really crank it up if you want to but it sounds great at lower volumes too the delay is also surprisingly good it s probably set to around the milisecond gap which is pretty standard adds a cool echo fullness to your solo progressions much like a classic satriani solo again the overall tone is fantastic with the amount of gain provided you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit though i ve always thought of satch of more a technical melodic guitarist than a metal guitarist cons there are a few things to know about the satriani signature model but i don t think any of them should discourage you from checking it out while the delay is surprisingly good you can t customize it you can t make the repeats shorter or longer and you can t adjust the timing of the repeats keep in mind that this is mostly a practice device for your personal use however and i still enjoy using the delay as for the tone which i mostly discussed as a pro in the paragraph above you should be aware that this is not meant to be a clean signal it is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar but it s mostly distortion or bust the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion i don t doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily the switches and dials may also fail over time but frankly at or it s probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging for it which would lock more people out of the market i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke finally there as an audible hiss noise through your headphones anytime the device is on slightly annoying when you re not playing but i don t notice it at all once i start playing notes the verdict one other dirty little secret to point out about these things in addition to the aux jack which allows you to plug in an mp player and jam along it is possible to use a to adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp pa or anything with speakers you might be surprised how good it sounds as an after note i wrote most of this review playing on my jackson dr which has two seymour duncan humbuckers and it sounded great i later tried it on a gibson les paul which is usually my primary guitar and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers it did not sound as good the distortion was much more fizzy haven t tried it with single coil pickups but i think that it would likely work well with a strat type guitar due to the overall roundness of the tone the amplug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing irrespective of their budget or living situation the satriani model brings its own special character to the series and if you like the tone as much as i do might become an instant favorite i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon this thing is awesome it s so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it oh and it turns itself off after seconds of no sound it does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark but the more i use it the better feel i get for it if you don t have one get one
358	these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently for the more casual player these might not be the best choice for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these d addario strings they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings for the more casual musician somebody that isn t changing their strings once a week these are probably not a great choice personally i use elixir strings on my electric guitars a les paul standard and a gibson lucille i do not play gigs so a set of strings doesn t see an hour or two of really hard playing per night the coating on elixir s helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers i like their feel a bit better than these strings i get about a month of playing from those strings sadly these d addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing i ve tried a variety of strings ernie ball elixir and d addario on my guitars and the way i play the elixir s just sound and play the best to me of course your mileage may vary if i did start to play gigs i would probably switch to a more affordable string like these a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings d addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge i change strings myself and i really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings with the gauge clearly printed on the package if you are new to changing strings or only change them infrequently this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time d addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic i kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started they could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary in the end the silly colored balls at the end of the strings well they look goofy on my guitars i wouldn t mind the colors on an acoustic the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway but those balls are visible on my electric guitar i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings i don t have any problems with this pedal but for the price i would just go with the way huge aqua puss for an analog delay this tuner is wonderful you can tune all strings in same time it s halpfull in stage because you don t need to test each string individually this is by far the best delay effects box i ve ever used and it has so much potential that it ll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers it s also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end it is built like a tank and doesn t take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very user friendly pedal wish all pedals were built this way highly recommended after having collected a few guiters through the years i needed the kind of stand to hold certain ones in particular
359	these aren t my first set i can t count the amount of monster cables i bought and own none has ever failed me so far highly recommend these i love how they sound and they are built well i picked up this pedal used along with ds keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think long story short the mod ds is getting returned and i m keeping my fulltone ocd first a word about the negative reviews it tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something but the other reviews as of sept were all star reviews it tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didn t know what the pedal was before they tried it and anyone complaining about the price this is a hand crafted pedal that is extremely well constructed the inside circuitry is pristine and built to last for decades i think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost now let s talk about how the pedal sounds it s marketed as an overdrive distortion i had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because i indicated i was looking for a distortion pedal but i was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has it is much more an overdrive in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp but boosts the level in gain in a very full rich sound the sound has a lot of bass to it but unlike a tubescreamer ts it s definitely not muddy in fact if you re tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act this might be exactly what you need the battery is accessible behind hand screws and moderately involved to get to but an ac adapter is really the way to go it s a standard plug like you find on boss and ibanez pedals but you can use a v or v i ve read some reviewers say that v gives you more headroom while some actually prefer the v sound honestly i tried both and didn t discern any difference it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinets finally there is an lp hp switch and it s really a matter of preference and setup how you use it i ve been mostly using the lp setting which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that i hate but in a live setting or to use it as a boost for soloing the hp setting could be quite useful as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to cut through the other instruments on stage if i had to summarize this pedal i would describe it as a tubescreamer you can rock with which is not to say that it s better than the tubescreamer necessarily but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your go to for rhythm chord sections soloing or both moen pedals are great nice quality at an unbelievable price point this pedal is no exception it is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch to be fair i have not tried many other vibes hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal that being said i am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere vibe is very trower like think bridge of signs chorus is on the mellower side very analog sounding not digital replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better solid well built and should last i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues my only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect i read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led s would fix the problem and indeed it did it s been fine since despite this needed fix i would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if i needed to such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes worth every penny mind you does require some length and height adjustment for some epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put so far so good i ordered one of these bad boys on a whim it s definitely the best verb it s price range you can dial in some pretty lush tones it has a way toggle that changes it from hall spring and room verbs there d is also an a b switch that is almost a tone mode a is bright and in your face and b is very lush and ambient using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb also has a blend knob which controls wet and dry signal mix and time knob that controls you guessed it reverb time and amount very versatile this pedal is built with great construction though the first one i received was faulty all sorts of popping and weird stuff going on the nd one works flawlessly seems very durable switch and jacks are quality i highly recommend getting a spot or v adapter b c this thing drains batter power fast though all modulation pedals do this pedal does not suck tone and is true bypass though i wish this wasn t as i wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned off for lt shipped i certainly can t complain if you have any hesitations on the biyang stuff i definitely recommend it bucks is better than for the tube screamer from ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube i use this on the clean channel of my bugera v tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should awesome with my ltd vc with and jb pickups this joyo jf crunch distortion pedal is just amazing my son has become a fairly decent guitar player over the past year and is moving beyond the basics so was thrilled to get his hands on this distortion pedal it was great to hear him play iron man through this pedal it made a huge difference the pedal produces a rich sound that has a nice sustain and tweaks easily with the three adjustment knobs gain volume and tone this is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse at the loudest settings there is a bit of hiss but it is easy to find where it starts and dial it back a bit highly recommended cfhevaluation unit provided by manufacturer i really liked this one i bought the crunch distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone i very much like how joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced boutique pedals i will continue to buy these products from joyo until i find something wrong with them and at present i have nothing to bitch about at all here sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound as an example this is the jf and jf on guitar and the jf on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a line spider buy this these pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny love joyo pedals not sure yet on the new line they just dont feel as solid to me that being said the pedal sounds great great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch time will tell this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there i have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedallike many other reviewers my gripe with the new pedals is the switch may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation great price for a carbon copy pedal just buy it you wont regret it it beats spend gobs of cash that you could spend on other things
360	i play in small tight places sometimes people dance right in front of us i actually bought one of these for my partner because for some reason he would put his stand high and only use of his boom to hold his microphone the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently he wouldn t and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancers when i saw this i thought it would make a nice christmas gift he does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reason i bought one for myself as well and i do like it the plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though it comes apart quite easily my only complaint what i do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesn t slip down at all i personally love that because i have had boom arms that go limp and their is nothing more annoying pretty darn good in every way trim and easy to use solid construction i recommend this capo without reservation i like it and it is small i ve been using this product for a while now only for indoor really light use so i can t speak to it s durability at this time but i like it because it s cheap light and it works i was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar these work great and look sweet too their shape keeps your guitar securely in place but is also easy to unhook when your ready high quality product and very easy to install just what i wanted i ve ordered of these and only one has been defective not worth shipping it back no big deal great tuner for my guitar class the snark may have a few more features but if all you need this to do is help you tune you re good to go i have already laid down tracks and the process is effortless easy export to protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo
361	this bag is well padded has backpack straps to carry comfortable and several pockets to hold cable extra strings picks and much much more for the price i feel like it is a steal some people complain about the smell it kind of smells like motor oil it is strange but being i have been around that smell so much it doesn t bother me be warned about it though i don t get any hum and it powers what i need it to a much cheaper route than a dc brick or a pedal power i love pedal trains because they are lightweight come with a case and are easy to work with if pedaltrain asked me my opinion i would say that they needed to raise the back up about to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use but other than that its a pedaltrain nuff said
362	watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the yeti microphone works like a champ gets rid of all those unwanted noises larger than i expected fits just fine i have two electric guitars and one bass nothing can take it down you will see it recommended i use this with my small mobile dj setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all works great and to me its cheap cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable highly recomended so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it i ve used this in my jam lab for years and use it every time i play electric about hours a week the unit itself has held up well no problems with case or pedals all switches knobs plugs display work fine it doesn t have a on off switch but that s minor it s low profile and is easy to switch by foot i have it going into my mixer which works fine no feedback or buzz from it i like the recording software cubase that came with it i didn t think i d use it much but i do it s fun and easy to record my own songs cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close but i ve learned nothing happens and it s fine i don t use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man which if you don t have you need it the drum presets are fun to use it s a blast to set a drum track loop a rhythm then jam on top of it isn t that what it s all about my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn t some flaw i guess also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak i don t like them at all the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone they rock i use alot of the other ones as well imho this the must have addition to your set up it s not for professional use but when i turn pro i ll get something better the latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device i ve yet found the blue microphones yeti usb microphone long known for their line of high end condenser microphones blue is increasingly known for their computer ready usb microphones like the snowflake and the snowball and the yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer ready microphone yet advertised as the first fully thx compliant a standard devised by lucasfilms microphone the yeti is a large tall on its removable stand hefty multi pattern microphone suitable for recording podcasting or any other computer related audio activity it features four switchable patterns omni carodid figure eight and stereo a built in headphone amplifier gain control headpohone volume and a mute button for even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard microphone stand or boom and it sounds great too even better than their well regarded snowball series i ve been using it for recording music practice building tracks with audacity on my windows and linux boxes and with apple s garageband and making calls with skype the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus up to now i ve been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an a d converters a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home the yeti has it all in one package it may not sound quite as good as a multi thousand dollar condenser microphone and vacuum tube preamp but for the money it simply can t be beat
363	the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap sm wannabe from radio shack i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then i can easily position for use with a generous inch reach definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient just what i needed i ve uploaded customer supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is when you factor in the price it s plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain but a flexible platform for mounting components one other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table top only rack they work very well on the floor the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank i have a bass amp head and a power amp plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that combined weighs around pounds the rack is not stressed or strained by this weight and could probably hold another pounds safely and reliably another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components eliminating that expense i was expecting to have to orderraxxess rack screws with washers hardware pack of which turned out to be completely unnecessary my only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem if you need portability reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved such as setting up on stages this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment i am so pleased with mine that i intend to purchase another one bringing the total to three great price but unfortunately this product didn t work for me fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i m happy with the results having purchased many a frame and more traditional style stands this one has quickly become my favorite not only is the padding much better than the rest of them this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work only thing lacking a bit is the instructions but it s easy enough to put together that they aren t really needed i ll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon i have a small format channel mixer for my acoustic and small gigs and it has no built in effects it also gets a little bit noisy when using the eq on the two mic pre channels the mic mechanic allows me to dial in foot switchable effects right on y pedalboard where they should be for a solo act or when your running your own sound i typically leave the tone button on at all times as it gives a nice eq curve and mild compression effects are easy dial up on the selector and can be customized by using the modifiers read the manual the correction works pretty well for me but someone who is a bett vocalist may not need it in which case you can turn it down i typically run mine around e thing i don t like about this pedal is its v power consumption it can be phantom powered but if i engage phantom power on my mixer it is on for both mic pres and i use the other often times for a second dynamic mic when playing as a duo it can run off the sanyo pedal power without issue however and i often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delay reverb for my guitar
364	if you go very high with the boost in frequencies you will get noise in significant quantities too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation pay the extra money and get something quiet others complained about this and they were right if you want to experiment with equalization its good and cheap some complained about each band boosting others this is more of a user problem than manufacturing if you want to isolate a frequency range boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you ll get a narrow range in this respect its like an mxr band these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure i used to use the tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these i ended up using that pick for something like years playing times wk once i started playing hrs wk at my church i decided that this pick had proven its self so i order a small box i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one fyi i generally don t play hard and i always play acoustic nanoweb custom lights if you like thick heavy gauge picks but find they wear too fast for you this is the pick for you they have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff but also wear as in don t wear down like nothing else these were a very nice find
365	arrived on time packaged well happy with purchase they are your regular picks will order again if needed happy with purchase hope you enjoy em i ve tried to like this pedal i really have maybe it s my signal chain my experience with the digitech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar sure the od is there but it isn t worth losing your tone is it again i reiterate maybe it s just me i have been messing around with signal chains for almost decades now and the blue pedal isn t any different either imo grunge was ok but not my kind of style i didn t know how pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps i was origianlly disappointed in the sound you won t get ac tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your amp sorta like buying a wah flanger or other product this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone problem is is that you won t replicate a vox sound found on a classic rock album because what you are producing is a unique sound i have yet to try this through a loop
366	i am glad i bought this it is exactly what was described and it was a good price get it has a nice smell works like a charm this bottle will probably last me years good cheap price a recommended purchase if was looking to get my amps off the flood i have w amps and a big fender dsp i am using this for my amps it works very well i recommend them to do the job for the i am not sure i would use them for a sunn v x cabinet i wasn t sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since i was just starting out i bought this to work with rocksmith and it did the job just fine the guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible it turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage i put new strings on it and fixed the intonation adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar and it sounded a lot better unfortunately there s no nd fret on this guitar that probably shouldn t come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have frets but there s this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the nd fret the single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn t pick up much of that hum or else you resort to using the nd and th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum i think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too i haven t gotten that far yet i ve had it since february changed strings on it twice in months and so far it s proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on except for that nd fret oh well i ve had a few of these things not all the same model this one was hard to read i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal
367	i ve used the mm and mm dunlop nylon picks during my entire professional music career i rock hard acoustic electric and bass i ve tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily dunlop s nylon picks don t break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs you ll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip i rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming maybe times in my entire career buy these picks these just happen to be my favorite i always keep mm mm and mm sizes on hand mostly use the s i ve been using them for years and so will probably never change i like the grippiness of them i hate smooth picks picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like fantastic strap nope it isn t leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff but it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my cc ot banjo that has a really tight spacing all the others i tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass once again extremely comfortable and sturdy so had to buy another so i can just have one on each i just received the case today the soonest delivery day on the estimation range a plus there now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim threading and basic locks keys included are gold toned instead of silver toned pictured but that doesn t mean diddly squat to me plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck i am primarily a string banjo player but decided to casually play around with the mandolin and so i figured i had better get a hard case for possible long time storage my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before i started getting serious with it and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces this case will definitely do the trick excellent value additional note there is a bit of extra play around the peg head i have an rover mandolin i can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough some peg snapping may occur but again for simple storage protection its a non issue scratch free durable machine washable i use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much much longer you place the cloth next to a string then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces sides and top of the string then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times then repeat on the remaining strings i then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys takes a matter of moments and works great then once every week or two it just goes in with the laundry comes out perfectly clean again polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric it is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface but it works well for polishing if i m using carnuba wax i use a cotton towel to remove it but for dry polishing wouldn t be without one for each guitar it is a guitar stand does what it is built to do good buy for the cost i would purchase again just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned the thumbpicks both came in medium which at the time i didn t pay any attention to however after about weeks of using them and the fingerpicks on my banjo i came to the conclusion that i needed a large size for my thumb the mediums sat a little too high up my thumbnail for comfort i suppose you could put them in hot water to stretch them out as i have read but regardless for a quick n dirty set for someone just starting out its just the ticket without having to buy a bunch of sets of to figure out what is comfortable with price assortment in mind i give stars this is a great tuner high quality construction the tuning is accurate the controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read it is far superior to a fishman tuner that i bought previously the fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate these tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing
368	another quality product from hosa just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq i always like slightly longer length as i can always zip tie back but hard to stretch no noise from this cable i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine there doesn t seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last they do what they re supposed to do i can t believe i m giving a star review to a behringer product but they got these right i replaced a way more expensive audix condenser mic with these and they actually sound pretty darned good if i crunch one or if one breaks i ll just get more at this price i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck these are totally fine having feet of xlr xlr m f cables that can be used any way i want e g ea foot for stereo foot for mono or ea foot for multichannel work is very flexible the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord white to store them when not in use as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job i ended up using all of the cords for mics and amplified speakers plus another of their foot cables for interconnect you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch the soundis full and fills the room
369	the dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition and looking great it also had two soft cloths that are needed for application removing excess and polishing i couldn t be happier it fits nice an tight on mic stand you can get around ten picks in it so it s a good product this is a fine stand for the price but i was honestly surprised at how light it is i honestly think on stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price i do use this stand but i wish i would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future it works fine just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past what more can i say these strings sound great they play wonderfully work well together have a nice brilliant but not tinny sound and are excellently made these are not going to unwind on you or break easily excellent that s all there is to say about it i have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard i wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time so i tried this cable and it works perfectly very heavy cord and top quality construction can t beat the price either will buy again the stand seems sturdy the base is like a tripod base of a mic stand so it may hold up better in the long run than my other stands that have the clamping type of base the top of the stand is shorter than my others not really a problem but worth mentioning the only gripe i could have with the stand is that the top takes two screws and two wingnuts so it is not practical to use for gigging setting up tearing down i will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows for the price very sturdy and seems to be nice quality
370	i have been using these for months now with string bass i think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar as i often find myself playing with fingers then suddenly a pick song starts and where s a pick i usually have to offset it and with the tuner placement i can only fit one pick but i still find them indispensable and no tape or other sticky stuff there is also a model made specially for bass updated i now have the bass model on all of my basses it is definitely better for thicker strings the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer i do love it but the spreading strings on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect so still highly recommended if your headstock has a straight through design not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock they should make a metal edition for that slap these puppies on your ten dollar squier and you ve got yourself a guitar i d describe the sound as a bit metallic ish definitely a sharper tone i use mediums but bought these for my nephews takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar always love these strings this kid has not changed his strings in years so i thought i would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible there are two ways guitar strings go bad if you leave them on long enough the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode but that takes months if not more before that happens grease from your fingers dust bits of skin and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings between the windings this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound back when strings were a lot more expensive some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them some bass players still do coated strings are a simpler alternative these strings and similar ones like elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings which accomplishes two things first it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap which prevents rust and corrosion second it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings they do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings but it s not a huge difference and after a month or two they still sound the same they also cost about twice as much as equivalent non coated d addarios are they worth it that depends if you re an active performer maybe you re probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you re getting a bright sound you re probably also buying your strings by the box there s no real benefit to these strings where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy these days i m strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year i have four acoustic guitars and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played with coated strings i can leave a set on a guitar and a month or two later i can pull it out of the case and it s ready to play i still change strings if i m going to be playing in public but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house these are great firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick they are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold i can play all night without dropping it i really like these strings good sound and the feel is good not sure there is much difference in tension of lighter strings however i only bought one set not three sets and have not had to change them yet after three months i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f and they look stunning the tone seems slightly brighter however i go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference i am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings since they are replacing plastic pins i am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective sounds good these pins are a little thin small so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing if you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins this may not be necessary however even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole the string should go all the way through the hole into the body of the guitar insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches if possible it should be listing toward the neck then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin the pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole if you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you re trying to get your guitar in tune typically ruining a brand new string in the process if you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body correctly or hanging on the pin incorrectly also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation these fit my guitar snugly but not tightly however i do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that i do a lot of string bending a whole step or more sometimes using two fingers strength to bend that far overall i am quite pleased with these this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice so please buy it if you want works and it is good no problem very standard one all your own preferences so you need to try it out before you say if that works for you the standard for mild non oily instrument cleaners leaves no residue easy on old guitars finishes i have used it for years i purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing s still kickin not planning on replacing it anytime soon once i got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel action was fine for me out of the box most definitely one of the best bang for your buck acoustic guitars i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp this runs from my guitar to the pedal works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal this is actually my best cable and i think i will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these decent quality for the price fits the acoustic guitar as intended and seems comfortable to the person it was purchased for nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks i have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for years i can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the james river i used to take my ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing the ibanez is heavy where this rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money i want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere i go when it dies i will buy another one you cannot use this for performance of any kind but for yourself friends and family around the campsite or wherever it is perfect good quality plastic and attractive and cheap replacement for any acoustic guitar slotted with taper and fits well in my bridges this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than day after it had arrived the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made i do not recommend this product
371	this pedal is a must have for any pedal board i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best i have a fender hod rod deluxe and though it s got the formel electronics mod still needed a nice touch this guy filled the need using the effects loop no need of volume or gain the sound is way much richer and definition for different types of guitars is beautiful it works great for five of my lower power pedal type items including my line wireless receivers shure wireless receivers and several other pedals like my cry baby etc all at once however the transmitter for my shure wireless in ear monitor which requires less power than any of the other two items combined will not run even by itself when powered by the spot switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own and there is probably some little quirk in the shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn t get along with for most of my stuff it works great and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords works great very good feel we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetmy wife loves it if i needed two i would buy another this pedal adds that i don t know what to your sound i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal what a difference if you have great top quality cable quiet amps and pedal boards shielded guitars fresh tubes you know the drill you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head then you plug one pedal in and whamo there it is it was this pedal for me just turn the knobs until it comes out of your speakers a must have especially if you are playing clubs bars or arenas you have a pedal board and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front give your notes clarity during leads make overdriven chords ring i like this pedal it s on my board and it s never coming off i love pedal trains because they are lightweight come with a case and are easy to work with if pedaltrain asked me my opinion i would say that they needed to raise the back up about to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use but other than that its a pedaltrain nuff said if you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps easy to use and very secure no fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor i ve owned many tuners through the years and i keep coming back to this one buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point this is the godzilla of volume pedals it is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it it appears to be indestructible i like that it has a tuner output and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver when a friend offered to sell his for bucks i bought it without hesitation i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results if you need light maybe keep looking if you don t mind the heft you will be pleased what a fantastic product i believe i have been wishing for this for years only one problem make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot no longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal board i have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is t u f f i you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product still holding strong building another board and using this stuff it s much better than regular velcro i don t have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after for the price and product quality you can t go wrong with this one and the functionality is great use it as a fuzz distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic jimi hendrix like tones and harmonics
372	bought one of these yrs ago used and it died a couple years back this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever smooth tone the right amount of gain perfect to push a tube amp plus there are now dozens of diy or pro mods available which add a lot more potential recommended i ve played the guitar for a number of years some of them professionally and during that time i ve owned guitars by fender gibson ovation b c rich yamaha and applause that said admittedly this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap expendable guitar that was reasonably playable that i could take with me when i go camping while my expectations weren t all that high due to guitar s price upon reading other reviews and having experienced takamine s quality i decided to gave this jasmine a try i m glad i did what a nice guitar it turned out to be out of the box the fit and matte finish were impressive the neck action was nicely set up the intonation is spot on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone the tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely note that i changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos the jasmine s c nex is truly an impressive guitar for the price if you re a metalhead stay away i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g blows it out of the water this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion it s great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch but if you demand metal get far away i love this guitar it has a terrific sound and it s gorgeous the gig bag although not padded works very well and is well made the pockets are very handy all in all one of the best purchases i ve made for the money very happy
373	i ve had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos what the hell anyway this capo works well i ve only used it on gibson and fender electrics and it does a fine job some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off but it does not affect the capo abilities i m sure there are better ones but for me this works well good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by over the months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house the guitar could take that head dive of death while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse my advice unless you plan to sit and play which you wont really need a strap anyways the whole time spend alittle more to get a leather strap spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play this is a good pedal overall rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so i took the chance and i m pleased as some have said the low range has quite a steep slope to it uncomfortable foot angle but it s a big pedal and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so i can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth i wish the ts jacks were top bottom instead of side by side seems it would take right angle connectors better one gets in the way of the other or even better if it were a trs jack so you d only need one input i might modify it for that a friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord lol the cord delivers good sound quality the only problem i have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy
374	the only reason i give stars is because i ordered of these and had the chord with it and one was missing the chord i ordered both at the same time other than that they are good hot mics this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries we ve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it we are using an mp player for backup the sound is not quite as clear as we get with our roland cm so only stars from me the micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it s nice not to have to load up cart to roll around guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects i was really surprised to see how well they sounded i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route if you just want to play around a little this uke will do this is a very reasonable price for this bag i got it for my les paul epiphone uke the fit is fine this bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke i ll just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesn t have one this stand is small compact and sturdy it holds my tenor uke just fine and when folded fits into the pocket of my uke case it s perfect to take along to a gig or practice and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down
375	not onlh are these good for the price but they have become my new fave i switch acoustic strings times a month on my main guitars i gig times a month these last long without compromising the tone great price too i tried every brand until i got to these not sure why i did not try them earlier probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide after having played the yamaha ypg key portable grand piano keyboard in a showroom and loving it i was torn wondering what all i would be missing out on if i went with the more economically priced ypg i now own the and it appears as if i am missing out on twelve keys that is i am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer s remorse after opting for the cheaper this is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than i will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality of course my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as i will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited as such it might be best to say that for a novice one could not ask for a better instrument for the price so what is the difference between the and the based on my previous comparative shopping i have come up with a few differences first is the obvious fact that the possesses keys while the has the also includes a stand sustain pedal and power adapter which must be purchased separately for the while i am unaware of the specifics the also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices beyond these definitive differences having now played both models the also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly why buy the ypg if price is not an issue go ahead and get he it is a beautiful instrument however for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need keys purchase the like the the possesses piano style graded soft touch gst keys which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted the feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability the like the also features usb connectivity and general midi compatibility as well as almost all of the same high quality voices which separate both the and the from many other models in their price brackets besides the pianos the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic while it is unfortunate that yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the theyamaha survival kit d accessory kit for yamaha ypg ypg keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor extended warranty and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply in my opinion the ypg offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck again the sounds great feels great and is hard to beat for the price works great and does a good job a must have type tool for the price get one light takes up little space and easy to use ive used this on guitars acoustic and electric ukuleles banjos banjo ukeleles violins and mandolins no issues well except that sometimes it rattles quietly it doesn t effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar that just means i take it off most of the time after i tune that s not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time and i hate how that looks anyway i love the little thing my only complaint is that like all other clip on tuners that i ve had it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally and will then wear out the battery
376	i bought this specifically for a gt it fits snuggly almost like it was designed for it there is enough room in the front pocket for the power supply input and output cables and maybe a little more i was also able to put a binder in on top of the gt which sort of protects the screens and knobs a bit more and provides a place for the stupid lead sheet binder than never fits in my other cases this bag is a good size as just an accessory bag to carry along with a guitar and a combo amp if you have a couple pedals and cables or some odds and ends you want to bring along pros looks like the same basic quality as my other gator bags gt fits like a snug glove with just a little use it will be perfect front pocket reasonable pricecons they cost reduced their logo from a thread stiched logo to a cheap vinyl like silk screen or iron on patch unlike product photo and it doesn t match all my other gator bags not a big deal but worth mention other similar gator bags i own have a wrap around padded handle that velcros the two handles together once the bag is closed this does not overall good product but would have liked that other padded wrap around handle and the non cost reduced logo summaryacoustic sounds ok but noisy in weird ways i returned it price seems high for what it is and vs alternatives in the marketplace pros boss case is metal mechanical design is durable standard v power and the power jack is on the back where it belongs variety of acoustic sounds possible personally i only thought of them sounded realistic at all though cons fizzy noise integrated with notes played or chords generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain while i have several boss pedals i think they always make the knobs too small and the font print too small i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing details the basic concept is good i had an ac prior model and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note it wasn t in between the notes or when not playing it was integrated with the sound of every note you played or chord and you could not filter it it was also just noisy in the pedal chain adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some however i sold that model because i didn t want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn t happy with the sound at the time the ac s were selling for about new boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac i bought the ac hoping they had improved the issues of the ac and they did a little but not enough to keep it i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues just not as pronounced i think the ac could work for gigging but there are other choices that sound as good for instead of to with tax and or shipping so to me the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead they make two a and a the has reverb on the pedal i opted for the and got it for i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case however this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy or or behringers for the price of a boss if it breaks i ll just buy another i also have a boss gt multi effects unit you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that out of the behringer or out of the boss ac the least cost effective of those choices is the ac and it has noise issues the other two don t have i m not saying its a bad pedal i m just saying it wasn t the best choice for me when considering the cost the sounds and my usage model if they would fix the noise issues i might have even kept it i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i m using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect this boss pedal just didn t work that well for me i had fairly low expectation for a pedal but many people said it sounded very close if not better than a vintage boss vb considering i didn t want to spend x this pedal i can t compare the but can say it works very well it can do subtle low rate low depth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles the rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control or at least turning it up weakens the effect which i guess is good i might swap around the leads finally a non blue led is used which means it won t blind you when you try to adjust the settings being however the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even behringer s pedal and the hinge is a little less stable it will still hold up with moderate use however it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature which is a momentary mode why not for the price and some reviews i found online i had to try this pedal i bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since i ve bought it note i recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and i ve found that it does two things the vibe sound doesn t get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and any volume drop you might experience having this after some od distortion seems to be less i suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you for me it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this mine is musicman this is the pedal after pedals but you ll get a good idea of the general settings i use it on summaryat it is a great size and ok quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig other options are available slightly longer and also with a nd compartment inside no padding or impact resistance is provided but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle also available longer or with chambered configuration on different models pros good size for speaker stands mic stands guitar stands music stands other than the top shelf and other what not you may want to cram in there depending on your style affordable at availalbe on prime shippingcons this model is one compartment for speaker stands you may want a compartment model lack of any impact resistance the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas it would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands detailsin one of my bags i was able to put folding mic stands music stand other than the top piece with the shelf that does not fit even if the bag was empty folding guitar stands and still had room for some more if i wanted to put more in bag was getting kind of heavy at that point in a sconed i was able to put on stage stands oss ss b speaker stands they fit with extra room on the ends in this bag there is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands i am considering exchanging this one for a section bag so the speaker stands are separated but probably will just keep this one the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas and a zipper and handles when laying empty it is long x about wide and lays flat seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around but for serves a basic purpose with affordability these are a direct drop in replacement on fender standard mim stratocasters fender american standard fender american deluxe i have replaced my tuners of this style with fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back unfortunately the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish but you can get them ultimately i ordered a set of these non locking ones the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender s schaller s gold hardware not all gold hardware is the same color gold the quality is good and they look and function well however i returned them because they are not locking i ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar i was building if you just want gold tuners don t care about the string locking feature and are playing a fender strat or tele you can t beat these by comparison to a lot of the gold tuners the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too this pedal is ok by which i mean i provides the basic functions it says it does quality wise it feels a bit cheapish i was afraid i was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it the case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from the power switch and chorus vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find and are not that easily accessible by a toe you gotta bend over and flip those they are small on the other hand it was only sixty nine bucks relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedal i don t care for the rear facing upwardly angled input output and power jacks that s not pedal board friendly in my opinion nice as a tabletop effect the footprint is fairly huge on the board at about x approx the standard v center negative power supply is a postive excuse my pun if you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation echos vibratos reverbs old style choruses this is not a bad way to get started playing with that you can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank personally i have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space so for me not a keeper your situation might be different than mine not a bad product acceptable at it s price point just didn t impress me much i love this stomp box although i never stomp on it needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you my amplifier doesn t have reverb so i route the effects send to it and leave it on it has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldn t think about playing without it
377	this is a fine guitar but it isn t amazing my particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear coat there s one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick guard mounts to the underside of the body neither would be apparent to someone who wasn t appraising the guitar but they are there and don t look normal to me maybe i got the first one off the line after they switched from black painted models my guitar also has a weird v shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn t match at all i m guessing that it s a joint that has been glued together i know that the better les paul guitars have a one piece neck and since i didn t read about this one having something different i assumed it would be the same glue is stronger than wood and les paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area so i guess my guitar should be more durable than some still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery i m not sure that seeing these finish issues before hand would ve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar but upon reflection it would ve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying my remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all les paul guitars versus my particular instrument the guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap even while sitting the top strap peg is angled up slightly where guitars with horns have them angled down which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a les paul the pegs just don t stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars it s great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that real les paul guitars do but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup the range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small and i found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated strings without additional hardware the guitar sounds decent it looks pretty great although not quite as pretty as the pictured one and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars note the shorter scale length is characteristic of les paul guitars it doesn t indicate that this is less than a full sized guitar though this is a fine guitar for the price i m not sure that i would make the same choice if i were in the same position again i m in love with the dual design system it works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly there is one downside to this system as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap there was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time one component which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren t much help either the directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go but i didn t know the name of the piece nor could i readily find it in there after that i installed this into my new guitar and strap and i was ready to go i highly recommend this it is much easily to switch out straps w o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process i have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is great as a matter of fact i ordered more get this one and have no regrets bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding and to have the padded area longer these strings are really nice they have a great tone decent longevity and the trademark ernie ball feel some reviewers have stated that the strings have a silky feel even comparing them to coated strings but i don t find that to be the case they feel pretty much like any other guitar string albeit much gentler than stainless strings if money were no option i d probably move to these exclusively but at roughly three times the price of good to great nickel strings i m not sure that they are good enough to justify the massive price premium each string did come inside its own protective sleeve which made restringing easier and is a feature that i absolutely expect from a premium string
378	i ve been using these strings for about eight years and i also use them on my two taylor s ce i use the mediums on my i agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there i still use martin strings once in awhile but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them actually i own three other acoustics other than my two taylor s and right now they re all strung with exp s i know people want different sounds from their strings but i find these to be bright with a great bottom on them unlike the elixirs which i find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end these strings sound great with great dynamics on them even on my laguna grand symphony slightly larger than a grand concert they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs these on my grand auditorium do the same thing they produce the sound i demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings i ve used the mediums on my have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mid s and treble as i said i still use martin phosphor bronze strings once in awhile but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great darn near as near to an uncoated string that you re going to find my kids were excited to split this pack of picks since there were two of each in the pack they didn t have to argue over who got which pick these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing i think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the s and s i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo these may be my new favorite bass strings likes bright i d call them very bright except they don t seem to have the harsh twangy tone i d expect they seem bright yet still soft clear the lows sound present and clear consistent flex once i had these on for a couple of days the tuning seemed very stable the tone seems to sharpen less when they are played hard compared to my last strings d addario brand to me these guys have a long history of making excellent strings playability these feel pretty supple and effortless to work with price i feel like i should be paying more for these strings technology new design textured round this is a round wound string with a hex shaped core overall love these especially for the price d addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around i ve used their strings for electric acoustic bass electric and acoustic guitar irish bazouki mandolin irish tenor banjo string banjo even used their octave mandolin strings on my serbian brach always with stellar results when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldn t be hype i was right i strung my guitar with these about weeks ago have probably played the guitar or so hours at gigs and in the studio i ve never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of minute sets but these did and i was sober so it wasn t just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when i played it of course that wouldn t mean a thing if they didn t feel good on the fingers they do like they were custom made for your guitar they were on my rickenbacker so i can t honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but i strongly suspect they would not only do they stay in tune but weeks later they still sound crisp new i m going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good i usually change my strings every other week when i m playing regularly so i m already passed my regular limit i may update this review in a month or so when i know how long they lasted most highly recommended
379	if you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks i said good not loud loud enough yes i suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time this is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased great color and retro style as well i ve gotten a number of these joyo and artec pedals now most from earth city sound tx mostly on ebay these days though i recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don t happen to know much about them otherwise i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay i ve had the digitech x series multi delay for many years the fun thing this joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy ufo sci fi ish sounds all one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs guitarists who are fans of yo la tengo and similar groups spacey stuff will dig this box solid hardware side mount ac power goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now they ve updated it s look great clone of a much more expensive crunch box pedal true bypass knobs and switch are sturdy great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels this is a marshall type distortion more mids less scooped no brutalzzz there are better pedals to cop the scooped or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing but you can get close with the right amp eq and this thing dimed i agree with another reviewer this thing has a very high output so be forewarned the first time you plug in unity is around o clock on the level knob it gets thumbs up for the sound price ratio if you don t mind a longer shipping time these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web this was my fourth joyo pedal and i believe joyo and the dano cool cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of price quality years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless this pedal solved my problem with my amp after years of messing about with my mesa boogie realizing the the california sound is not what i truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a marshall or vox this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a marshall or vox one can say all kinds of things about quality but for it made me even more versatile it needs to be in front of a tube amp i like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments i run this through a furman pedal board and there is little to no noise for the money this is a good product
380	guitar picks make a huge part of your tone especially on acoustic these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion they have a long life and do brighten your tone freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape you can t go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick they have a better grip and a more full sound to my ears over the tortex picks i have since went to the jazz picks but these picks are a solid product i should ve just got this cable the first time i have been using monster for years i recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way i ve been hooked on d addarios for quite a while the per unit price on these is great and i never worry about breaking one of these great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it very sheep relatives with the quantity if you expect to get what you pay for prepare to be disappointed sounds weak sounds old sounds worn sounds dull i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster i can afford to pay twice as much but i am going to keep using my d adario strings from now on i am so disappointed these strings are for the campfire guitarist not the aggressive picking thrilling tapping pull offs or sweepers if you are a tone fanatic keep looking if your guitar deserves the best do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings respect your guitar i wouldn t be surprised if they are made from china working great on my stratocaster excellent purchase feels good to switch positions solid and quiet i should ve bought this to replace the original switch from the start they have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better and they give u some spares al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto y con una buen duravilidad hoy lo instalare saludos desde venezuela bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat doesn t fit perfect kinda bummed but oh well i purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though i make every effort to avoid them and to protect the side where i rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time i ve used carnuba car wax many years ago and this is a much higher grade easier to apply easy to remove there were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that i did not notice at first and i was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface they were very minor and did not affect the wood but this will seal them not a sufficient defect to return the instrument another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal i have open tuning machines and before applying tri flow with a pinpoint applicator i used this wax let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel the chrome is gleaming they re really beautiful did a great job on the headstock as well with mop and abalone inlay when the strings were removed also got the tuning pegs this is a om acoustic only way i can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge i used distilled water so if someone left too much water possibly a problem but all worked fine for me dr duck s ax wax works great on all of my guitars including my nitro finished ones can be hard to remove if you use too much so apply only a few drops at a time nice picks a bit small for my preference great for picking kind of harsh for strumming quality seems top notch some guitarists will love these nice grip sound articulate durable nice i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite i bought gauges both are going to be used for years most the reverb selection sound identical they all sound good i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better i use this pedal in my pedal chain it doesn t get much action my amp has a reverb i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar
381	fits very well on my les paul this pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from from subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only and it s built tough like a good effects pedal should be full metal case and solid construction an all around great buy i have yet to install this neck but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect there is little to no evidence of corners being cut just to start materials and labor all look good to great measuring for fit and specifications is on the money not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most econo necks seem to be off by at least i d rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re drill frets look good and nut looks good until i can install it i can only really vouch for stars long story short is this neck looks better than many i ve had that cost x as much or more unless it has a twist or hump it actually earns the th star even if the frets need a little cleanup it still earns the th star while some may not like the flatter radius i d argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren t as much of an issue and it is clearcoated maybe not a nice amber finish but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all so again another reason for the th star
382	i love this thing action is perfect great sound good feel easy to play i highly recomend this if you re looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case this is it for the price it has better padding than i expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps good deal for the price i ve used several different kinds of strings over several years playing i m no expert but these strings sound good to me subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing if you havent tried em they re worth a shot clean and clear sound great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking i prefer a string with a little more volume they tune well and hold a tune well when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psu sb otherwise the time machine works fine as described i bought this as a second tuner for gigs it is awesome easy to use easy to see simple inexpensive get one you will not be disappointed
383	these strings have great tone and feel they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal especially a delay for this price but i figured how can you go wrong if it s not good at least you re not out a lot of money i ve been thoroughly impressed with this pedal much more sturdy than it appears in photos i actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it works great so far and don t regret purchasing worth every dime where else can you get a great functioning delay pedal for this price let me just start out by saying that i ve been playing guitar for over years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time i still own most of these units except for this one the joyo compressor my setup is a very simple one starting with a stratocaster to compressor wah wah super overdrive boost pedal delay then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb vibrato i don t want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i ve tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them this thing simply didn t work right out of the box while the outside of this stomp box is all metal the inside is full of very low grade parts from china loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board i ended up sending it back for a full refund i don t in anyway blame the seller they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again just nothing with the name joyo on it if you re only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware you get what you pay for
384	there s a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these and if it doesn t it should this is a great all purpose dynamic mic i use it for instruments vocals even field recording sometimes the sm has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals but that doesn t mean that the can t handle a voice they re pretty much the same mic as far as i m concerned and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner i think you ll find the same thing and if you re operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably then you probably already know what you re looking for i ll be getting a to add to my personal cabinet soon but if you re like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics you can t go wrong here i always purchase grovers for my guitar straps but my gibson les paul standard plus had a bigger strap knob so i bought this dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly a good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system the best strings i ever bought and i ve bought them all i got these for my electric and the ej p acoustic electric for my acoustic they have a really full sound bright highs and they bend like crazy it s odd to review such a simple thing as screws what can i say they re shiny and screwed well into the holes i love this thing it quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument i own electric acoustic guitars electric acoustic bass guitars it clips on securely is easy to see stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on off from the front you can barely notice it at all i just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed when i switch to another instrument i un clip it and take it with me to what ever i want to play next i love this thing love it love it love it
385	i always played with the brown colored s growing up but i love the blue finish on these i d recommend the fender picks over any others personally but i m very partial to blue as well so these are perfect i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar i did see this device on amazon com and i decide to buy and try one i was pleasantly surprised with this guitar quick release system is working good with my acoustic guitar and because of that i did purchase more for my other guitar and for my friend one easy to take apart to put together to store and pretty stable when in use not the cheapest but worth the money this came in the mail today in a rather large box the blue led light is fine you can put about medium picks in the pick holder more than enough to keep me and a friend in picks for a few songs it is not bad but i don t think i would purchase another one the picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well i have not had them very long but seem to do well
386	i used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night i typically practice sitting down without a strap when i am alone but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band i had previously used a very expensive padded leather cradle type strap which i really liked i sold that banjo and the strap with it but recently re acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap but was not willing to pay the again for a premium padded leather strap i saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance i am glad i did this strap may not be as elegant as fine leather but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction what blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo which weighs about pounds literally felt half as heavy it is no joke at first the feeling was unnerving because the strap has some elastic give to it you get this dual sensation of a the banjo feeling super light and b as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor paradoxical i know but that s where the magic of this strap is it is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you but in reality it remains very stable when playing like i said the build quality is outstanding my only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non traditional so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument like a string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap this is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point i think i might try these on my electrics though i already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps i started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in december of and continue to do so to this very day he absolutely swears by them he does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in hawaii makes them prone to rusting other than that the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality he highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there it s perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use we use these at my church and they get moved around a little bit but not much for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine of stands in this price range this is at the top of what i ve experienced it s easily adjustable the screws stay tight once adjustments are made it s light but not so light that it tips or blows over the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling seriously for those who don t need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around this is the one to go with if you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and or going on tour shipping around in airplanes or vans etc you will need to go up a notch or two in quality and sadly price one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs they can be configured as a master slave set up with a single link cable a inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per cm in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient the low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ i have run both aroland rd nx digital pianoandroland v combo vr the grand piano setting on the rd nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the b emulation from the v combo i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand s down bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances i use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you however once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument s volume and eq controls there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand first the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm to the floor not exceed inches i agree this may be relatively small but it s heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high it s easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended i ve owned a couple of pedaltrain pedal boards first the pt and now the pro i use this to house a line m m a korg pitchblack tuner clyde deluxe wah and a boss channel switch there s plenty of pedal board real estate for all of this and the soft case is incredibly strong and durable you can imagine my board being very heavy and it is but the soft case does a great job the included velcro keeps the incredibly heavy m and m securely in place even when i store the pedal board upright on edge between weekly gigs there s also a lot of places to use zip ties to clean up your rig also comes with a great little bracket that will house the voodoo lab and possibly some other pedal power supplies pedaltrain makes a great pedal board the reason i stopped using amp stands was because i couldn t find anything collapsible and non bulky it works very well and is very sturdy i use it for a hot rod deluxe ok i like this one a lot it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime it is accurate easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing it sure beats the other units i have used where you clamp on some weird thing tune up and then stash back in your gig bag this one is bing on tune and back to playing it weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up
387	really perfect as advertised experienced player might have other choices but for me it was easy to use and exactly met its purpose my daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great excellent price and product is as described and price was right i bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books this stand works great for me and hold even the largest of my music and tab books the construction is much better than other portable stands i ve used in the past and has two great features that i really appreciate one is it s height adjustable and two is the tilting head the tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad and this one works great for the price this stand is a great buy that i would recommend to anyone but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional with the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make the korg cm l clip on contact microphone for tuners is a great product i would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument my instructor who has been playing a violin for about years brought one to my private lesson recently because it did not pick up extraneous room noises it made tuning my violin for the lesson so much faster and easier nice bright light i have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about years as with many things i m a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music this light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything the switch is conveniently located on top of the light the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move unlike my twin lights
388	i have a taylor ga e the elixir strings that came with it had nice bass but were very bright i tried some martins ej s which i love on my seagull s however those strings just didn t have enough bass and too much highs i bought these recently and i love them they are much better then the original strings very rich bass that really comes out the highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright my one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me anyway the best sounding strings with the setup i have now off to buy some different bridge materials edit i also put these on my seagull mini jumbo and wow every time i come back to it after several weeks i forget that i put the ls on it then i pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are john pearse strings worth every penny i tried these on my talyor ga e and the sound was just a bit to bright the heavier bass strings didn t really add the bassy sound i was hoping for just more of a thud ymmv this partial capo from kyser has the same design construction and ease of use as kyser s top ranked and bestselling string cano it is definitely recommended if you choose to go down he partial capo path though it s best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy randall wolliams manual on the partial capo since its use is not intuitively obvious
389	very very good product i have no complains about it definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing this thing freaking rocks i love this pedal i can t stop using it sometimes i just play long drawn out chords so i can listen to this amazing tone in combo with distortion on my amp it s perfect metal ive been trying different strings for years ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change these are very bright and clean very playable these are nice and sturdy picks they sound real clean i m having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics these are good quality strings that will last on your guitar for many months to come probably my second favorite after ernie ball i was expecting something a little bigger it will do but next time i probably will look for something with a little more stability the dimarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available the dunlops tend to release if they re bumped and the schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments the dimarzio models are extremely comfortable easy to install and very easy to use i m really happy with this pedal give a good phase sounds like waylon would use simple to use one knob and it doesn t boost or reduce the signal i needed a phaser and saw that the joyo vintage phaser was rated well and super cheap so i bought it i was extremely impressed with it and did some further research into their pedals this was one of their top rated pedals so i figured i d give it a go i have to say that i am fairy impressed i get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box anything from a light fuzz to a vintage style high gain you won t get a modern metal crunch from it so if that s what you re looking for look elsewhere if you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the s and s then this is a great bet this pedal is currently plugged in and i suspect that i ll keep it as part of my rig unless i happen to get rich and find a nicer boutique pedal or get around to modding my other pedals as a reference i own several boss distortion over drive pedals japanese ds sd od and mt i the joyo jf and od are the two drive pedals that i have hooked up since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that i currently own a side note for the tone freaks the peddle does seem to be a bit muddy it s great for jamming out power chords but not so articulate when you re arpeggiating chords still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp
390	if you don t know what type of pick you like buy a sample pack picks make a big difference to sound and playability these are thin and flexible easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general however the tone is different so you ll need to decide what songs they work for etc as far as quality these are great easy to grip and as durable as most this power supply is great for me i attached it underneath my pedal train and it works great the knobs you see on it can sag the power to be less voltage you can get your pedal to sound as if it has a dying battery in it this pedal does exactly what my title suggests it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz very smashing pumpkins feel to this it doesn t do many different tones but what it does it does very well and frankly once i find a good tone out of a pedal i don t change it often anyhow this is an amazing value and a welcome party of my pedal boards p s i have the russian variant i bought these because i couldn t see spending a dozen at the local music store i figure dozen will last me for years get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like i can easily do this is a very cheap little practice amp and i hoped i d be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my gf nuts unfortunately i have a couple of problems the headphone and aux quality really wasn t that great and using great phones the sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier i just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be for quiet practice you re best getting a vox amplug imho sounds great much cheaper and integrates external audio better
391	just received this cord and it seems to work as expected what can you say about an adapter cord it is well made good construction and sound from my dslr with my mic is superb never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings for the price paid it s very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired overall i can not recommend this product at the current price it s sold at to dollars then sure still it s an ok product it was cheap it s not put together well so don t plan on taking this thing on the road also on mine the boom arm is very difficult to extend but as it will staying in one location for most of it s service life it ll do wow the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry but plug in some real mics and voila the dr becomes something special but i do not always want to carry around so much equpment and was hoping for better internal mics honestly my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing and why is the line out so darn noisy must be defective oh well gonna have to send this back
392	good strings with good sound the extra light is easier on the fingers but they sound thinner too go for the light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure bought roughly of these i like them and my playing buddy likes them has a sticky bottom if you want to peal off the paper and stick on table etc i keep one in each case enjoy received them in four days just in time for my first lesson can t say much more than that because i am just beginning lessons and don t really know what to look for yet a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
393	this is a great effect awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should no need for the evh red logo version unless you re a super fan or something i actually believe this unit will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended i m not a performing musician so i actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand holds everything from a mm nylon pick to a mm rubber pick and i have yet to see one fall out simple solution to a simple problem the seller shipped very fast and i give them plus stars this review is regarding the actual product the behring us is a basic pitch shifter don t expect elaborate effects made of plastic not as sturdy as a boss pedal goes through v batteries quickly so stock up if you use an a c adapter get a hum eliminator curse you cycle also run the us after the distortion for optimum performance other wise you are shifting the clean signal distortion pitch shifter chorus then out this pedal gives you a sweet string chorus sound and that alone is worth the bones the dive bombs reverse dive bombs and flutter are there don t expect a octave bottom because it doesn t do that you will not sound like a thin lizzy dual guitar lead but you can get that bryan may queensryche meets the allman brothers harmonies in rds for those on a budget this pedal does what it doesn t advertise lacks true instructions so go to youtube and watch demos i actually purchased this item refurbished on ebay it is out there for to no buzzing and crackling and no more wires no more shorts in the cables or stepping over cords finally the technology is here for inexpensive wireless the relay g has perfect frequency response because it is in the ghz band like a wireless wifi router or cordless phone all the soft clipping is there for every nuance in fact i don t hear any interference at all even with a single coil some feedback is good but not that screaming feedback loop from cables missing their grounds i play directly into a line pod and can piggy back wah pedals and other effects with the relay g on front it is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable this is a professional wireless system best purchase i ve made this year you won t be disappointed it is worth the price keeps gear dry not for airplane travel or shipping but perfect for spare guitars zipper works fine fabric as good as gig bags three times as much
394	there s nothing complicated about this purchase it s a cable it works it doesn t cost a lot it s a great deal get it i use it every week and it still sounds perfect then again i never mistreat my equipment we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system it s very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles i bought a set of s and s and i also have some d addario s the s are super slinky just like the name says they re great for quick movement around the fret board my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding i play a lot of rock and sometimes these just don t pack a punch like the s or s do all in all though these are great strings and i will definitely continue to buy ernie ball i ll probably opt for s or s though summarygreat pedal buy it you ll probably keep it at its price point stars i am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds it reminds me a lot of how i used to set up my super reverb amp compared to all pedals i d actually give it stars downgrading star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the rise control but i liked it so much i decided to score it at its price point pros dirt cheap at for a new pedal sounds great does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise i wish i could say the same for some pedals i ve tried latched unlatched mode the best feature on the pedal i love that i can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts small form factor normal single pedal size standard power supply v center negative runs from pedal board power or a battery the larger foot pedal surface compared to just a silver bullet switch is nice for the unlatched mode usecons cheap plastic case i doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case latched unlatched switch is small hard to reach have to bend over can t do with a toe rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound probably not needed on this pedal two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability like most pedals the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe and the settings are hard to see my favorite pedals have large knobs well marked settings you can see from a distance enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another and in the best cases enough space size and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump suggested redesign super vibrato or vibrato ii change to a metal case lose the rise control altogether put the latched unlatched modes on a nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes increase the size of and space between the other two controls put large foot controllable knobs with high visibility knobs then again at bucks i might just buy a nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode i ve bought these d addario strings a few times because they are a great deal they sound nice and bright and they last a good while they are easy on the fingers the best part is that you save money by buying them in a pack i like purchasing the pack because i have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings you can t beat the price i have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way i already owned two of these tuners previously purchased these for friends they are great for jamming with friends are so user friendly accurate what is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze i love mine so do my friends in my opinion for the price they are hard to beat i m not going to recommend this over the capos it s better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made i decided to try this one out but the construction of it makes it feel like it s going to break if i pull it too hard and because of that it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove but once it s on it works
395	these strings are just okay they last about months and then they start to fray a little bit was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well i still use the kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly a little small for my hands but the kids that take lessons from me loved them cute idea would like different holiday designs like this the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble got these because i wanted some extra capos around they work fine and are a great price they do seem to be a little hard to open spring seems a little tight good deal as back up capos this guitar tuner is simply amazing i feel like i should have paid at least bucks for this thing but is practically a freaking steal the display is so nice the quality is amazon and this thing is beyond accurate never using another tuner again in my life snark forever
396	love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses if all you want is amp like vibrato and chorus here ya go and it s cheap and cool looking bigger footprint than a boss pedal the hue control gently affects the tone i ve had the amp for months or so now and love it it s choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me i don t have the greatest guitar ever but the sounds from the amp are clean and crisp the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other less useful effects the auxillary jack is also a great addition the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use best distortion i ever used it took me a while but i finally got that preriphery protest the hero tone with this plus my overdrive it s tough to shell for a pedal that is not an effect but now that i ve had it for a few weeks i m glad i bought it although my guitars pretty much stay in tune warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while i m playing them the boss tu is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time when you play in a band you got to have a pedal tuner and you can t go wrong with boss this is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers i ve used it for months with no issues at all it sounds great it works perfectly and it was as for quality control i have several joyo pedals and i can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome i ve never used a phase so the clone factor was a moot point when i purchased the joyo vintage phaser it works it s simple to use and i had money left over to buy more gear i ve been playing for years and i highly recommend joyo pedals if you don t like it get a refund it s not rocket surgery
397	this thing does just what it was supposed to i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that and it does just what it is supposed to these picks r awsome i have tremmors in my hands and have a hard thime with pick control they have a gell center whitch tingles it feels like muscles are activating in your hand great theraputic picki seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks these picks have a indentation so u know where put ur thumb and index fingerthey really do what they say if u have hand problems try these they really work i have a gibson les paul that i bought used when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape but very dry i first tried lemon oil and it would work but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it its rosewood so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey i ordered it and applied it a few hours later i restrung my guitar and started playing and didn t care for the way the fretboard felt i think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn t completely dry i decided to give it another hours the next day the guitar neck looked and played great it is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ bends and slides are smoother than ever great product and one that i will continue to use if you need a quick treatment before a gig or something i would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation i have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig but not enough power for pedals this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for dc distribution a being a studio owner i didn t buy this for stage work being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades i ve had many different tuners including real strobes so when i picked this up about months ago it was because i needed one where i was at and right now i don t know about the accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it s quite accurate enough that i can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it by using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments i m still using the replacement battery i put in about months ago but i just use it and unplug it s travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from feet and continue working i was shocked by how well it works i was shocked by the fact that i could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close highly recommended
398	there are two ways guitar strings go bad if you leave them on long enough the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode but that takes months if not more before that happens grease from your fingers dust bits of skin and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings between the windings this interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound back when strings were a lot more expensive some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them some bass players still do coated strings are a simpler alternative these strings and similar ones like elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings which accomplishes two things first it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap which prevents rust and corrosion second it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings the strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings they do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings but it s not a huge difference and after a month or two they still sound the same they also cost about twice as much as equivalent non coated d addarios are they worth it that depends if you re an active performer maybe you re probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you re getting a bright sound you re probably also buying your strings by the box there s no real benefit to these strings where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy these days i m strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year i have four acoustic guitars and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played with coated strings i can leave a set on a guitar and a month or two later i can pull it out of the case and it s ready to play i still change strings if i m going to be playing in public but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house these are great the strings are slightly smaller than the j and deliver a great sound several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try thanks again this capo works very well it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design the rubber seems to hold well it s a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time but i ve had no issues as of yet my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capo s design i also have a quick change keyser and i can say i prefer this one for practice sessions but the keyser for performing this one is too slow for the stage this is a good pick they give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely however they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot after trying a few others i settled on wegen picks they make the golden gates sound bleak in comparison wegens definitely click less are easier to grip and bring out the natural woody sound and character of the instrument if you are looking for something that will progress with you you may wish to look elsewhere
399	i love these pedals inexpensive to purchase easy to mod to your liking this pedal received the gain and jcm mod i will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost love this pedal finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in finally died a great pedal well made these dunlop mm picks are the right size not to big or too small been using these for years always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases they never wear out they are not too stiff or too flimsy they work good for the sound on the strings easy to hold on to i think many most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try my favorite picks for the last years are snarling dogs brain picks they re nylon picks that have a raspy cat s tongue surface that makes it super easy to grip i ve also had a few of these gator grip picks for a few years now and i like them quite a bit but they re not my favorite i tend to use something around or just under mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic these picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them sound wise i don t find that they re significantly different from any other pick if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my i needed an eq pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it s eq most distortion pedals i plugged into it ended up sounding way to bassy and so i bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little i really didn t expect much since this pedal was so cheap and for a brand new one at that i was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids if you re looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar i d recommend this these cables are perfect the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent i really love monster cables i love these customs inbetween the lights and mediums you get the bright booming sound nice bends and of course the longer playing life i ve used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in them to brigthen the sound a tad i would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye i ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try i d been looking for a boom attachment for a non boom stand because i play guitar and sing this seemed perfect and it is regular booms have always been a necessary evil in my book they can be helpful but also take up too much air space on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces this thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself the other thing i like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock so you re not just tightening a joint and relying on friction as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired anyway no reservations about this one a dead simple idea that works great this a very clever idea it helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space very easy to take off put on high recommend this to any stringed instrument players there are a ton of phaser options out there even from mxr themselves which makes this issue a bit confusing i d owned a phase back in the s and wanted another one a few years ago i didn t have the budget to consider the more expensive mxr versions so i just got this one i think it sounds fine i gigged with it for years without issue yes there s a slight volume bump but i think this is really mostly a midrange hump that will alter your tone and give you some distortion depending on how your amp is set up i always use it with a clean tone and i m used to it so it s not a big deal if i were to shop for a phaser today i d consider some of the other mxr models as well as versions from other manufacturers which offer a mix knob a phaser is a very specific sound but i love it in small doses for my needs this one works i play guitar i bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago they re very interesting these are soft rubber with a little bit of give so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies similar to using your thumb but not exactly i still pull one of these out every once in awhile in certain applications getting a particular sound for a song say these could be exactly what you re looking for overall these are well made and the ones i bought will probably last me forever but these would never work for me as a main pick i m glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them i ve tried all types of these and they re pretty much as advertised i don t really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber but it is there to a small degree to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic well they don t sound bad but if you then switch to a normal pick you ll notice the upper and upper mid harmonics that are being de emphasized by the duller attack it doesn t sound bad and in certain applications it would be fine i wouldn t want it to be my everyday acoustic tone though they fare much better with electric guitar where the difference in attack can be less notable but you ll still notice the loss of some sparkle but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable the pick tends to catch on the strings a bit there s more friction of course but it s just something to get used to the bottom line i like these and they ll probably last me almost forever but i don t really see them becoming my go to picks i like the thickness and the feel they won t slip out of your hand while playing but the loss in high end is just enough that i don t think i want to limit myself in that way except for certain situations i tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway so i already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers worth a try though and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that s just a bit too bright you know at higher volumes too it s easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized and these might work better in a live setting where you ve got your amp cranked up works great but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time some responses to comments i ve seen in the reviews i ve had mine for years used moderately and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible haven t put a pad there or anything the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz however range of motion is on the wide side to get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic i have to put it right on the edge of the st string and screw it down all the way and it does sometimes leave some buzz the price is nice though so i would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo this is a very nice way to get rid of all those wall warts and batteries for your pedals easily powers my pedals and adds no noise to the signal path simple effective works as advertised the extra adapters are a nice touch get one you ll be happy you did unfortunately i wasn t aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when i need the large the medium fits over my pinky finger and while that s okay i prefered it fit over my index finger where i d have more control i cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so i ll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger dunlop slide for the most part this is a well built durable gig bag i only rated it at stars for the lack of padding if you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you if you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case remember you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that this is my first experience with a high end guitar cord after playing for longer than i d like to admit for many years i ve been playing with any old shielded solid core cord without regard for much besides price in prep for an upcoming gig i bought spectraflex fatso right angle cords i find them to be very well made with shrink tubing sealed strain reliefs at the high quality plugs thick and heavy duty cabling but not too think nor too heavy and best of all very quiet presumably because of superior shielding they were what i consider expensive about each but for me well worth the price and considerably less than many other high end cables i found and read about i imagine that they will last for years i think i will eventually replace all my dozen or so cords of various lengths with these j m tepper this is a star stand considering the price sure it s not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what it s supposed to do without any problems i don t forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough it s a music stand so i don t see how it would take a lot of abuse this is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very easily get one of these and you ll soon have guitar picks coming out of your ears my only issue is that a pick punched from say an old credit card isn t going to replace my favorite picks it s a great idea it s executed very well no issues with the product itself but i find that it s not incredibly useful to me if you re not particularly picky no pun intended then one of these will supply you with picks for a lifetime
400	i ve tried a few different straplock options and these are the best not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good highly recommend especially for the price this is a great buy the strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when i would slide up and down the fretboard and i was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too the only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren t shining like they use to i just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure i wiped it in off as thoroughly as possible which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as i went from fret to fret not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing the ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever take minutes and do you and your guitar a favor i own three of these and have them attached to the back of my headstocks great idea great concept and great quality only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that i have recently adopted dunlop jazz iii the dunlop max grip jazz iiis and my dava jazz picks just won t stay in there without slipping out for regular sized picks it s a perfect product for smaller sized picks i improvise by using sd card cases perfect fit for jazz picks for the price they are awesome strings i like the sound i like a little heavier sound and i m hoping the high e will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge its always the first to go you cant beat the price on amazon i paid at my music store but i needed strings asap i will order back ups at this price these picks are nice they re great for metal if you like a durable pick the paint fade away after a while but don t let that stop you it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time
401	i purchased this when it was on sale during the christmas season i figured that for the asking price at the time i could not go wrong my expectations were frankly low i had heard nothing but horrible things about epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability what i received was the polar opposite i received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when i unboxed it i am not wild about the strings that came stock but i am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums i guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads in the near future i intend to restring the guitar withd addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar strings light which while thick should make the instrument jazz friendly i realize that flatwound strings will require a new set up and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investment out of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared to my novice eyes and fingers to be properly dressed i have already invested in a good but not great case guardian hardshell electric guitar caseto store the guitar i also uploaded a customer provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits for the record i use the following amp which i have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar kustom defender watt class a guitar headthat i run through akustom the defender x guitar extension cabinet for h head bottom line this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players the price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards well duh does it work yes and no first it did not appear that anything was coming out after a bit of rubbing i did notice a slight bit of solution turns out its mineral oil on the fretboard by the frets i tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless a paper towel would hold up better seriously i used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around but honestly it took me to mins and i noticed no difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar it says to use it before and after each session thats about mins of my time per guitar i general play guitars durning the course of a session i do still use this occasionally but i would not spend money to purchase it again just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner i like this product so much i buy them two at a time but i wish i didn t have to the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me so it s like that guy who asks for a lighter uses it and puts it in his pocket every single time these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter i understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers it s a decent tool at a good price so buy one then see how long you can own it the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning i can t say i m a polish connoisseur but this stuff seems to work very well it shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks i m not very diligent in my guitar maintenance so this bottle should last me for years wow something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit these are great lights for music stands if you need a good blackout light themighty bright pedalboard light blackhas a red light that works great for dark stages because they are led the batteries last a long time some of the mighty bright lights also have an ac adapter option but this one doesn t let me be upfront i often use my electric guitar unplugged when i am plugged in i don t move around a lot so this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing but no hum or noise and seems solid it was very affordable can t say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time but for the price i can not complain at all i suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage small size easy to transport and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy but improving guitar playing p i got of these for my electric guitars they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent do be careful when un folding as pinching of skin would be very easy the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well i have had no problem with the foam cushion so far i have modern finishes on my guitars i don t think i can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing my epiphone lp seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the turser strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include all in all these aren t bad not quite perfect but a good value for the money this is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your fender mustang amp it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised this switch is not bulletproof but works great for playing around with your small practice amp this is a star stand considering the price sure it s not as sturdy as one costing a lot more but it does what it s supposed to do without any problems i don t forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough it s a music stand so i don t see how it would take a lot of abuse i love small amps and have played many of them over the last years i still own a few my favorite being the first super champ from the early s rivera nailed that one i naturally prefer tubes for that true tone but tried one of these out last year at a pal s place and was sold within two minutes i bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then i can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp i ve ever used for the money it s a crazy deal i have never once used the included online stuff or the ableton software so those add even more value to this package no doubt all i wanted was a warm up amp with real tone and this is that and plenty more my all time favorite tone is the clean glassy fender late s early s sound typified by the bassmans and twins and deluxes of the pre cbs era that tone needs tubes to really sing but to my amazement the amp modeling of this mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes you ll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there especially on the bassman settings my strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings and my prs absolutely smokes with real lease breaking volume on super sonic dial the gain way back for a nice low throttle roar having gain volume and master lets you dial in a ton of tones with each amp model and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus tremolo etc plus various reverbs delays etc though i find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by if i can t get the tone i want with my fingers then i need to learn how to is my motto and this amp is so accurate that i can above all this mustang is musical for a small amp that s a real feat but for clams it s a near miracle add a built in tuner the most useful extra any amp can have good effects great amp models the software and more online amp models which i ll get around to one day but so far i get all the tone i need from the amp as it is plus watts for lots of headroom and this is a straight up steal for a bill the only thing missing is serious bass at volume but this is an after all not a so you ll always miss some of the real bottom but what s there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides you could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy all told the mustang i is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now crate and line etc don t come close but paired with a mini strat this would be the absolutely perfect beginner s set up for a kid looking to play anything from the beatles to metallica and everything in between can t recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can t come in a small solid state amp it can it does and it s cheaper than i can still believe fender truly went to on this one leo would be proud this amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers and name on an old card and give guitar picks at the same time the edges are a little rough but it is a punch not a precision cutter one of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed
402	this is a very good cable i don t forsee having any problems with it it s just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables if you need this get it the price is right and shipping was right on time completely quite connected with no problem i own two what makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to pedals it comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip one of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don t stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks takes up less room on your pedal board also the plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss it can put out up to ma which is how it can run up to pedals a great item at a great price no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more this inexpensive pedal kicks ass provides everything from subtle spring reverb to vast cathedral like reverb the space setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note providing a strange harmony some people pick on behreinger because they re stuff is still cheap i admit that two of their pedals of the that i have bought underwhelmed me this one is a keeper just got it so far so good i use delay pretty light n tight slapback vibe not too wet this does it well i considered the mxr delay no i may have considered it but the only pedal failure i ve ever experienced was my mxr dunlop phase first the dc input then the stomp switch after light barely any bedroom use this modtone here seems solidly constructed i haven t played with it too much yet but as of right now i wouldn t recommend it for edge wannabes seems limited in that regard i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes no we do not good tone though does the trick trick
403	i use different kinds of picks this one is very special the strings rings out really pleasant and great for speed picking too i should have read the reviews carefully it s definitely something different but not sturdy at all rubber bits come off as you strum and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers ouch i m much happier with my friday the th glow in the dark picks that is an experiment that worked and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming why don t you use your fingers after reading the reviews i expected the leather to be a tougher than it is it s soft without being limp there s no break in time required i bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great i like to keep a pre adjusted strap in each guitar case and i m planning to buy another one of these for my martin this is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar if you don t enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but don t like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar won t slip out of the strap while you re playing then upgrade to this system if you are fan of the jazz iii you will definitely like the ultex version from my experience the ultex has the sound and feel of tortex but without the memory aka wear the ultex is thicker than the standard nylong jazz iii s and only when directly compared will you notice that the ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surface five stars for being a better jazz iii however the prices for these on amazon are absurd i got mine through musiciansfriend for around shipped i m only running two pedals so i m not sure how far you can push this but it s working fine for my setup i have always loved line this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up it went dead i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead i am sorry to say that i returned it my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs i am really disappointed
404	takes the edge off the violin sound i keep it on my office violin so i don t disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly i have a chezch violin and it s sparked my year olds interest my pegs are in great shape but i figured i d get this oil to make starting to play the violin easier on him i have one of these for a lanikai tenor and one for a stagg soprano the soprano one fits great even though it s a different brand perfect
405	i usually use martin sp s but i decided to give these a try i m pleased with them but i would not rank them above the sp s i did a little recording with them and i have to admit they sounded a little brittle herco is a jim dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part i wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood i have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist the product came fast and the instructions are straight forward i may order another if this one performs well not a whole lot to say about it quality materials works well love to keep my taylor on it but had to re case the guitar during our low humidity days this tuner is nice inexpensive and very easy to use it does a very nice job keeping the instrument tuned i ve bought capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit well the hunt is over amazing tone perfect tuning i m completely amazed with this capo
406	i have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man the neotech is by far superior to anything else i have hooked up to my gibson ess the straps are easy to hook and unhook i have two sets on my banjo one set for the neo and another for the harness i use when the back needs a rest it s easy to uphook one and hook the other well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts so these are pretty great strings not much to say the price is really good about ten dollars a set which is really good i rated it at stars because stars means i love it in amazon s selection of things i do love it in fact i think it is better than my sans amp bass di which costs more don t get me wrong the sans amp is still great i just find this easier to dial in it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp the only down side is that it doesn t come with an ac power adapter that isn t a problem for me since i have many power options on my pedal boards this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals if you have been playing bass for a while you know that no matter how good your bass rig is you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your amp that being said i am in my s and i play mostly guitar hero music like robin trower srv hendrix yes rush and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc the fun old rock n roll stuff like the sans amp putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple the tone that i love to dial in is that old piece rock band sound from years past think of mel from grand funk railroad or old james gang in the joe walsh days johnny winter and the cream that over driven cranked ampeg or fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a piece power band i am running this into an ampeg bass combo and i have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous playing bass is a side gig for me since i am mainly a lead guitarist i let my bassist try it he also uses a sans amp bass di at our gigs and he immediately went online and purchased one he is another cool use for this pedal if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible try it i play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun that s all i can say it makes me creative and i have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this it s just fun i play guitar bass and violin and more i have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay in fact that may be saying too much i was really surprised at the snark sn tuner i found it very accurate i compared it to my boss tu tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter i decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the snark no one would ever do this this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope i plan on buying the higher quality snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter very impressed with this if i can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board i will be happy these are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so i don t have to move it around as i change guitars during performances sound quality is great i also have the very first jamman with the add on button footswitch i wanted a smaller footprint so i purchased this don t expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though in a band setting your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record stop and playback slightly more difficult than the big jamman looper but very usable this blows away the ditto pedal by another manufacturer i had that one first and it is horrible to use sold it i am happy with it and use it live in a and piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when i am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages excellent quality it has a lot of great syncing features but i do not use those find a youtube video to see all of its potential best looper for the money
407	not much to say about foam they do the job well you can t go wrong i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap great guitar strings and affordable i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly they never used too its not that humid here so i don t know if i got some bunk strings or if the quality has gone down in the last year or if really its the boston weather historically i have sworn by these though i got a pair of these strings in early august i still have them but being as doubtful as i am i just bought an extra pair from this seller who shipped amazingly fast it got here in about days any ways the strings stay bright for a long time don t have not lost there color yet rusted after a little more than four months and they are everything a guitar player looks for in strings i do a lot of string bends and these have just held up to it i have a b c rich sob avenge so i can t tell you what its like with a tremolo but i just like them i have tried out ghs first act dunlop and d addario s and these are the only ones that have last for so long with out showing any signs of significant wear currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount when fully extended the arm can t hold the entire weight of the shockmount yeti microphone i rigged it behind my monitor wall mount frame didn t want to mount the montiors to the walls and it works just fine not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine
408	it s kinda small for my hand but it works great it s more easier to pick the string this pack comes with picks that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost it is a great pleasure to jam on it around sound is like it s real big brother very very familiar i suppose it is the best choise for your kid all hardware is ok just give some days to tuners to get used to works well for my guitar it holds where i left it over a year ago i don t use it all that often though it s a simple strap button don t know what else to say i can t imagine a strap button not serving it s purpose i hate minimum word review requirements
409	although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin it only works correctly above the rd or th fret on my mandolin any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn t have enough pressure to work on the st or nd fret position on my mandolin even though my mandolin has a fairly low action i have a number of kyser capos and very much like the style i own at least six kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a taylor string to a fender american strat without any problems but in this case the banjo capo didn t work for what i need perhaps the capo sent to me was defective although i have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn t seem broken just not up to the task from feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it but i know that i don t have time while on stage to take seconds to set a fussy capo just right to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn t start to buzz on me in the middle of a song i went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo been using these for longer than a decade and met many people who prefer minimal picks and jazz iii among them this is the closest to playing with bare hand that i can get this same chord was almost bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it sounds great and you won t trip all over the place while rocking out so get one today i have used a variety of these types of adapters in the past and these are an excellent newer version in this case i bought just one quick release to use for mounting a kick drum microphone that has the stand adapter permanently attached to the microphone with this quick release installed on the stand and the microphone the kick drum microphone now mounts to the stand in mere seconds and stays in place very well i don t quite know why the locking ring is silver on an adapter that is black everywhere else but at least the ring is good quality and the threads are clean and precise i m reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my behringer xenyx mixer and i finally did after nearly throwing in the towel turns out i was using my mixer s cd tape switch incorrectly thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback i finally went on you tube and found a behringer guy that has a video that s less than minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple i was doing wrong i was over thinking it once i got it to working correctly i could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly including the control on my pc that controlled the recording volume for this unit so now i m looking forward to doing some real recording with it using audacity as my main recording software edit i did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really really pleased with the results i can hardly wait to do some more recording with this so to the arrogant salesman who bad mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a lexicon unit i won t be needing that i m quite happy with this little interface thank you very much and to everyone else don t forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your pc and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on board sound card thanks behringer this is a great value we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices sounds great looks great the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight even fixed another bands vox mic connector his sure cable was loose in the connector this cable was tight has worked on sm nady starpower akg s mxl marshall and mark bass amps and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the xlr s and on the numerous mixers and yes color rules i have large hands i wear an xxl glove but i guess not thick fingers ring size if you want to use this one on your ring finger consider getting a smaller size as for the tone of the slide it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass this capo isn t quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar if i position it just so it will work as long as i don t bump it or a string will pop out of one side these cables are excellent quality cables however if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup these cables are rather bulky and stiff the large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as hosa like many others here have pointed out this is a very good leather strap at a very good price and it is made in canada it is a simple design but it is plenty long enough for a taller than average player is solidly made and did you notice how low the price is i have looked at leather straps for some time and could never pull the trigger on ordering one because of sticker shock on the price most straps i have seen in guitar stores of this quality start in the price category i just cannot justify spending or or more for an overpriced version of this same guitar strap which has some fancy brand name label on it and is of no better quality this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap a nylon strap may work adequately but lacks any real sense of style also most of the name brand straps are two inch or three inch wide and this inch wide strap is just right for me i like this strap so much i am now placing an order for one in every colour i can find them in for use with my other guitars i started with the flimsy grays a couple years ago i switched to yellows recently i ve been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the for all that are having tone probs with this pick consider this your used to using big picks which strum hard easily with these i noticed i have to strum in a tighter stronger pattern than before to get the same tones anyway the attack on this pick is so just yes it flows in sweeps like yes i will never switch from the pick oh ya the grip is perfect haven t popped one outa my fingers yet just my two cents very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked the attack knob the control for how much compression you want to apply did absolutely nothing i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one but none the less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board
410	this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratch proof stance not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some an attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed but everything from tenor uke and up did just fine purchased after another folding stand which cost the same literally fell apart this one is much better although not quite as portable on the plus side music stays put on this one it s very stable and the height is fully adjustable you can buy with confidence good quality strong and excellent finish nicely priced a foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing a must for classical players i really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use however it broke not too long after i bought it one of the connections broke that is i think they might have made it a little more durable since then moreover i sent it in and they replaced it so that was cool it would be nice though not to have had to do that the fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new the great part about it is the design the fact that it is wide enough to run along all six strings is a definite plus the things i don t like about it is the top does not close tight enough and can come off during any kind of travel once the top is off or just not closed properly the pad dries out and then it is useless also the little cloth that comes with it is almost impossible to fit back inside the container once you have opened it as stated it was really good at cleaning and was easy to use but i was only able to use it once because the top came off and it dried out unfortunately because of that i would not recommend this item go with the fast fret
411	these cables are great in microphone or di box applications they are clean of any electrical noise having color coded cables are also good too i like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere i use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar the right angle is nice because it s low profile and fits perfectly on my board even when i put it in it s travel case everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem my pet use to roam the car while driving he has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more these strings are amazing they have increased power tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have they sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups the tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone i cna t say enough about them but get some for yourself i d be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings i switched over to using an android tablet for notation when playing music all of my tablets fit and even my larger hp touchpad fits i ended up using an ainol fire as my regular tablet it would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand
412	i did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area and look like i make very good choice this is the first guitar i ve bought without playing it first so i was apprehensive but it s a fine guitar it s plain to look at no decoration or embellishments but the sound is rich and full as if it were at least ten years old i like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing the tuners are geared low which allows precise tuning it came with savarez strings not the best i ve used but good and i was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag it s strong and durable and well designed all in all i doubt i could have found a better quality product for such a low price i ve owned a bunch of tuners over the past years and this one is the best i ve ever had for an acoustic guitar it is easy to operate has a nice large display that you can easily see and it s small enough to carry anywhere it is fast accurate and the battery seems to last forever nothing to complain about here stars all the way the planet waves tri action capo features a trigger action which makes it easy to put on and remove compared with any other style of capo i ve ever used as the product description says it has a built in pick holder which certainly is not necessary but which is a feature that some users will find attractive if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing don t worry what looks like a spring actually is a spring the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that vise grips work this capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes and narrow neck standard acoustic guitars as well as acoustics with wider necks e g godin s seagull guitars the only quibble i have and it s a minor one is that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments once adjusted though the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz
413	throw this bad boy in anything and it will make a world of difference particularly if the tube being replaced was a cheap tube these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well as other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it s not abused i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects i have found that the delay works well around percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay i don t know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves it s purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some eq tinkering i found a good mix of echo i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d and thought it would be a good idea again danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp to my ears this is a sm it sounds identical someone with super human ears will tell you otherwise and they may be right but i have been recording music for years and this mic is as good as any shure mic i have had and it s only half or less of the cost i ve been using sennheiser s for years and while i am very pleased with them i decided to try the ath m ss on a whim i spent a little more than what i ve been paying for the sennies but it was well worth it i get more of a flat response which is exactly what i needed for monitoring my audio mixes and a trivial bonus a straight cord i hate coiled cords i have had the shure version of this mic not naming any names haha and this mic is just as good actually i take it back it s better than the shure mic because this one isn t overpriced
414	i ve been using a one spot to power a gator small pedalboard for about years now in that time i ve done probably over gigs and i ve never had a problem is it super quiet no but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups there will be noise it s a fact of life i ve never found it to be excessive turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you re not playing i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard first behringer pedal i have returned almost no effect provided by pedal i have returned the unit not worth it lousy pedal i wanted a noise reducer because i have like pedals and the loud feedback i was getting back through them was insane i got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not it s like it was a great choice the pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesn t alter your tone it does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden it s great and nice its like really just wow you know like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it
415	just what i needed to position my guitar while seated i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well
416	i did my research on this buy i looked at a lot of reviews as well as youtube reviews comparing other headphones and these seemed to be the clear favorites over other competitors such as beats pro in which you re spending at least of the total on just the name alone such a rip off if you ask me these are very clear and fine tuned my only knock on these is that they could use a little more padding for the top of my head for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build it matches my epiphone sheraton ii well although it doesn t twist easily my neck strap pin is on the backside of the guitar yes a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior easy to install strap locks use on blue strat and looks great enjoy this is my first strobe tuner so far it has been wonderful for intonation initial setups it may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure it is accurate the only thing i don t like is that the housing feels cheap like plasticy cheap it was packaged in an attractive tin which is not good for fitting in the guitar case and i wouldn t take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the go to tuner it is easy to use though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tuner update the battery life is short as noted by another reviewer since i only use it for initial setups and intonations i remove the battery when i place it back in its tin there s a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful
417	i play guitar and it s necessary to have the mic angled toward me to sing long boom mics make small stages a bit hazardous to negotiate this little boom gives me a way to get close to my mic without having a long boom cluttering up the stage great product i purchased of these items to use with my band for the guitarists i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description i wasted my money don t waste yours perhaps viagra would be helpful i use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum these are heavy duty and well made really reasonably priced i love em you can t have too many adapters if you are a sound guy this handy gadget converts a balanced or unbalanced mic cable to an unbalanced jack simple and it works i ve got a couple in my kit and they do what they say and come in handy when working with unknown equipment i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely i would and do recommend them to anyone looking for quality at an affordable price i purchased of these of the four was no good on arrival another failed after short time uses i will not buy more the first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these for the should be more dependable very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight cannot go wrong with this one like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa i also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to mark everything that comes into contact with the floor so needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my dean from hell i had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar hoping that they would all arrive at the same time so i was unaware at how heavy the dean was this one looked sturdy enough and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweight hollowbody electric but the fact that i had to bend out the pegs just a smidge so the end knobs won t chew up the neck when trying to access store the guitar had me doubting the longterm durability of this product don t need to come home months from now find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules once i get the hercules i ll be using this mount for my rock band guitar controller
418	if you re looking for an inexpensive leather strap this one will do nicely leather is supple not hard and it looks great with natural finish guitars my only complaint is that it is difficult to attach at first holes are smaller than usual probably an anomaly so for the price of polypropylene or cotton you can upgrade to leather i got this for our church i got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall they where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly
419	i have been playing for about years now and have a tak jasmine acoustic and a jay turser strat knockoff i really love the les paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the les paul price i ve read just about everything i can on these epi s and finally went to my local music store to try one out my initial impression was somewhat mixed the sound was good but the action seemed off after playing a few scales and a couple easy chords i began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar then i switched from the rear pickup to the front and bang there was that sound i was looking for classic gibson les paul sound in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat after playing around a bit more i asked to try one in the cherry finish they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing i sat down plugged it in and played a bit instantly i was in love the action was perfect despite the some what heavier strings than what i m used to the sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated tuning is a breeze and is held as well as any other guitar i own i always retune before every session anyway epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar yes i know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck the cheaper humbuckers the flat top construction and the basswood body i point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and gibson electronics i love the simple volume and tone controls yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups and the tun o matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze so much better than having the try to thread thru the body even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing oh and the sustain from it well lets just say i hit a low e last night before i went to bed and i think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning lol if your looking for a les paul sound at a discount price consider this your answer oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at less than any place else and they will do a free setup for me after i ve played it for a while so far it s been perfect out of the box i ve got a mxr mc cae for my concert line pedals but this one is the one i use for local gigs and home use with fender telecaster and hot rod the best thing i ve purchase for my guitars this year i m not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning the and are the best restore the live of my fretboard the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine the only one that i ve just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don t play with it after the cleaning but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase what you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone i m not saying the tone is bad but it s not as good as quality strings with no coat that having been said i m pleased with them as a string for guitar practice they last for months without a change in tone i don t play much in public venues so it is not a problem for me to change strings when i do simple no frills stand only problem i ve had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off a lil glue will fix it just haven t had time a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item if you are a truly music chosen one if you re not familiar with ehx s signature distortion fuzz pedal the big muff please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out describing its sound with words helps but doesn t really do it justice it definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you ll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand they re one of my very favorite effects honestly so for this review i m going to focus more on how the little big muff stacks up against the other models for starters this version takes care of all of the common complaints regarding the nyc reissue its true bypass its much smaller not super tiny like a boss but a little slimmer than say the wider mxr pedals like the phase it uses a normal v adapter jack thank you finally it sounds better yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has this one is smoother not as creamy as the russians but it also doesn t suck tone like that one does either its a touch higher gain than both the russians and the tone wicker versions but all in all it absolutely is a big muff so if you re in the market for one of these and you don t want the options the tone wicker muff provides this is absolutely where its at its better in every way than the ny reissue also it costs less money yay strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost clean well packaged has adjustment for length the hole size is per very good will take some working to get it on the guitar so you need not worry about slipping off i will still use a strap lock nice product i suggest it i got one of these and now a week later i have what a great learning tool simple and sweet i own two of these the first did not have a compartment door so things just roll around inside case not happy but this one is just fine looks great no i would not take it on tour but as far as run around and taking lessons its safe all latches match up well enjoy will order again
420	while the shure sm lc shure sm vocal microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship the beta a needs to be given its due the beta a is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin that is the beta a in the confined live scenarios in which i have utilized it has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues for vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high or really any notes the beta is a dream this same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or popping complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it while i wish that i had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon i can confidently say that the beta a is the best vocals microphone that i have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment quite honestly i would not be at all surprised if the beta compared well even in confined recording situations the bottom line is that the beta a might be more expensive than its popular cousin the sm but it is worth every penny anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority six out of five stars most comfortable picks only complaint is that i would like four in a pack if you use all four fingers buy two sets sat on my snark good tuner but takes some patience no quick tuning but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc would probably buy again however will also get another snark much easier for quick stage sight tuning i ve bought capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit well the hunt is over amazing tone perfect tuning i m completely amazed with this capo
421	not sure that title is good grammar but anyway i have gotten so much use out of my h i m a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye and ear opening for those kids it is very easy to use the various recording quality settings are useful so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space saving mp setting you can record stereo from just in front of the unit or you can turn on way all around recording i ve used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments i often record one part of a duet then play along with it you can do some editing on the unit but it s easier to download the track and use some software to do it i have gone direct to disk though just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end which is some of the editing you can do on the h there is little to fault with it it takes a while to rename a track for instance but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download prior to this i had a sony minidisc recorder which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time i bought it i finally got tired of messing with discs i am very glad i got the h this is a great little uke for the money i ve bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in one suggestion if you re willing to add a bucks to the purchase price buy a set of d addario or aquila strings and put them on right away the stock strings are pretty poor even a set of dollar strings is a vast improvement other than that i love these little guys and plan to keep on buying them finally if you buy this or any other uke do yourself a favor and watch the movie mighty uke you won t stop smiling d addario j ukulele strings sopranoaquila aq s nylgut soprano ukulele stringsmighty uke the amazing comeback of a musical underdog these are great little tuners you can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly which is especially helpful when you re breaking in strings or any time i ve played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts i love these picks i bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy it is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely
422	good strong spring and good strong materials the only improvement i would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck the protector needs to be longer as the protector ages it slips off the end if it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help changed the strings on my epiphone eb bass today for the first time using this product fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare cutter works great winder makes the job really fast minutes it took for all strings next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing highly recommended great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless unless you have a mixer you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this really puts out the sound though and i guess that s what you get an amp for i used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to to fill the place very nice effects on both channels this has got to be the best little tuner i ve ever owned and the cheapest too i have a tuner that works nicely but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to the sn has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn doesn t so i use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there s no place to clip it i highly recommend it
423	i am years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months as you can imagine i need to practice a lot my wife of years does not enjoy my practicing especially when i practice monotonous scales i saw the glaesel violin ultra practice mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor s web site i love it easy to put on and take off the rubber won t hurt your violin bridge or strings you can barely hear it in the next room you can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge my violin s tone doesn t change much at all with this mute now i can practice all i want without fear of my wife divorcing me i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control when i got it i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal as far as a cv controler it sucks at that too why it squeaks as you move it after minutes use right out of the box behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name although only conceived in germany it s a direct copy of the yamaha fc and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares i m betting the extra dollars will be well worth it also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a wah effect at low volume in the studio good luck if you buy it my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings they sound wonderful and cost very little what s not to love this string set offers typical d addario quality and value i use d addario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle this is a great stand it looks the same as any other but it works great for about dollars wow for the price u can not beat this pedal i got this pedal to add a second guitar harmony to some of my songs wow it sounds awesome probably the only note here is that when activate it i noticed that kinda lower the volume a little bit i do not mind though and still give it stars i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes easy to use and perfect size this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle no adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument s size or arrived set for it simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place good value for the price as the title says weeks in and no issues at all it s comfortable and sturdy what else could you want in a guitar strap if you have a trem system on your guitar these bullet ends really do transfer tone energy through the trem block for sustain i added a big block and these strings and it has really brought my strat to life highly recommended my son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it the amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it great purchase don t fret position indicator for violin or viola is very helpful tool especially for beginners if you start to learn violin buy it it will make your study much prettier if you need a cord and don t want to pay a lot this is a good one i was surprised howsturdy it appears the only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine i m happy with them so much easier having my guitars in a stand i can grab when i want these stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced
424	mics are like pants you have to find the right fit this one i like for my vocals live i sing fairly low and airy works great for me also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live very sweet sound i prefer it to the seems a bit more bright and natural might purchase another one eventually works really well this is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something you can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready i needed a volume pedal of a smaller stature for my pedal case and this one fits the bill and it s heavy duty accurate and has a real smooth fall off quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much there are some things in this life that you don t want to have to think about and your tuner is one of them you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board it is true bypass and doesn t add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all your brand preference will guide your decision but don t shy away from this well made piece of equipment i would buy it again
425	if i didn t think that purchasing these items from amazon i wouldn t do it plus and more important i have worked as a purchasing coordinator for over years now i know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not i can find even cables that i can t find in radioshack best buys no where else i have done a lot of purchasing not just for myself but for business these ladies and gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way i would like to apply for a position with them regards ffsalsa tremendous mic love the case and shockmount being all inclusive got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home portable studio love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic i run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear love this little guy i was previously using a blue usb snowball this just sounds so much fuller and more real it is lighter than most fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy speakers the material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging times a week this low cost compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements i connect it to my portable watt amp and provides the sound i need in intimate settings the stand is surprisingly stable and good quality so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable this is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music speeches it is easily mounted on the mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs i would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand i am using it with my samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife s toshiba tablet highly recommended
426	a friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and i loved having an on off switch right at my fingertips genius i bought immediately the shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears two issues to consider the right angle plug was a mm or short of being able to stick into my tele and my takamine it would not seat properly and would slide out i had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side where it worked but now the switch is down there i don t think planet waves is the first connector that i had a problem with that so i dont blame them but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure second issue is simply that these little button switches are fussy you have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them feel wont do if you see the white edge they are quiet elixir is my favorite brand of strings i bought these seeking strings with longer life after a bad experience w d addario strings only lasted a week or and boy i ll tell you these babies last i only change these strings twice a year the coating makes it more comfortable easier to slide on the strings i love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune they also keep in tune good overall these string are a must try for every guitarist i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle this mixing board didn t look that impressive to me when i first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus the fact that it does not have an on off switch is a minus but basically it works well the eq is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer behringer makes a range of models with less more inputs to suit one s needs so this is great also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything well i would have liked some of these things but then i would have to pay more and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far by the way i am running the following through the mixer an at audiotechnica condenser mic an alesis qs guitar via line in or mic d two krk rp studio monitors presonus firebox everything s been working and sounding great thus far the effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me since i am running logic but if i ever use it live which i may do i d imagine they d come in handy the effects are just so so in terms of sounds usable but not that great in my opinion i liked it very useful for connecting rack components between great idea in different colors i will buy it again this is the equivalent to the shure sm except for a quarter of the price the quality is almost the same and in terms of recording they are pretty much the same as well there allow a more natural sound than the sm i believe and are thus a better product i think this guitar rest is pretty nice it doesn t attach on the table very good though so don t rely on this thing too much
427	works a little better at winding strings than the bare bones winders the string cutter is very handy the pin puller as is usually the case is a little clumsy to use but it works these things are so great i get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and i d have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick with these i can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere the thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups very nice one thing yo note is they like to cling to each other so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it but not that big a deal definitely recommend these if you re sick of picks slipping out of your hands
428	got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great price was right i already own two and had no problems quiet no hummmmm buy it if you need a wall wart let s face it i m sure there are better compressors than this for about to times the price but this brought my amp into the light bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction got the danelectro wall wart for it worked great the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for get one if you can read the tiny little screen this thing records nicely but it s a pain in the axx to move from one selection to the other there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on off switch does nothing you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit by and large i ve had great experiences with behringer pedals but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in years of playing no stronger than the reverb in a w first act amplifier i m a string rock bass player that has purchased a lot of overdrive and fuzz pedals most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass they typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end don t provide enough dynamics or don t provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive this incredible inexpensive box really nails it you get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking the downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff the frosted side of me loves that i saved a lot of money buying this ripoff
429	like this camo capo s simplicity and its unique color my friend got a new one after seeing me using it but his is a bit shorter than mine mine works both uke acoustic guitar i have no problem to use it on single hand as the manufactor suggests for its duration i don t clip it on the guitar when it s not in use good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly mostly for electrics i prefer the lighter sound of the acoustic but these work very well with my friends electric fender i love these picks medium is the perfect size for me as well as the majority of people this is a great looking pic and you get of them at such a great price i wouldn t buy anything else a couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and i ve never had cause to remove it at first i thought i d hate the look of it there but it s never bothered me one bit reaching for pics is never a problem i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics this one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz ii i have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz iii in it works out so not too much a big deal use the cloth often to polish my guitar the fender logo makes it look legit recommended to one and all this dunlop pick holder work good for an in expense product it is want i need for travel little hard to put picks in but ok even though i ordered large still not fitting will do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fit i do not have giant hands so large should fit but not this very well made heavy if thats what your looking for arrived on time but good luck this is great stuff only problem no order i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture this works fine smooth slick finish yes guitar slips a little off my knee but very happy just wish had sometype of order yes nice order tks i really like these use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it but once you got it its a fine product enjoy it is just as described i am happy amazon always comes through without a hitch it was delivered as usual before stated time our teenager really likes these as a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers have not broken one yet should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with nd day these have been ordered for a couple of weeks you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day hope they work when they do finally arrive good luck its a little stiff and i m sure it will soften up upon more use cant beat the price i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long yes a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior easy to install strap locks use on blue strat and looks great enjoy tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice this device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy why you would almost think i know what i am doing i had bought an sn and love it but i found it had a little trouble recognizing the low e on my bass this handles bass tuning much better the lit display is great for tuning on stage and because it works on vibration you don t need to worry about muting when you are tuning i also find it very accurate i would have given it stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks this is probably the seller and not the manufacturer it is more than i hoped for very nice protection for my luna it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat so i never had the luxury of the grolsch brand strap locks i tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe but alas i was too slow it s a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a carlsberg bottle cap so the fender ones will do just fine plus they come in colors and say fender time to open another carlsberg cheers fender
430	great pedal very lush and usable tones think lightning crashes by the band live ok i was going to initially give it stars because of the following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does not click very miniscule volume drop with engagement actually i moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and i think that resolved the volume issue but i can t tell i guess if it is too close to tell then it s a non issue then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again metal enclosure works like a charm twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping it gets stars because there is nothing even close at this price i already liked the jazz picks by dunlop these made from the ultex material sound so much better and the surface of the pick is nice even with sweaty fingers they stay put i do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick sweet these are clear yellow picks i would love to see them in red that would be brutal moen pedals are great nice quality at an unbelievable price point this pedal is no exception it is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch to be fair i have not tried many other vibes hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal that being said i am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere vibe is very trower like think bridge of signs chorus is on the mellower side very analog sounding not digital replaced my bbe mind bender and fits the bill so much better solid well built and should last i would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues my only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect i read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led s would fix the problem and indeed it did it s been fine since despite this needed fix i would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if i needed to i ve gotten a number of these joyo and artec pedals now most from earth city sound tx mostly on ebay these days though i recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don t happen to know much about them otherwise i got this one on a whim just to have a second delay i ve had the digitech x series multi delay for many years the fun thing this joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy ufo sci fi ish sounds all one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs guitarists who are fans of yo la tengo and similar groups spacey stuff will dig this box solid hardware side mount ac power goofy graphics of an eagle though i imagine by now they ve updated it s look this pedal lives up to the hype distortion wise it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type od and a full on distortion like a crunchbox or rat i checked out several youtube demonstrations before i took the plunge on this one i think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos more transparent and organic sounding i have owned the fulltone ocd in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly i also own a v dano cool cat od which is an excellent ocd ish pedal but this one is getting more action these days i am running this into the front of either a palomino v or a jet city watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup the pedal also plays well with others i am getting nice lead tones by running a ts type of od into the front of this one the jf is a really nice dirtbox and not just for the price the fact that you can own it for clams or less makes it a no brainer for those of you who like myself are addicted to dirtboxes i have noticed some price gouging with a few vendors on here shop around i knew the build quality was decent because i own the joyo vintage overdrive and they are both built like bricks this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough i like it with the power supply no batteries to fuss with nice sound definitely worth the if you are looking for a literal octave pedal this ain t it this is a good old school fuzz monster and when combinations of notes are played most notably an interval of a th on the lower strings it creates an overtone series that has a subtle octving effect i ve used this pedal to put some growl in my bass kind of an e h bass balls sound i ve ordered of these and only one has been defective not worth shipping it back no big deal great tuner for my guitar class the snark may have a few more features but if all you need this to do is help you tune you re good to go
431	this is a decent pop filter it gets the job done but it has a few flaws it attracts a good amount of dust the screen tends to mess up which caused me to tear the first screen the goose neck tends to unwrap it s self out of place it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in other than that it s a decent pop filter but not for the price under would ve been better i should have went with something cheaper than cough cough the auphonix pop filter cough cough but i will in the future some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life i can assure you that whereas they re not life or death they do make a significant improvement on the listening process especially in your project studio no they re not going to make your music sound any better but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring even cooler is the fact that the pads come with extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever so slightly lastly although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads i can t help but to think that if my monitors were any larger i would need a second pair especially if they were positioned horizontally all and all overpriced or not they really make a world of difference love this little guy i was previously using a blue usb snowball this just sounds so much fuller and more real this keyboard is pretty dope i bought this a while back when i bought my samson key midi keyboard it s been a little over years and i ve used it ever since i recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently you can t go wrong with this stand i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer for the price it does a very good job i don t detect any hum at all and i only get hiss when i crank the volume up too high i recommend this mixer for your home studio it works perfectly with my sound card you do not need usb to get this to work one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers well after starting to use it on windows x i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings i went to the behringer website i found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use windows i am using this with a behringer fx mixer it is a good combo the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough i treat my gear with care i figure it ll probably last for years and years and years i am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect
432	i was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal i only wanted this so that i could pair it with my re to control the intensity and in that aspect i can confirm that it works pairs flawlessly my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive for example i tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a vst synthesizer and it was recognized and mapped without issue but rocking the pedal ever so slightly would cause erratic movement on the filter this is the same behavior that i have when connected to the re in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that s anything but gradual it s not the end of the world but i was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise brough this for trying electric feels on the acoustic guitar and don t want to waste too much money on electric acoustic preamp guitar or big amp if i don t like the efeels after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it i decided to give it a try i didn t expect too much on amp but surprisingly it positively gives me more than i ask for i also brough it with the adaptor which is great to save for long runs and i don t have to worry about the battery for home practices it is adorable out of the box it looks like a lovely toy but it works professionally based on its w amp i don t care much about the manufactor s suggested modes basically i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar uke i like the small size that won t take too much space on my tiny room it s cute to look at and it is practical too i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup however when i changed to another one i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup i almost thought that was an issue from the amp luckily i have two different pickups to try it deeply after using the better pickup the amp doesn t have any issue yet i have used for few times so i don t know about its longevity yet one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar s sound itself won t be muted but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp anyway it s a great feature to have i ve used the fx for a couple of years i ve got a pedal board with several pedals but if i had to take only one pedal with me and i often do when i have to travel lite this is the pedal i take not only do i get a full selection of effects but the pedal doubles as a di unit solving input issues on some problem sound systems i ve played thru that s probably an unintended benefit but i find it a valuable feature which gives me confidence to play thru any system fyi my buddy s digitech multi effect pedal actually introduces hum into systems where this fx has helped me get a cleaner sound while this unit has no tone adjustments it also adds something to make my guitars sound better i know that is sort of vague the only down side of this pedal that i have found is that because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal it is a little hard to make precise adjustments but with what this pedal does do for me that s a small price to pay for this price i can t see why anyone would not like this pedal i ve owned several multi effect pedals in the past even one digitech up til now they all had one thing in common layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments it was a pain then i saw this one with knobs i did a lot of research and was torn between the rp and the rp i decided to go cheap and got the rp so far that was an ok decision the rp has plenty of features and is a good compromise between menus and knobs i recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation to sum up the device quickly the rp is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want but you may need to work at it as with many multi effect pedals there is a selection of factory tone effect profiles to save you the trouble of programming new ones these are mirrored by user defined profiles which are identical to the factory presets the difference is that can be modified by the user or left as is the factory presets are not modifiable so you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory you can also reset the entire device if you want to but if you do you will lose all of your modifications in addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer there are also two additional features which are very useful a pretty basic drum machine and a second looper the looper is really why i bought this pedal it s easy to use and it overdubs i only wish digitech would have made it a or second looper seconds really isn t much fyi you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time no biggie for me ok all that s good so why am i disappointed in this unit pretty simple i m an older guy who has been playing for approximately years i ve played every kind of music there is and i would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets this may be a slight exageration but it seems like of the presets are some sort of obnoxious distortion come on guys not all of your customers are years old i expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices now i m faced with working out all of my own presets i m back to programming menus again ugh so that s about it it s a solid piece of equipment with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from in all honesty if i had been aware of this i would have probably not gotten this unit inspite of its good design and quality i have owned just about every tuner made they all had pluses and minuses i like this one a lot it is my tuner of choice right now the backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate it is also small which i appreciate for this price you simply can t go wrong
433	i got one of these a while back and being like i am with guitars took it apart to see just what it s made of mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but it s plywood body inside kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there otherwise decent build basic original lp design bolt on surprisingly good electronics w full size pots and open back way toggle good neck but bad tuners note any mount tuners meaning mount hole at and o clock position respectively will fit with the bottom hole of the screw junk tuners mine had so add to get more than minute in tune play here and you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with i like the style and though there s plywood involved still good fit and finish though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are only in looks electric guitars don t resonate that s why pickups are important i don t like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys you lose interest learning on something that can t hold good tuning so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that it s likely they ll keep this style but revise it some to be hardwood body and real tuners as i think the price point demands it otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups but snark tuners are great since i ve bought snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way i ve had some for years that i still use today without ever changing batteries or anything they are great and last forever this one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine tune your instrument it have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played really nice piece of equipment for a small price it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
434	for those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky bitey blues material think albert collins this will likely add a little and i mean a little extra oomph to your sound it sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling but you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a hughes and kettner statesman or watt amp too just running it straight to me from what i have heard it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music it definitely doesn t add any more fatness so my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased vitamin e regimen in other words this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are most musicians already use eq and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you re getting out of this pedal i think our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses it looks very stylish and functional as well
435	use it every week at gigs solid no problems with the solder joints a good quality cable at a very good price exactly what i needed to connect distortion paddles to my amp do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers i placed an order threw onlinecarstereo com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones the string are easy to play and sound great there is a reason they are used by so many professionals it s well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market i i do replace it for guitar cable work fine i m happy with this unit recommend to someone need replace cable jct this is a very good quality nice sounding delay you can get that classic slapback sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound very simple to operate and that s what makes these joyo pedals a joy to use nothing fancy but simple and to the point another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely true bypass i have bought the cheaper plastic pedals and they make noise they say that they are true bypass but they are not these babies are dead quiet i run mine through the effects loop on my bugera v tube amp and it sounds great i also own the joyo vintage od tubescreamer clone and it is great as well highly recommend if you don t like too much dirt in your tone this might be the pedal for you the sweet baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally if you have a fairly clean single channel amp it won t give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels however if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking step on this pedal and you ll be rewarded if you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp set the gain low and boost it with this pedal the notes ring clear with the extra bite and brightness to cut thru the mix sweet you can use it like a tubescreamer although the sweet baby doesn t color your sound no mid hump i use it to boost my barber direct drive ocd and the dirt channel on my amp the pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made it s not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives instead of a tone knob it has a focus knob which controls your picking dynamics and presence all the way to the left the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp all the way to the right when you pick the strings hard it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence the pedal is very transparent smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well you can t get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with this pedal basically takes the sound of your amp adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control i just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob at a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after it s a no brainer very nice compressor i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone sustain can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing quiet much quieter than other compressors in this price range no concerns here this is the best octaver i have ever played through i bought my first one in and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive three umm density timbral tonal choices chorused only octaved signal mix clean octaved signal per setting which ranges from to octaves quiet and tiny footprint you d be dumb not to get one while they re cheap
436	second one i bought lousy build quality and only lasted months went through two of these before i learned my lesson don t waste your money on this junk i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk super sturdy well built what more can i say it s a sheet stand
437	i see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts much more fun than a black box i own one of each model i use this tuner to tune up my violin other tuners i ve tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the e string vibrations thus making it hard to tune this tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all strings this is definately worth the money i was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all bought another one for my friend it is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music i really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you these snark tuners are really cool this sn model comes this a metronome and also you can scale up down with buttons for when using a capo highly recommended not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument i bought a few for different basses and guitars but the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag no problem with hard cases leaving the battery dead when i took the instrument out of the case the switch should be on the side of the unit fwiw i like my snarks better faster and more stable tuning a near miss with the ns added december has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the star rating stands without an asterisk added november i put the star back i ve got another one on one of my banjos it does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck either mine or the banjo s to see it clearly but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and there s no neck to snap while it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddle s scroll it seems firmly rooted to the banjo s headstock original november this tuner has a display like the sn rather than the sn after which it is named it s like any other snark super tight tuner i ve taken off star for two reasons i find i have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it maybe it s just a matter of finding the right place to put it i ll keep trying my music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time it was clamped solidly on the scroll but to do that and have it be comfortable to read the tuner was hanging down while playing eventually it slipped off if it weren t kept on this wouldn t be an issue but that s how the advertising shows the tuner being used clamped to a guitar headstock hanging down i ll report back if it doesn t happen again for a while even if this is an issue its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use so i still think it s worth stars
438	for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do it is very will made has the ernie ball logo on it and works just fine i read some of the reviews and that people almost had to guess what strings were what however on the bag that it comes with to prevent corrosion and on the box itself have a color coded guide saying what string is what color on the nut the strings themselves are the normal color for strings i have other harmonica s but thought i d like a set of blues harps i thought that if it s made by hohner it must be fairly good wow was i wrong too hard to push notes through them i wouldn t recommend these to anyone bought this to replace my ft mice cable now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want i ordered them because they are carbon fiber but love them because i don t loose picks anymore i used to lose a pick every other day bought six still have six a week later here s how i keep it about midway over the fretboard slide it between the e b and g strings the three smallest strings and slide it up towards the headstock it has little gecko like protrusions that grip the e string stays in place and cannot slip out wonderful saw this sucker on my bass player s head and got one a few days later not pitch perfect on the fly but keeps you very close when on the run unbeatable value silent tuning so on stage it s almost a must
439	i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use i like the adjustable tension of this capo i don t think its as easy to put on a kyser capo of this style but once on the neck the planet waves ns tri action capo moves easily and has even pressure across the fingerboard a result of the adjustable tension i surmise some day i will use the pick holder not right away some night when i m feeling i need my pick held this works well has nice ergonomics fits all of my acoustic guitars and is easy to use no adjustments are required for my guitars but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo this capo comes with a pick holder and it is expandable with ad addario ns micro clip on tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm i do not use a pick and i use my own tuners so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs this capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars the other one being theg th performance capo the g capo goes with my takamine new yorker and this planet waves goes on everything else if anyone needs to use a capo i loan out mykyser capo recommended i ordered these for my husband the guitar player he loves these strings he said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great highly recommended
440	works just fine except the little knob that s supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings the little pins or whatever it doesn t grip onto mine i have an acoustic jasmine takkamine so i had to get out pliers from my toolbox but that s okay one size doesn t always fit all good price i ve been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade they re sturdy and convenient and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap the ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage or when you don t need the strap hanging from your guitar e g sitting in a chair works exactly as advertised i ve purchased several of these and can t say enough good things about the product and company takes the edge off the violin sound i keep it on my office violin so i don t disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly great quality nice interior and fits my yamaha f perfectly solid and steardy case that will last a very long time i bought to use for my squire strat it also fit my tele to a real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig recently i was looking for some heads to put on a set of starion shells that i modified my original plan was to use a set of attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells that decision was based mostly on price not completely though as i have used the attack heads for resonant heads with very good results the attack heads that i bought though are single ply to me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but i think a two ply head is better for a batter head i gave the attacks a shot on both sides but i wasn t completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to go in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively i still very much like the remo pinstripe heads but decided to give these evans heads a try just to try something different i am very happy i did these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance the most noticeable difference between these g s and the attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated the g s seem to resonate everywhere from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance i have some moon gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound by adding removing or moving the moon gel pads around i can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tune i should mention that i am still using the single ply attacks for the resonant side with the g s on top and the attacks on the bottom these shells sound great also on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides i also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing so the attacks have their place but on the batter side i am very impressed with the sound tuning range and ease of tuning of these g s if you ve never tried them give them a shot if you have you likely already know what i m talking about a good tool for study and applying to your music keep on hand to help understand theory also great for those starting out learning an instrument this is a hit or miss product for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well it s not a total loss since i can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution i ended up with it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on never has watts sounded so loud and clear never think it only hadan inch speaker just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices light weight easy to carry i ve just received my mustang i and have spent an hour playing with it and the fuse software this thing is outrageous for a practice amp and i ve never heard anything like it in its price class and size with a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system i think you could probably gig with this thing one feature in the fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module post gain after the preamp this is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models in effect fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain before the preamp like a normal stomp box i don t know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the axe fx and that costs about times more power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why we re seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the fender champion and bugera v these days their problem is that they re pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes they don t have enough power for that so they re really only good for overdriven sounds not so the mustang i i think fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package this thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest it has the classic fender sound and feel of many different fender amps without the weight cost and tube replacement needs what s not to like excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well
441	definitely recommend these over any other string trees i used both one for dg and be required some minor drilling so i had a guitar tech do it for me just to be safe the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well it delivers massive fuzz plus sustain for that purpose it s excellent both in sound and construction it feels like a metal brick however be warned if you re looking for a standard distortion pedal this is not it it s a fuzz pedal it delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal like say a boss ds if a great fuzz pedal is what you want this is a superb choice and so far as i know the best one for its price if the price is still too much for you consider the modtone fuzzer which is about as good but substantially cheaper at least as i write this seems like it draws current even when it s off i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar i make sure to turn this tuner off before putting the guitar away and when i get around to playing the guitar again to days later the battery is already drained this happened at least three times already the tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that i have to compare against i don t know which one is more accurate the good thing is it s very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it i probably won t buy again for my other and future guitars if you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal i had a boss ds and metal zone mt and did not like them much because they re so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you re looking for then this is for you it offers rugged construction and true bypass the only problem i have had is that unity gain is at around o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone i ve been playing guitar and using capos for years i ve learned this if you are a serious guitar player there are many must have items you need in your arsenal one of them is a capo by clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device they are quite common inexpensive and the basic design really hasn t changed in many years until now that s where this product comes in this capo is great because it doesn t simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob the reason this matters is because depending on the guitar sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension or not enough when clamped too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes either one is not good this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner i highly recommend i put these on a parker great that they have uniform tension took a bit to get used to but they are very playable vlues rock country nice strings these are some bright strings i play with a pick and mostly stay in the realm of rock n roll so no comments on the slapping and popping claims the packaging makes but there are plenty of great rock tones to be found heck crank the amp and dig in with a pick and these would be great strings for any motorhead covers you re planning on playing good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets as rotosounds and they re only a jackson not a bad string put these on my g l s electric sound great play great keeping their tune none broken yet but i don t usually break strings i play at home for pleasure and recording not out hitting the clubs blues blues slide rock metal i use d addario strings a lot i try others but always come back to them these will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on i really like them
442	there s not much to say about this product except that it works it makes my strings last longer sometimes i get lazy owning so many guitars and minutes per well done restring adds up this is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible it s small and conveniently stored too i recommend trying it out this is great if you have to put your guitar down but don t want to put it in its case i bought a set of these to upgrade my kona k etrd a vast improvement over the old ones now it stays in tune better and they re very smooth looks nice too i m a guitarist with a passion for blues so it was only a matter of time before i was going to pick up the harmonica i almost went with some of the cheaper options but i am extremely pleased with my decision it sounds gorgeous very full and clear and i ve already been able to start bending some notes which i understand i notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas as a blues guitarist i was tempted to buy a harmonica in d or a that when played in second position would allow me to play along with blues songs in a or e two of the most common blues keys especially among the songs i like to play the second position for the harp in c is g not terribly common however i think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in c since many of the beginner songs are in c and the c major scale should be very familiar to most musicians in other words as i m exploring the notes they make a lot of sense to me at this price i won t mind buying a d or a when the time comes it s not like i m already at a level where i m dying to play those songs anyway and if i need to there are a couple of songs i ve found in g e g work song by butterfield that song along should keep my practicing for a long time if you are still reading this review then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp add it to your cart it looks nice it s really really long and it s made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip after throwing it into the washing machine x with lots of softener rubbing it with lard dirt and baby powder then soaking it over night it s finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head so buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up
443	it is a nice clip works for my mics i don t like the soft opening it makes you not easy to put back the mics this stands up and holds the microphone in place the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use the tuner is perfect for me it fits in the guitar case mandolin case and the dulcimer case just perfect for making those play dates at the resonance fair always spot on with the frequency nice product
444	i m new to acoustic so i m not too sure how things go but from what i have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good a little to thick for my style though they make a very deep and loud noise i prefer placing electric strings on acoustic they sound much better and aren t quite as loud a bit wimpy but so far they are holding up what a great little gizmo i play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me no more unplugging plugging in between songs just a push on the pedal and i m switching noiselessly between guitars i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well this is my second after breaking the last one s neck the plastic socket around the ball socket joint couldn t take the stress in the gig bag i ll keep this one by the music stand strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice good price
445	the main advantage of this recorder to me is that i can get a good result without knowing much i ve made some surprisingly good recordings of choir concerts in various venues without any special knowledge though i m sure knowing more would make my recording sound better about the only thing you should absolutely learn is to set the mic gain correctly so you don t overpower the mic i don t use auto gain if anything i try to err on the side of low excellent low noise property of the unit means that except some rare cases i can just boost the sound later on pc and the result is still more than passable for my purpose this is perfect for our digital piano we love it easy assembly i would recommend this to anyone its a little stiff and i m sure it will soften up upon more use cant beat the price i used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long it does what a guitar tuner should do it simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning i do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that s about half price better deal if you don t just buy one and have to pay single shipping
446	it s kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already but i can t help it i like this guitar quite simply this is a really nice guitar is it nice no but for less than nice doesn t even describe it my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing the outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problem since i d read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly nope no flaws noticeable to me kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without it other reviews had complained about a too low action but mine seems dead on of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule but even so there s really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low some mentioned rusty strings not on mine the strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well and of course the guitar sounds good again maybe not good but at least good and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price so if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar you ve found it stop wasting time just click the buy it button the construction fabric color and padding are all a this is a super bag my precious uku will always be protected and look good too i used these on my ukuleles and they worked well enough that i bought tow more pairs they hold a regular strap well and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a uke leash google it those are fabulous cheers i looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one i hesitated a bit because i couldn t find anywhere that they specified the width but it was a good price so i took a chance it s about one and a half inches wide by the way i m very happy with it and i like that it has the flexibility to attach one end to either the headstock or a button i can t think of any negatives it s a nice functional non flashy strap that does it s job well and it s wide enough that it doesn t feel like it s digging into my shoulder very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it i would recommend this product to a friend
447	excellent product simple and practical design holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone if humidity levels in your area go below you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks great foot rest it s not flimsy but it s not light weight i put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and i definitely feel that it s there i like that it s adjustable to various heights i am short so i usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when i m playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle but i sometimes adjust it down when i switch it to my right leg and when i m playing flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture i shift it over to my right leg i ended up getting a nd one so that i keep the one at the highest setting for when i m playing classical and then the other one at the lower setting for my flamenco playing great foot rest i recommend it i purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though i make every effort to avoid them and to protect the side where i rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time i ve used carnuba car wax many years ago and this is a much higher grade easier to apply easy to remove there were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that i did not notice at first and i was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface they were very minor and did not affect the wood but this will seal them not a sufficient defect to return the instrument another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal i have open tuning machines and before applying tri flow with a pinpoint applicator i used this wax let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel the chrome is gleaming they re really beautiful did a great job on the headstock as well with mop and abalone inlay when the strings were removed also got the tuning pegs this is a om acoustic only way i can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge i used distilled water so if someone left too much water possibly a problem but all worked fine for me this device works well but sound is far from perfect distortion is more noticeable at higher volume for the price paid is a very reasonable option i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy a must for guitarists
448	my favorite picks can t go wrong with tortex the only habit i have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so i have to buy like a ton of them winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well this is a really nice strap it s very thick and feels like it s well made and high quality for a non bank breaking price on a strap looks cool and vintage i am a fan of many dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all this is a nice pick holder especially for the price it sticks well to the guitar and is easy to use very good product bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang it comes with a daisy chain power cord that eliminates the need for separate power supplies foam inserts easily fit boss and behringer pedals but can be easily cut to house other pedals i had an issue with my new squire guitar and fender hooked me up with a set of these the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end rather then the typical small loop the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity i say they sound great and are worth trying i just order packs so i can have some on hand
449	these screws are not a shiny chrome so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black fender strat body they are good quality screws i purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the tusq i did have to sand to make it fit that may sound badm but i am glad because it s better than too small i did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering
450	i ve used these picks for years with great results if you ve never used this stile picks you won t be sorry they were a little too much for the squier bullet i put them on even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck while i had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness more metal moving over a guitar pickup hotter sound more gain and on a stratocaster more glass and bell like tones i ve used ernie ball s slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound fun fact get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery there is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound ringing out of your amplifier a little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent i ll try to review the strings and not the instrument but that s kinda hard for me to do i ve been playing guitar since my dad bought me a unknown acoustic years ago that should make me about he put some brand new humpty duty black diamond strings on it which pulled the neck up to where the strings sat around off the fretboard well they weren t very close anyway the neck had no way to adjust it so imagine learning to play using heavy gauge black diamond strings a ways from the fretboard i didn t know any better so i thought it was normal for the blood dripping off my bent crooked fingertips since then i ve been through a multitude of guitars and strings i always wanted a les paul but my playing never improved enough to justify i started reading reviews on the epiphone les paul for and they were running from stars i finally after much self convincing bought the ebony through amazon i ve owned strats telecasters cheapies an alvarez i think i unpacked it out of the box did a little tuning and this is absolutely the most beautiful sweetest thing i ve ever held in my life except for the little lady of course no kidding i recommend this guitar to anyone even if it cost a couple of grand strings the ones that came on there sounded great i didn t put it down for a couple of weeks sounds great in the bathroom good acoustics i finally got the best out of that set of strings i always use ernie ball on everything they ve got a wrench to fit every nut in the house i saw some hybrids on amazon and had never heard of them i bought a pack of them along with some super slinkys regular slinkys earthwood silk steels i put the hybrids on the new les paul they made it sound even better than it was chuck barry the ventures clapton set the lp and fender amp right and the sound is just as good the lower strings have a wonderful rich tone they re fairly heavy but easy on the fingers the high strings will talk to you i can bend the g string easier than a super slinky this is the only guitar i ve used them on but they sound great i imagine i ll stick with them for this machine from now on of course amazon is always stars in my book its a nice stand cheap but should suffice i wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine very nice guitar picks for the very fair price i like them very much of course i am just a beginner
451	this is such a nice bag for the price nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever there is a handle and a shoulder strap plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front i have a lot of high end instruments and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying this stuff is fantastic much better than lemon oil dries a lot cleaner and doesn t leave any oily residue on the board at all an hour after it s applied it sets up and doesn t get on your hands i apply it on occasion with the strings on i use elixirs and have never once had a problem the best few bucks you ll spend on guitar care stars please don t listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn t keep tune they don t know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient it only took me about half an hour it clearly states starter pack so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele especially because of the price these people just do not know how to read it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight if you want real protection i would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines it is a great buy though considering the price i highly recommend this product excellent picks with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth the only problem i have is that i keep changing my mind between whether i want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing these are a great addition to any mandolin player s case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a fender heavy
452	i ve been using only these even since trying them wonderful picks for speed and precision you won t go back for sure the title says it all it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks also since these picks are smaller i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out this is a nice pick thicker and easy to hold on to i like the size smaller than your regular picks and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar this pick is def not one i d use to solo with but its def a good pick for slower more acoustic oriented guitar work whenever i play a song consisting solely of chords i break this guy out i m really happy with the black ice heavy picks mm which i bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of dunlop jazz iiis i would call the black ice picks medium sized they are roughly the same size and shape as fender picks but a little bigger than the jazz iiis they are stiffer than the s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the iiis and thinner than the iiis too one thing that may account for the nice way the black ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the s which i still like and from the jazz iiis in terms of playability they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness but the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you the tone i love the tone i get with these picks and the best i can do for you is to say that i was looking for a pick that would generate a solid mellow jazz tone with an archtop a tone that reminds me of say barney kessel but without barney s chops of coursse this is what the black ice delivers easy to install these buttons on the guitar well made and just what i was looking for thank you very much not my first intellitouch tuner i really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar i bought a number of these because after the first one i used i fell in love they have a fuller sound than other picks and the grip on these is fool proof however they don t pinch harmonics well at all and they will not do scrapes up the low strings at all two disasters for classic rock music i never seen picks that wouldn t do these things however i really struggled with these things that seem so easy with other picks however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks i bought this for a friend who s previous tuner was lost i have to say i ve been so impressed by how easy this is to read that i ll probably buy one for myself now other than a great display and accurate tuning this is made with a move able arm between the tuner and the clip the arm is a dual ball joint and allows you to configure this is any position you d like i wasn t expecting it to be this nice very cool
453	this is a solid product i ended up not needing it so i returned it however it worked fine and gets the job done does exactly what you want it to do it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand it s easy to set up and easy to take down if you re looking for a mic stand buy this one you really can t go wrong i bought these to replace a pair of ath m s i had for years i used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully i play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what i hear inside the headphones listening to music on them is a joy everyone has an opinion about a burn in period mine seemed to open up at about hours i listen to music about hours a day i own several of these and general buy from gls direct but i needed some quick and had other orders from amazon so i got them hear at same price gls is great quality and durable i use there and cords and have never been disappointed i ve only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic i wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions jams rehearsals and gigs but i also wanted the option of just capturing a line source such as from the di on my bass amp bingo toss in the dual mode overdub phantom power ability to run off usb power and it is a total winner in my book when you select the recording format and encoding or resolution wav bit and resolution mp bit rate etc each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card i also love that it uses full size sd cards microsd can be used with an adapter of course they re much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinky nail sized micros i ll update this review after i ve had some more time with it
454	put a set of these on my rogue grand concert now the guitar stays in tune beautifully worth every penny good price and sound classic behringer plastic housing i haven t had a problem with ever but i don t dog my stuff favor this over built in analog drives nicer crunch and dirt that s flexible fair to say real tube is the best but for analog and practice amps this does put some life in the tone can t say for metal as i m not so into but everything else find this fits the bill this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as i m concerned it s true bypass brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage accurate small footprint durable powers all your other pedals and is under especially if bought used its virtues are many and varied if you ve been using a cheap crappy tuner like i was you ll notice the difference all the more if you want a hyper accurate tuner for some kind of technical work the pitchblack s tolerances might not be quite what you re looking for but as far as stage tuners go it s got a tighter tolerance than the boss stompbox if you want a buffer in your chain this pedal won t supply it as it is true bypass if you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune this is not the pedal for you the output is muted while the tuner is engaged i prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune so for me this is a non issue plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch these are the only circumstances i can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a pitchblack right this instant edit after some time with this pedal i ve noticed that when used to power other pedals some of them don t like being daisy chained from this pedal s power output most notably tremolos but when the daisy chain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the pitchblack is powered like any other pedal the problem vanishes kind of strange and i figured worth noting here but i don t consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less not my first intellitouch tuner i really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar i did not think that an amp this size would sound good boy was i surprized this amp out does my old roland cube this amp is loud very loud and the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound all in all a super amp
455	i rated it at stars because stars means i love it in amazon s selection of things i do love it in fact i think it is better than my sans amp bass di which costs more don t get me wrong the sans amp is still great i just find this easier to dial in it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp the only down side is that it doesn t come with an ac power adapter that isn t a problem for me since i have many power options on my pedal boards this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals if you have been playing bass for a while you know that no matter how good your bass rig is you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your amp that being said i am in my s and i play mostly guitar hero music like robin trower srv hendrix yes rush and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc the fun old rock n roll stuff like the sans amp putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple the tone that i love to dial in is that old piece rock band sound from years past think of mel from grand funk railroad or old james gang in the joe walsh days johnny winter and the cream that over driven cranked ampeg or fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a piece power band i am running this into an ampeg bass combo and i have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous playing bass is a side gig for me since i am mainly a lead guitarist i let my bassist try it he also uses a sans amp bass di at our gigs and he immediately went online and purchased one he is another cool use for this pedal if you are a guitarist put it in front of your guitar amp the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible try it excellent strap for the money the leather is thick and supple in fact the materials are so thick that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup a note about length some might find the standard levy s strap length too short so be aware what you need and note there are xl versions of these for me many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me including those from franklin dunlop bmf wide and mono even the short model was about an inch too long i m a bass player and when standing i prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height a few basses i prefer higher i d suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable measure button hole to button hole and be sure you re ordering the right length i couldn t believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable velvety cushioning inside heavy duty outside and a little compartment for picks or capos i can t fit much else in there but i don t really need to a few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze at first i didn t think my ibanez mandolin fit in here but when i finally applied some pressure it went right in now that i ve been using the case for a while it seems broken in and i don t have to fight it so much to get it to close the only downside is that after a few uses the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge i used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it s on the bottom it s not very noticeable but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through i didn t take a star away for that as it s purely cosmetic and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin i can forgive some tape on the edge in this case i still got more than my money s worth
456	some people are not comfortable using the drywall anchors that are included with this hanger if the drywall anchors are installed correctly you will have no worries about it pulling out of the drywall i have used these drywall anchors for years now to hang heavy wood blinds which are raised and lowered daily without anchor failure concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger the only options are the drywall anchors they are good to go the planet waves capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did i tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other capos i used this capo on a gibson j hummingbird and a j i played it finger style and strummed with a pick the device is very well made and really looks like the best capo i own however the sound left something to be desired there was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless unless i really cranked down on the adjustment then is was still dull but passable it was a little better on electrics i tried it on a les paul and a telecaster it was ok but not the best of the bunch i do like the built in pick holder to compare this i tried a g capo kaiser and schubb frankly the only one i really am happy with is the schubb i m mainly a guitarist but i do play bass from time to time on an old fender american these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound i love the tone you get out of these very bluesy and the punch isn t too rough it s just right i m a huge fan of d addario been using their strings for at least years and they never disappoint give these a try if you re looking for some new strings i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference the nyxl s have a brighter tone good playing ease and stay in tune better when making new string changes if you have a mahogany body guitar such as the les paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies these are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are pertaining to output i am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in acoustic unamplified output but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears these do stay in tune better than my usual ernie balls nickels when you first put them on the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference i find that by lightly sanding the nut with grit paper and using big ben s nut sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other having these nyxl s on there is just one more added benefit i would say if you are looking for a brighter tone with better tuning stability these are the ones to have you can tell from the wall to wall star reviews these are the one to have i ordered this for my husband the musician he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel he would definitely purchase this product and he s pretty picky about his guitar strings
457	i like it grip is good and the thickness is just right for me i wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is shipped in time just what i have expected looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars easy to screw it on the wall well here s what i have to say this strap is much shorter than im used to but seeing how i bought this for an off guitar that s ok they really should put the length in the description the length is max where i like my straps to be max it is a hard strap to get on the guitar i do not suggest getting this strap withdunlop dual design straplok system nickel these are great locks but almost impossible to install on this strap overall great buy for a cheap little money saver i initially wanted a yamaha pacifica dlx guitar center in eugene claimed to have stock in website but when i reached there there wasn t any so i tested an affinity and a bullet hss instead and thought the bullet was pretty ok but they did not have the color i wanted so i ordered through amazon but i bought a microcube from guitar center as i m greatful for the opportunity to test guitars i waited for weeks before i make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression i received the guitar in perfect condition it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors just a few words squier by fender new strings and scratch free made in china it says however it did not have sharp frets like i experience with some bucks guitarsthe action came very high and i had intended to return it but the guitar was perfect and i couldn t find any fault to return so i proceed to setup the guitar through long and painful steps straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod then measured the string action height and set it from mm for the first strings and mm for the last strings setup the intonation using a tuner you really need a tuner for this step after that the guitar was splendid it did go out of tune in or days but stabilized after that i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning after weeks i m still loving the guitar beginners be warned you may like the action or may need to do setup like i did in fact i m so impressed with squier that i m thinking of getting the squier standard strat next pretty curious of the alnico pups latest review downgraded from to stars i bought a washburn rx with duncan usm the bullet is nice but i outgrew it the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive the bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings tusq nut locking the trem down etc i d recommend to save some money and buy something above guitars at that price may be twice the cost but is more than twice better the important things are not in bullet the sustain and the sound latest review the product is back at stars i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short like attack finger plucking excellent for a serious youngster learning to play priced right the thirteen year old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well
458	whatever good things you ve heard about the at is probably true well unless if you ve heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky but it sounds great when your recording songs haha i record with fl studio and it s even great so far i recommend you get this this little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such but don t expect it to last forever as is typical with behringer products at least it s cheap though i just wish it had a power switch ordered this and two cables this came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit i recommend i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano i have a pro model with xlr outs to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces works every time balanced signal is so much better no more issues with ground loops or other problems just clear as a bell they were cheap and the build quality is fine
459	works as described for the price i have no complaints at all clamps firmly and easily doesn t move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic fyi parchment is slightly off white unless you re comparing right next to a pure white pickguard you probably would think they re simply white i ll start this by saying i prefer metal slides to glass tone snob that i am so i wasn t too excited about playing with this until i played with it the tone is amazing great highs amazing lows smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics i now only use metal slides and my dunlop bottleneck these work just fine as replacement mounting screws for single coil pickups mounted to a pickguard though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker nothing that a little drilling out couldn t fix if you re so inclined might be my abusive bends though i ll try a ticker gauge next time other than that great strings
460	i bought a hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case i decided to take it anywhere the prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times i have other guitars and they all have cases and i might never actually take this guitar anywhere so i didn twant to spend a lot price was a big issue the guitar fits great the bag is well padded and i can t believe the price so i ordered this to learn to play the banjo because of the price and good reviews it was delivered yesterday and the first thing i noticed was that the neck was loose and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board i looked to make sure it wasn t warped or cracked and it wasn t so i scoured the internet to find my problem and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot so i took the resonator off and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body and naturally that scared me but i tightened the metal rod and it brought the neck down to the body and brought the strings down to the perfect height now it s a very beautiful instrument and it sounds pretty good too granted it s not a gold tone or what have you but it sounds at least like a banjo that costs x this much the only thing i would change is the tuning pegs as they are made out of a cheap plastic they don t feel like they will break any time soon though i just prefer metal tuning pegs the part that holds the strings is still metal i m talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plastic so i m debating on rating it stars or stars i d rate it because of the scare it gave me at first but i think i ll rate it stars because of it s looks sound and price yes the reviews are right guys don t be skeptical but be warned that you may have to do a little tlc on it as i did with the neck no worries though now i m learning my new favorite instrument also the strings that came on it are pretty decent but new strings sound a bit better bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase as a guitarist i lose and find picks everywhere i hate buying them because i know they are somewhere in my house but i just can t find them with this i take all my old credit cards student id cards playing cards etc and make my own i now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me it rocks pun intended bottom line every guitarist should have one no excuses returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it not durable spend a few more dollars it is worth it
461	monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time you cant go wrong with monster cables these are really great guitar locks i use them on all my guitars and i would highly recommend them to anyone so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors guitar sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great this has the largest top of any of my stands and it is the one i use when traveling gigs the top doesn t fold like some of the more expensive stagg hercules stands so if you re using it for gigging that may be something to consider i have to lug an key weighted piano around so don t mind lugging this defiantly a space saver i can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables it s very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits my only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much this tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding but it is not very good at parties it cannot compete with the noise level that people in conversation can make it is cheap so you should just get one i am having great fun experimenting around with different settings instruments and power feed voltage levels see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool light construction but you get what you pay for so far it has functioned well and i do use it a lot it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you i mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments i have not noticed any sound degradation from using it the volume knobs are handy for sure neither delighted nor disappointed i have not found it to be intuitive to use and the battery compartment is a joke but otherwise the construction is good i dont use it very much because i havent really figured out what i want to do with it and it is too big to fit in my briefcase full of blues harps so i have the behringer a b switch doing the job there this cable is quality no crackling strong connections and hard metal maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable an old school delay that works very well simple to use adjustments for intensity and length uses v batt or power adaptor reasonably priced with how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky even for a right angle but they still sound good is this guraunteed for life or something it should be for the price it is very basic tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up i would not buy another one at the prices they charge but then i am handy enough to make my own if i wanted to the carry bag is very nice the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff they show a lot more pedals than i could fit on it they must be smaller pedals than the ones i can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between if you look at the picture there appears to room for pedals but is all you will get i have a boss rx double pedal looper and other boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables i love thes i keep buying them for every instrument i have so i am never with out it
462	i own numerous behringer products and have never had an issue with any of them this item is well worth the money and the sound is awsome which is what you want who cares if it is plastic i own a behringer x v amp guitar multi effects pedal and when i first plugged into it the quality of the amp models blew me away to the guy who said he received one with stripped out screws and to not even think about stepping on the pedal dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with you should have been bright enough to just return it and ask for a replacement second these are musical instruments you aren t supposed to stomp on them like you are trying to crush them and grind them into the stage or where ever you play the term stomp box isn t supposed to be taken literally it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot erego the word stomp i ve read some complaints about this unit maybe those folksshould shell out an additional for something better to the rest of you with the storage units this is a great tool my band i to be exact uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track i just loaded the whole pre recorded track into a slot or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background i loadedthe effect into a slot or another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need butdon t have someone else to play it you can play it back using this device
463	i got this pedal recently all in all it s a pretty nice device expecially for the price seems solid and well made it has a nice big pedal for big feet it works smoothly i have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal my only gripe is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal v battery or a v plug in power supply why the difference the really bad part for me is that i bought this to install in a newly purchased behringer pedal board which comes with a v power supply so in order for me to use this pedal in the board i will have to run two different power supplies or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard s power supply behringer this was not thought out very well i m now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle bottom line the pedal itself is great but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you one final note about behringer they seem to get bad marks now and then i really don t understand why i have two behringer amps two of their stomp boxes the above mentioned pedal board and the volume pedal just discussed i really like all of them i have never had any problem with any of these items they perform well are well made and certainly all came at a reasonable price behringer s full range of products is so extensive that i see little reason to buy any other brand i m sticking with them not high quality but definitely useable and worth the bucks ends are not too bad and it works for what it is the product is great a lot of nice features i am running it through a little cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion if you havethe amp overdriven then the loop comes out that way too and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellation trying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what you re trying to play over great pedal but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through i ve got three of these to hold an acoustic a mini strat and a jazzmaster while i had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former i was somewhat leary about the later it s quite a bit heavier than the other two but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart i have been trusting it do not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full size electric and i have my doubts about those plugs the hanger will hold but the drywall might not get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument i used a different setup philips slotted round heads would have actually been better to fix them to a nice piece of x x pine and screwed that into the studs with some screws needless to say it s not going anywhere as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall ok one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a jazzmaster
464	makes changing strings a whole lot easier if you are a guitar player and are changing strings like i was without one of these stop and get one trust me the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal do i use it yes however i would likely trade it for an mxr or dunlop if i had the opportunity it doesn t sound bad per se but does have some hiss to it it also boosts your signal a noticeable volume increase while some may like this i want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain this product isn t really one to review but it does what it advertises i use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my tu great tuner by the way starting to build my pedal board so i figured better to start off with a dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a t rex fuel tank which i m planing on in the future great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks can t beat it this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended
465	i ve had these on my yamaha apx for a while now and they sound really good a tad brighter than i like but that s just the nature of the lightness of the strings it s real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings i try in fact i ve had these strings on for over months now and they still feel and sound good this capo is one of the best made i ve seen it fits the neck of my electric guitar perfectly and stays securely at any position very well constructed easy to attach detach a couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and i ve never had cause to remove it at first i thought i d hate the look of it there but it s never bothered me one bit reaching for pics is never a problem i just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz iii pics this one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz ii i have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz iii in it works out so not too much a big deal i have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these planet wave picks are much nicer than the others they are clean cut smooth finish nice texture and looking i reach for these first would and will buy again and recommend i have two of them one in the guitar case holding my martin hd and the other in the case of my blueridge flattop just clip it on about the nut and tune away pickers playing next to me don t interfere with me tuning works great
466	i plugged in the amp and i plugged in the bass and there were no issues with the wire this is one of those products you don t want to overly notice and in that it has done the job is is designed for i only needed one i haven t use it but i m sure it s going to work well this is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on top ffsalsa these nandy mics are great entry level mics if you are looking not spend to much cash they have a long range and great sound fidelity if you are trying to save on your budget these are great if money is not an option keep on looking the cable is good and normal good price and works well the rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and i have to push them in place all too often these are durable but i get some noise from the cables it s barely audible but it s distracting nonetheless
467	does the job well enough all i can say is you should try a set of these elixir nanoweb bronze acoustic guitar strings for yourself you will not want to go back to any other set of strings i ve been using elixir strings for many years they have better feel sound and last longer than all other brands i ve used playing guitar elixir has excellent quality control too i ve never had a problem these are perfect hard to beat strings they last keep in tune and keep their tone they don t need any string cleaners either so you can save money on that an obvious noticeable difference between the medium gauge and the light is that these medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger pick a lot but boy are they bright enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees the on stage xcg tubular guitar stand is a decent quality simple guitar stand like almost all the others so here is how i rated it there are really high quality stand of the same design but i will not use those stands as a comparison seriously the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt if you somehow made one that retails for over and are able to sell it i applaud your marketing team continuing on this is how i rated the on stage xcg if it were over it would have gotten stars between and earns it stars if it were under it would have gotten stars i hope this helps jp s the currency is in us dollars please adjust accordingly when i purchased this i d seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar guess what as far as i can tell there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with this is not worth the money i normally use dunlop s mm nylon picks but decided to give the mm max grips a try when the price dropped to for a dozen the top half of the max grips have a special surface with tiny ridges that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip the feeling is a little strange at first but you should get used to it quickly i like the feel and playability of the mm max grip s but they are little more flexible than i prefer so if i were to get another set i would get a thicker type either mmor mm
468	this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries we ve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it we are using an mp player for backup the sound is not quite as clear as we get with our roland cm so only stars from me the micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it s nice not to have to load up cart to roll around guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features this is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich three knobs volume tone and gain give it a little versatility runs forever on a nine volt battery i keep mine next to the couch so i can always plug in and have some fun it s small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to be overall a great little deal for the price stop waiting and grab one you can t go wrong this orange micro crush amp lives up to it s name it s little bitty about a third the size of the roland micro cube but it s plenty loud surprisingly loud really it s amazing that much sound comes out of that thing of course it doesn t have all the bells and whistles of the micro cube it s basically got a clean channel an overdrive channel and a tuner then a volume knob a tone knob and that s it the over drive gives a good sound but i like to run pedals through it anyway it s missing reverb which i would like to have but it s far from a deal breaker i have no issues with the build quality it feels solid as a rock of course it s size and trademark orange color make it look like a toy it s definitely a capable little amp definitely a keeper i much prefer curly cable as they keep the slack up off the floor and help prevent nasty little tumbles and equipment spills due to general clumsiness these cables are no different they may not be the nicest looking cables ever but for this price you can t shake a stick at it the connectors are injection molded so theres no easy unscrew and re solder when the time comes but hey for a budget curly cable i am not complaining i ll just nip the ends off if i need to replace them later the cable seems to be of good quality i m guessing it s about gauge wire and has a nice bounciness to it i have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so it s probably fairly well shielded with the right angled jack on one end it ensures a low profile so i don t easily kick the cable out of the pedal and will probably help it last longer with the reduced cable strain on that end that s more than i thought i had to say about a cheap but good cable
469	what can i really say tunes my entire arsenal from cigar box guitar string strummers tacoma papoose andmy brand new laguna string getting ready to make few uke s and it will tune them also need a all n one tuner buy this or an i phone the korg is the perfecttuner spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth shines nice and doesn t leave it feeling oily sticky smells nice and makes your guitar looking new with the exception of the mc classical fender has upped the quality of every low end guitar it s associated with the latest bargain basement squier strat bullet is no exception as other reviewers have indicated a squier bullet straight from the box is ready to give guitars several times its street value full on competition but why stop there if you ve read some of my other reviews you know i m a serial hot rodder and this is my favorite victim why because it s such a sound platform to begin with pun intended the basic stuff on the bullet is very good and for many it s all that s required but let s quest after some serious big league sound the first things to upgrade are the pickups the standard ceramic magnet squier pickups do yeoman s work but they re wonderfully eclipsed by top drawer pickups from lace and seymour duncan my favorites a lace red dually bridge with a single lace hot gold parked half way between the middle and neck positions the lace hot gold value pack with a hot gold hot bridge pickup and the lace patriot red silver and blue value pack you simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it and all you need to find out is a phillips screwdriver a cheap soldering iron some low temperature solder a pair of wire cutters option youtube how to videos and some patience but wait a minute hold the phone what about the stock pick guard please memorize this chandler guitar s pickguard heaven better yet google it they re wonderful folks and they do excellently affordable work with a custom pick guard virtually anything is possible e g how about a seymour duncan dimebucker bridge the next thing to do is to block the tremolo whammy mechanism proper vibrato comes from the fingers period a small piece of oak from home depot carefully whittled not for the guitar s sake but for your finger s can be easily wedged between the guitar body and the die cast tremolo string carrier by removing and eventually replacing six phillips screws on the back of your strat hey now you re eric clapton if you want bold as brass sound the stock plastic nut can be replaced with a brass strat nut a bit of careful filing and a tiny touch of epoxy or gorilla glue why bother a more forward lead guitar sound if you play rhythm don t bother finally if you re a monster about precise tuning and have basic woodworking skills the very good stock tuners can be replaced with state of the art six inline tuners from several manufacturers note well most folks will be more than well served by the stock tuners so what s then point of all this for the price of one genuine american strat which is a very nice ride if you can afford it you can have three or four arguably equally excellent squier bullets with a diverse mix of pickups and resulting sounds made of leather or high quality pleather so it seems built to last i use it on my seagull and it totally works great i would definitely recommend but it s kind of expensive for what it is
470	this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says it distorts you want something to make your guitar sound like junk this will do it why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use boutique and distortion are an oxymoron these things are built with heavy metal it should last i kinda hope it doesn t just kidding you want distortion you got distortion this is the best little guitar pedal adapter i ve used and i ve used many over the last three decades it s exceptionally quiet which many are not and it puts out volts which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery and you won t have to buy a new one every dozen hours i ve used this on a splitter to drive three pedals but at four and up i can hear the current drop a bit still that s a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers not a box on the floor but it sure is nice to have some gilmouresque delay and a little extra gain driving the tubes and this is the best v adapter for pedals available that i know of including the boss ones dan has released some cool well made pedals in the past years and this little wall wart is a worthy companion a very good deal at clams purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use distilled water will extend the life of the sponge overall simple and effective however i may have added too much humidity was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity but i then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case i do use a hydrometer but i don t think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar but only the inside of the case so i think the planet waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it after trying about every comp out there for years i came across this i have a wampler ego compressor too it is the same quality as the ego compressor better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me i see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts much more fun than a black box i own one of each model
471	these are nice and sturdy picks they sound real clean i m having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics no messing around fits well in bass tuner knobs spins well and the cutter is good this is the one to get not onlh are these good for the price but they have become my new fave i switch acoustic strings times a month on my main guitars i gig times a month these last long without compromising the tone great price too i tried every brand until i got to these not sure why i did not try them earlier probably because i was drinking the elixir koolaide i have owned my g th capo over a year now as far as i m concerned it beats all the others i ve owned in the past hands down so easy to use can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed i m raising my rating and the result getting demoted from the front page in any case even though i recently picked up the sony pcm d from amazon i m sufficiently impressed by the zoom h to give it stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders for quite a while its only competition was the edirol r but as the price has come down the zoom h stands out from its immediate competition currently the h is my back up unit but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed production values haven t been spared in terms of the packaging the included equipment no batteries but a power adapter protective pouch handy table stand mic stand adapter wind screen ear buds usb cable and a mb sd card and the manual a quick set up sheet plus an ample booklet with generous sized print written in clear idiomatic english that makes some of sony s recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparison the screen and controls admittedly are minuscule requiring sharp eyes though the screen is well illuminated and nimble fingers i much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my sony to the touch pad of the zoom what s encouraging about this recorder apart from the price is that the designers at zoom have made the h with the genuine audiophile and or all around musician in mind it s not simply another guitar player s gadget loaded down with an endless supply of effects loops rhythm and bass tracks files within files programs buried within programs the h unlike my pricey sony can handle both wav and mp protocol has microphone fields ranging from degrees to degrees is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures conversations solo performers and orchestras in short the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or more and in a practical digital storage card format other pluses although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by sony costing and respectively the zoom onboard mic actually is darn good it captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clock s chimes from upstairs and it s reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past a single tiny hole is more common these days getting the recorded signal onto a computer s hard drive is expedited with the included usb cable and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like cool edit which i strongly recommend over editing in the recorder there s also a metronome on board potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions and a tuner useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recording possible drawbacks zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistles limiters compressors cut off levels agc control auto dynamic levels sensitivity ratios panning effects and the list goes on it s too easy to miss a step to waste precious time fumbling with the menu to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments moreover the instructions while clear and abundant omit much information that would help the beginner the hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone who s a complete newbie to someone who s a knowledgeable aficionado and i have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screen s menu to get to a metronome or tuner frankly with kids squirming in their seats i d go to the old single function dial up block shaped metronome without a second thought the h is so light that using it with the ac adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely undoubtedly you ll want to pick up a to gb sd card and a good supply of double a batteries it takes only to record in the field at standard mp meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours the adaptor would have made more sense if zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder my h would not connect to my imac with osx leopard without downloading an upgrade from the zoom site after having some difficulty with the install i decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in real time what s encouraging about this recorder apart from the price of the h of the edirol r is that the designers at zoom have made the h with the genuine audiophile and or all around musician in mind perhaps the primary deal maker or breaker the tiny screen and small controls until mastering the miniaturization i would want to have a back up cassette recorder for any performance that i judged of special importance as for build quality my h is like new after almost months use undoubtedly you ll want to pick up a to gb sd card and a good supply of double a batteries it takes to record in the field at standard mp meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours the adaptor would have made more sense if zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder my h would not connect to my imac with osx leopard without downloading an upgrade from the zoom site after having some difficulty with the install i decided to forget about it especially after seeing how slow i mean really overnight slow the machine is in normalizing a long file or converting it from wav to mp what takes minutes with a software program like sound studio or wiretap studio requires hours when you re using the zoom as a computer interface use it for what it does best namely produce realistic audio from a tiny weightless durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame its expensive rivals i m taking my korg ca which has no backlight slow reset time and a ridiculous stand feature put a business card in the slot in the back and try to find a level surface for it to stand upon and putting it in my sock drawer with my decades old guitar pitch pipe also going in there is my intellitouch tuner which drives me nuts with the arrows and does not fit securely on my fiddle for my fiddle mandolin and guitar i ll use my just received intelli imt which is very compact great for fiddle mando cases which has an outstanding backlight superb accuracy and quick resetting the intelli in its own manufacturers box which has no shock absorbing material was placed in a larger shipping box by the distributor seller the instrument store without any shock absorbing material leaving the intelli a very sensitive electronic metering device subject to vibration and shock during the long trip down the east coast it would be good for amazon to teach sellers the basics of proper packing for shipping it s not rocket science although this light is a little pricey in my opinion it really gets the job done i do like the fact that you can use batteries or a cadapter to power the light the nine led s really light up my music stand the carrying case that comes with it is well made makestransportation keeping it stored easy r joyner i own at least of these i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too i have the snark but read that this was the best so far i got and agreethis works better i would recommend it to anyone
472	stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time these hangers are easy to install just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business the stringed instrument becomes easily accessible and safe i got two of these but wish i had got better ones using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical i like ernie ball strings they are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands i tried i change strings every two weeks i tried the rest and returned to the best this is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers
473	looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position i bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs the same heads i bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven t torn these heads are amazing and a very good investment make your kit sound very professional and i just love em to death definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads i am a tone freak i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff at the time i had never owned a big muff i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff the difference was huge the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space i love guitar picks i have tested alot of them and this is by far the best one that i have found yet they are perfect to hold and very tough although i do wear through them quickly but i do that to all picks sounded good warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac i rocked all night and loved the sound next day i turned it on my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock id like to see a real set of jjs im sure one of them was a dud
474	i got these for a custom les paul string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use i had never used strap locks before and don t think i will again the only reason i m not giving this one star is that i didn t expect much for such a low cost pedal i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals we have a punk ska band think suicide machines sublime and need to switch a lot in all our songs i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile nope this pedal sucks your guitar s tone and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going and its not a pleasant sound either way avoid just picked up the korg pitch black from guitar center yesterday i use a snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise love the thing so far its accurate fast fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price i like the multiple display options and calibrations mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe great buy i am happy with it i got it in red use them all the time has velcro too goes from my di or preamp to my audio interface good quality bought this for a friend cheap plastic enclosure affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay he tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay stay away from this one and get a better used pedal i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day the band s on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this to rehearse that long for this one show it s a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts with jason doing so well it was possible i could easily imagine ny sf rio paris rom tokyo etc
475	this is a great music stand very solid feel no need to over tighten the adjusters it holds my heaviest books without tipping over what can i say it s a cable it s cheap and it works as advertised much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops gold tips yeah right this is a really cheap microphone i m usually amazed how good cheap mics sound e g the shure pg line is fantastic but i m not amazed by this mic it sounds like a cheap mic it handles high sound pressure ok but sounds tinny and is more prone to feedback than a nicer mic for the price however you should not expect any better likes price this is essentially a toy stand and cable too dislikes sound quality maybe you want a lo fi sound you could make it work overall this is a really good bargain for an extra back up or kids mic it is not a horrible mic it is usable for applications like speaking for hi fi music recording however you ll notice it is a cheap mic ok i don t have much to say just i love it because its cheap nice and i don t know i just feel happy to buy this product
476	great picks buy it this pick rocks for me im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing i hope there had been a closer picture of the product i was a little surprised when i got it because it doesn t look as great as i imagined the white lightning is stamped on the black strap the same goes for the gibson name on the end of it maybe it will get better looking in the long run been using these cables for three months now i use them with azoom g n guitar multi effects pedaland they sound great decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research i found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time they have a good lenght of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you ll be playing so far i ve only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig i ve got coming up the end of the month this was a filler item for a much larger order i am very interested in the straplocks so i decided to give them a try i sincerely like the concept
477	i bought this little pedal back in about a year after i got my first guitar i ve tried other pedals but ultimately this one gives me the best sound it s very versatile and it s really easy to dial in just about any sound i want you might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units but for cost and practicality this pedal is your best bet the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position but i stand in front of a mic on stage the pedal generates a lot of noise so i can t use it you get what you pay for king vox and dunlop high gain both passive have passed the test and i m pretty picky i have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a cable these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others and they work great no loss of tone through these cables if anything i had to do some eq adjusting because after using these i had a far greater signal volume and frequency response when i replaced my other patch cables with these i love them great pedall for the money it makes ur pedalls real quaiet it does what its soupose to german mind great electronics well made but plastic i bought this audio cable and all i gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble good stuff
478	fits the behringer xm perfectly it actually dampens the sound giving better a more smoother sound and reducing harsh parts of vocals it s really hard to beat this product for the price i found it sturdy well built and a great fit for my guitar i really appreciate the low wide stance which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself i d give this and a half stars if i could this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch move a cable plugged into it it is so hard to get full sound in head earphones with this i can only hear in one ear in every headphone output and hardly anything in the other i have to always adjust my cable s connector to get any full sound for a second i can still use this but hardly i really don t like this i use this all the time it s pretty basic but really good for a beginner not all chords are in here but the core chords are worth the price i got this yesterday and everything was alright except that two of the three mics worked one was dead i tested all three of them with the same and different cable and made sure that the the on off switch was on it was first mic i tested of the three and the dead one of the three everything was good except for that one microphone great microphone at a very good rice i purchased this item sometime in august and think it s pretty good i have not had any problems with it not that i can remember pretty simple it does what it s supposed to do
479	this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genz benz bass amplification company andy said that this product is far superior to any other he was right fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle amp also fixed the effects loop jacks which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose of its power on gigs not good after several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating cleaning and coating effect on the components wow and no andy does not own stock in have affiliation with or represent in any way the manufacturers of de oxit nor do i i could not beat the price the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal it is well build and i can use it on other boss and roland gear also it not to big it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board very happy with this item i needed a solid throne to replace my ikea computer stool i ve been saddled with for the past year the stool is heavy easy to assemble and works as it should i don t have any long term usage to report but i ve seen reviews complaining the stool eventually loosens and will rotate which would be annoying if true but at this fairly low price point you can t complain about much and it s better than the real cheap thrones very nice metronome with just enough features in particular i love the name based tempos displayed on the face many metronomes do not have that feature sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks also with my win x machine i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware sending and receiving midi pc and midi cc as well as transmitting midi clock in and out i simply couldn t get this to work most of the time active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely in contrast i purchased the mu s xmidi x tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it i should have totally returned this product instead it s in a landfill thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs the pedal responds well to the guitar s volume and easily replaces my holy fire custom badass od and every other od i have how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me just buy it
480	real nice guitar picks it came in a piece pack they deserve the dunlop brandname because these things last a long time these things are great no more twisting for mins per string no more running around the house looking for a pair of clippers for the price its definitely worth it imho it is really the best pick holder i ever had i can put picks on it it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend look at the price because this thing really sounds good it s no toy it s a real retro electric guitar effects pedal i m very happy with this purchase believe this feet cable is no small thing the jacks are high quality construction very very durable the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years i m glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available it was my fault not to check out it s measurements before purchase but it s not the reason why i drop by one star the reason is it s not designed properly since people stand and sing this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than feet i m i can barely reach the microphone when i stand still also it s way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a pc mic as a result i feel i m either too tall or too short build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten overall a four stars product imo
481	i like the wide for my bass fits nice and made well seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick the cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth just feels right for the job since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because i m a beginner and don t have much calais yet also i like the first day of new strings look shiny i would recommend this to any beginner i like everything about this mike except one no gain adjustment on the mike you have to do it from the software that was a big disappointment because i had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustment of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably won t care but if you are recording instruments particularly loud instruments you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps
482	not much to write about here but it does exactly what it s supposed to filters out the pop sounds now my recordings are much more crisp it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it they honestly work the same despite their pricing nice looking gooseneck threads are clean fits well however the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic shure sm without collapsing better try another brand or spend a buck or two more to get a better product i buy many of these cable and they all test correctly with a meter and they all work great so far i haven t had any issues at all they feel well made and i will continue to use them for the bands pa this cable is an amazing find it simply works i am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them but the cable i received is perfect i plugged the cable into my windows laptop waited seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers and i was good to go i plugged in a dynamic microphone opened the audacity software program hit record and it was amazing sound quality i had previously used a variety of input devices from a jamhub to a behringer usb line input device to an art audio preamp to even going low budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the thinkpad laptop this cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device i have used there are however a few limitations this cable is mono only i e not for stereo recording this seems obvious but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff this cable only works with dynamic microphones if your microphone is a condenser microphone you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of phantom power source to power the condenser microphone the really good things this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software some input devices are either very hot too much level or have hardly any gain at all so this cable works very well by providing just the right level this cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar acoustic electric guitar keyboard etc i have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them i was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record using just this cable and a hosa www amazon com gp product b ws q e direct box i purchased from amazon as well but works well i have a different brand which has a string and small hook but i find when adjusted correctly i cannot remove it this sling keeps the head loop large so you can get it off without a binch of hassle i find the hook to be wide though and could be alot better with a thinner hook
483	i was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my fostex mr recorder and did a little research on the xenyx just looking at it with it s inputs number of controls i would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks imagine my surprise when after reading the positive reviews that i discovered this thing was only i bought it immediately and right out of the box it did exactly everything i was expecting it to this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the fostex i m quite excited about my future recordings using the i m like a kid with a new toy highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost excellent quality and craftsmanship i was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do i figured it would be made out of a cheap feeling metal i was wrong it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe it is strong to it feels like i could really bang it i won t and it would not break i use this with an audio technica at which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still it does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk or whatever that will still come through it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters i am very pleased with this purchase hey it s a fun little toy but i ve seen this thing going in most places for an even which is ridiculous i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust i ve made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it s not one of those tools you ll use every song unless you re so amazing you can make it work every song learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun but once you get it and you re over it you wonder why you wasted on something that shouldn t have cost more than it s essentially a v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light this was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when i had nothing better to use my money on works exceptionally well in fact this works better than regular single layered pop filters i have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice well worth the money the build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands
484	i used this on a string bass i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it her reason for her opinion is simple this stuff puts out a lot more oil or whatever it is than you would think this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard earned callouses soft which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast and did for my friend to apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string one string at a time i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string at first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard that s ok you will need to wipe away the excess and i m telling you if you accidentally get too much that excess oil may not come off easily didn t for me at least mine left little pools of oil between the frets and i only used one swipe and thought i had just a little on there naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling my friend hated that part too and i agree with her soft callouses no callouses this is a good product idea and i like it in theory and with my thick bass strings i didn t have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you it does what it says but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers this cloth works well in cleaning off the dust fingerprints oil and dirt off of my guitar it is thicker and bigger than the ones used with glasses cleaning so i m sure it can be used to wipe down other things as well strung these up on a seagull guitar to replace some strings that were several years old and the gauge and action of the guitar killed my fingers so it didn t get played much these strings feel great and sound fantastic very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows i bought a glaesel bridge this glaesel rubber mute together i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews the mute fits the bridge fine but compared to a brass mute which of course works very well this mute seems to do absolutely nothing there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on also the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly as many of us do i suggest you buy something else this item does not work and is a total waste of money i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon fyi that cheap little electric violin is an awesome fun item just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley aglaesel self adjusting violin bridge mediumwith it i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all it does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way a real workhorse for sure not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars i also have the guitar one which is incredibly big almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it i use this item for my daughter size guitar its looks light in weight and firm and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars for its hard to say anything bad about this gadget it s accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument the visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that s a silly extra that doesn t interfere with anything so no problem
485	once i switched to these cables i never use anything else now great connection sounds good and no issues at all good quality but not as nice as some pricier ones if i want better i would shop around and pay more does the job for now i initially wanted a yamaha pacifica dlx guitar center in eugene claimed to have stock in website but when i reached there there wasn t any so i tested an affinity and a bullet hss instead and thought the bullet was pretty ok but they did not have the color i wanted so i ordered through amazon but i bought a microcube from guitar center as i m greatful for the opportunity to test guitars i waited for weeks before i make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression i received the guitar in perfect condition it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors just a few words squier by fender new strings and scratch free made in china it says however it did not have sharp frets like i experience with some bucks guitarsthe action came very high and i had intended to return it but the guitar was perfect and i couldn t find any fault to return so i proceed to setup the guitar through long and painful steps straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod then measured the string action height and set it from mm for the first strings and mm for the last strings setup the intonation using a tuner you really need a tuner for this step after that the guitar was splendid it did go out of tune in or days but stabilized after that i do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning after weeks i m still loving the guitar beginners be warned you may like the action or may need to do setup like i did in fact i m so impressed with squier that i m thinking of getting the squier standard strat next pretty curious of the alnico pups latest review downgraded from to stars i bought a washburn rx with duncan usm the bullet is nice but i outgrew it the tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive the bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings tusq nut locking the trem down etc i d recommend to save some money and buy something above guitars at that price may be twice the cost but is more than twice better the important things are not in bullet the sustain and the sound latest review the product is back at stars i got the sustain to improve by increasing the action fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short there some sounds that a strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short like attack finger plucking i chose this capo because i was just starting out and needed one for certain songs this was a cheap capo but it does its job well i have no complaints about it at all after registering the amp online or by mail you have access to backing tunes with either drums or drums and bassline you are able to select from different genres such as rock blues country alternative and more along with this great feature you can also take free lessons from beginner to advanced you can even get custom settings giving you the sound of such great bands as green day the beatles led zeppelin and many more along with lessons tabs and the ability to loop any jam track spider online adds more than even i immagined to this awesome amp if you re still hesitant about buying this or any other spider amp just buy it i personally guarantee your satisfaction buy it no seriously are you buying it
486	i ve owned the same one for years and it s still going strong after many gigs the spring tension is just right the thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one no pun intended you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice i ve used many different types of picks over the years and i ve not found the ideal one for me until recently when i decided to use a silverpick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which i find fits my needs the best and so far it s just a case of getting used to it this particular dunlop pick is as described being fat stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face the hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard this makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing for me though i ll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it s not my default or preferred choice for play i ve been playing guitar for over twenty years now and i ve tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these elixir coated strings i ve come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it eventually all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn t make any sense if you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what i do is i get the least expensive ones and make sure i wipe down and clean them even using products like string cleaners and fast fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the u s and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names granted elixir probably isn t one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price i myself use generic kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and memphis electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest i could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way in fact you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings at least most people would be able to hear the difference don t get me wrong these elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique practice getting better cables pickups amps guitars etc than from just using these strings for better string life just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use this discipline once a habit is good enough peace this is by far the best delay effects box i ve ever used and it has so much potential that it ll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers it s also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end it is built like a tank and doesn t take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very user friendly pedal wish all pedals were built this way highly recommended
487	i love the tortex mm picks red i have one that s over years old and still going strong yes the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings i use the red yellow and orange tortex s exclusively for practice and performance i m a church worship leader my highest recommendation this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra great buy this is my thrid levy s strap and it is as good as the rest of them that i have had for a few years i have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others i have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but i don t see a problem with it so far and i use it regularly i have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer but it is a standard size i prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials for the price the strap works well and i would buy more levy s straps if needed excellent price excellent tuner with one flaw using it couldn t be simpler and it has excellent contrast i would say it was the best clip on tuner i ve had a chance to use except that it broke the first time i carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal one of the little fingers that holds the ball in the socket on the back of the tuner broke off so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces this model works only by vibration unlike the red one so without the clip it is not very useful it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it but it isn t very convenient i would just super glue it together at a good angle but i have to put it in different positions on different instruments i ve seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem so i would call it a design weakness despite the negatives i would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case update added back a star i m still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer even with a slightly compromised mount it continues to provide excellent results i recently purchased a replacement the sn b but found it really disappointing so much so i may send it back i also tried a planet waves mini headstock tuner which no matter how much i try i simply cannot love so i just ordered another one of these despite the ball socket issue it is still one of the best tuners i ve ever used for the money i can afford to keep a couple on hand ok i like this one a lot it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime it is accurate easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing it sure beats the other units i have used where you clamp on some weird thing tune up and then stash back in your gig bag this one is bing on tune and back to playing it weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up
488	the strings sound great on my full size acoustic nice bright but warm tone full bodied sound but not so great on my size guitar this is an excellent product i ve used one of these before and don t remember it having lock washers this does when you tighten this down it actually stays tightened for you cannot go wrong with this bear in mind that it s for a standard hole diatonic harmonica not the hole chromatic style i got mine and i gave it a try here are the conclusions it looks really good sturdy and well made is super stable i tried it out with strats and a electro acoustic then removed one strat and placed another acoustic a string this time i pushed the stand and it holds as guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar bass or whatever you put in there falls down you can set the height always considering that your guitars don t reach the floor so totally recommended thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly maybe my hands are just sweaty
489	this is a fine cable at a decent price point nothing exceptional mind but it gets the job done well enough i put it on the boom of my mic stand tight on some not on others i need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place the tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when i ve been playing a lot the problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pull offs less fluid a few strokes of ghs makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience an alternative would be using vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard also i sometimes use an emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but i d rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong ghs allows me to minimize that got a cleaner polish wax type ointment for every part of your guitar comes with a small rag and fret polishing pad deal the fret pad is great and i didn t know about this type of thing till getting this kit also comes with a step by step stage by stage instruction pamphlet worth it to get this kit and replace add to it as needed all three of my kids have a guitar they were always losing their picks this pick holder is the neatest thing i have seen in a while all of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar i highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks i have used ernie ball strings on my les paul for quite a while slinkys mostly i recently bought a yamaha fg s and quickly found that the high e string had a very tinny tone i searched the net to see if this was comon with this model alas i found that it is so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night wow what a difference first the tone is much softer on the e string second the action feels much more comfortable on strings thru the strings that came on the guitar were yamaha light strings but they were very stiff especially the b string after a hour of playing with the earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable both tonally and physically not sure how they will last time will tell good strings i would recommend them works great i am a fan of joyo i own the vintage od the ultimate drive the sweet baby the us dream the crunchbox clone and this one this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal i m giving it stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap but the octive leaves much to be desired i have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue apparently one of the components is installed in a reversed positon which results in the lackluster octive i haven t taken mine apart for the fix but i read that it s just unsolder flip and resolder the same component you can google it for better instructions still this ain t bad for the pocket change they charge the reason i haven t fixed it yet is i have the feeling that once i mod it it will sound just like my dano french toast albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass i ve had a jam man for some time which as a tech person i ve found incredibly difficult to figure out perhaps i didn t take the time anyways this pedal on the other hand is a leap forward in the opposite direction i didn t need instructions just punched in layed down a riff and jammed for about hours straight i did this for two days in a row it s simple built well and and fun to use can t recommend it enough it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
490	this little guitar stand works very well i like it much better than the larger stands that support a guitar by the neck i play guitar and sing in relatively small places such as cafes i previously used a fender acoustasonic jr and i got tired of lugging it about lbs and all of my other gig equipment around with the cm i can get it lbs mic stands music stand mic and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip a big plus i like the sound quality i get my guitar is an acoustic alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a shure sm the roland doesn t have a huge amount of volume but if you re looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport set up and take down this is a good choice if i used it a with a passive guitar pick up i d want external preamp think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room i m also thinking i will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my acoustasonic jr it looks really rugged so i m looking forward to years of happy use this audio adapter works perfectly why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio i m able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers handy well made small easy to see great for guitar fiddle mandolin dobro and other instruments that it can clamp to
491	i like replacing pickguards truss rod covers knobs etc on my guitars this is a nice part looks awesome on my les paul traditional desert burst love the holder and the picks looke great and nice and i don t have to look around for my picks when i m ready to play my guitar simple and compact no clicking or buzzing perfect for old van halen solos like in you really got me plus you can get a swooshing bright sound you can t get with a flange and chorus when backing it down and playing clean play some old kiss or some rob zombie bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser isn t available in most amp emulators you know your man is working hard he s worth a deuce i have been disappointed with the last eq pedal i owned witch was a boss ge it was very honkey and colored my tone to much this pedal is much more musical the layout of the essential frequency s is great plus they are lighted and very ez to see and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank and will last for ever this is a great effect awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations you will not be dissappointed at all ships fast highly recommended the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain everything needed came with the combo making it ready to go right out of the box this is simply one of the best pedal boards out there it is very well made resistant tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape looks good too i would recommend to get a few roles of power grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcro included especially if you have a combination of both regular size mxr or boss and bigger pedals like a cry baby or a vox satchurator or time machine reverb if thinking of purchasing one of these you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized now if you are on the road for long i would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case for eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok this is a great effect i am very happy with it awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable this delay device is on my humble opinion probably the best delay out there it is very sensitive and delivers as it should with a delay rate from to miliseconds most units offer a max of around the mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards this pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver i am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended my les paul is heavy the strap would constantly fall off so i decided to get a set of strap locks these installed in minutes and really dont change the look of the guitar at all you will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap if you dont have locks on all your guitars you cant interchange your straps easily any more so i recommend getting them for all your guitars the other added benefit i found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back with these locks the strap sits away from the guitar so it fixes that problem as well when i buy a new guitar i get new locks are there better locks out there i m not sure but im committed now as i wanted the same locks on all my guitars has never failed me yet yeah i kind of bought it on a whim it s confusing as hell first of all i don t really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described this is just another cable out there there is nothing special in particular about it it does what it should cheers if you like thick heavy gauge picks but find they wear too fast for you this is the pick for you they have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff but also wear as in don t wear down like nothing else these were a very nice find wow does this stick or what i installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this power grip mounting tape on the top and bottom of the pedal hof reverb and one afternoon i stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn t budge had i known this before i would have installed all my pedals with this power grip wonder need sticking power this tape will definitely fill the requirement
492	i use this for my epiphone zakk wylde custom les paul it fits perfectly in the case one of the best cases i own and have seen the carpet is awesome also has a pocket in the middle what holds the neck up and can fit a strap and even a pedal very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive gibson case it s a cool pedal especially considering it s price but don t be fooled all this pedal does is perform volume swells any other sound you are able to create with this pedal you wouldn t just be using this pedal think of it as a supplumentary effect if you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal you need to use it in combination with other effects reverse delay wah distortion etc it s convenient too if you are playing and you want use volume swells but you also want to use other effects like wah whammy something else that requires the attention of your feet if you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells i would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it pure convenience it has it s quirks though if you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain to the point where its non existent but the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly if sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck the rest will just play as if the effect was off other than that its built well doesnt add any hiss no noticeable signal loss other than if the sensitivity is at min the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure power adapters are your friend it s cheap its convenient but i wouldn t recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry oh that reminds me the casing is plastic i bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer that solution was successful these speakers put out enough power that i can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp i have a watt amp that powers a celestion speaker these monitors have watts powering a woofer and a tweeter w w respectively slight drop in the power output but they are beefy enough that i don t really notice the isolation pads they come with are paper thin almost pointless if you really need some get some more substantial pads the back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours not really concerned about that but it s worth mentioning they have great sound excellent low end lots of clarity throughout they are pricey but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon i would really recommend not going to a retailer even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors
493	ok i am a pro musician rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road i was using an old ibenez chorus pedal one of the first to hit the market of which i did not use much basically due to it s used for certain songs i upgraded from using separate pedal boards to a single unit decided to buy the boss ch super chorus to add to the collection after my first gig i removed the ibenez chorus pedal because of the tonal superiority of the boss unit i am certain there are units that may boast of being better but i have found through my years of playing that more money is not always better great tones easy operation and it is the best bet for the money i like the product a lot for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect it is not so long as i thought i though it would be like the piano s sustainer but it s a good pedal effect my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect thank you good and transparent compressor with low noise operation very tough construction although not the best it sounds good to me it depends on the situation the sustain is good not expensive not cheap not exactly what i wanted like most all of the behringer items it has good points and duh points if you use it as an a b one input to outs then you can use the volume controls i did not need it for that if you use it as inputs and out you only control the sum out not the individual inputs thought you could which is why i bought it the page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can but you can not i almost sent them back i bought for a special set up needing to adjust the input levels that i was switching the led indicators when using it as a in out like guitars into one amp or in my case a mando and a midi guitar rig into a single line in are exactly backwards the one on the right red is actually the input on the left and the one on the left green is the input on the right which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant operation wise no hums no buzzes but no one left on bass when it is all said and done i am glad i kept them amazon rocks got them in days free shipping where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys who said santa was a scrouge i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket now i can use the clean channel on my amp with this pedal for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel for my other pedals and my electric guitar for musicians in a budget this is the deal it is not the best but it still does the job not very powerful to read the signal of strings in my acoustic guitar as it does the boss tuner but for electric or bass is fine very accurate too just gettit if u are in a budget
494	everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another i have a personal preference for the xlr ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside first to slide down the cable with a legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters unfortunately that design isn t used here but i chose to award the star rating for value because you get of good quality shielded cable with xlr ends m and f for well under ft as for pinout it s straightforward pin is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends while pins and are run isolated between both ends the end design chosen uses the single set screw connector the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart and the rubber bumper design on the back which i haven t had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer s kit because they will be used not if but when the need arises another favorite of mine is the pack of foot male to female cables which do use my favorite xlr ends mentioned above which amazon will rush you gls audio ft patch cable cords xlr male to xlr female black cables balanced snake cord pack these are very easy to open an end change phase lift ground or input someone s oddball source signal having on hand means you won t quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix back to pyle s product here i basically took away star for not using the easy to open and re wire xlrs but gave them a star for value in the product since it s feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot it s also great when someone yells it s too short i need a cable stretcher at the podium and quickly adds feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn t planned for or got moved quit working for the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing i finally equipped my cable kit with the usual xlr to rca trs hi z transformers and the above mentioned pack of foot cables to quickly gain access to the xlr terminals if need be plus of these foot cables mainly to solve distance problems and a roll of gaffer s tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards i used to have ea foot xlr cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now i have one left for my kit with all that i had to build an emergency xlr to mm ts all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin even though all this was under it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on so a bit of what if thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner s daugher s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made it will no doubt be needed again and since you made it you ll know why how and where it was used before thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem people think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position my only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn t serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted xlr pin stereo y splitter to dual trs female cable i made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry i chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when i setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that stereo channel in rehersal at the console this little guy has help me record with my apogee one voices and amps to prevent air flow shock on diaphragm wanna have excellent recordings get one i was looking for a sustainer pedal for my m audio keyboard to use with garageband and found this so i bought it and it works great does exactly what it says it does and actually looks cool it s an amazing tool for keyboard player highly recommended when you extend it out all the way it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom but other than that this stand is perfect purchased two of these one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other amps speakers works in both environments very well individual channel volume control is perfect no hum hiss from these units at all
495	i paid dollars for this it must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it s not cheap at all folds up for transport works great on hardwood floors padded where it needs to be and has a strap so it doesn t fall forward either angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet look for something where the legs enter the carpet more straight down the only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy also the holes are a little hard to hook in the beginning i bought these to fill the dunlop pick holder that i also purchasd nice selection and the price was right capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary this one has a very strong spring so i am hoping i lossens up with use
496	excellent simple product fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing easily holds picks at at time on each end has grooves on ends and one can slide it down so that at least strings fit into the grooves best string capo i have ever used and that s over decades works easily and flawlessly very well made five stars works perfect for guitar strings used it when i restrung my schecter hellraiser solo it has locking tuners so i was able to use this to cut the strings all the way down i have had them on my loar guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine we will see how long they last i have used elixir for electric and while they do last longer i wish it was a bit longer these strings sound great i love the sustained bright tone they work well with my cedar top guitar easy on the fingers too sweet little neck stand very light weight folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag padded to protect guitar neck blocks noise perfectly priced better than the local store fit very well my mic awesome great for an amateur just like me re strung my eko ranger with these d addario ej light strings and am again getting a nice ringing tone with good sustain no issues like breaking or dead strings that i had with elixir s just good sound this stand it just arrived in the mail will be durable in the years to come with my music i can tell awesome stand and i would recommend to anyone you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another however you cannot go wrong with those strings i highly recommend them i like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings i have tried my band had no pa or mics or anything while i admit these are not the quality a band will work up to they fill up the stands at an affordable price not much distance you have to eat the mics but the sound is great full range clear not muddy and no breaking up of sound this is a great place to begin i had the sn guitar tuner this one the sn is actually for all instruments if i m not mistaken and it works great never fails i love the red the swivel head the green red lights when tuning just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well
497	i bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well for only it is a steal the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy i have used it with multiple mics such as the audio technica with the samson sp shock mount a rode k a studio projects c and a neumann tlm i have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic i was not going to write a review for this product but i came across another review that stated i purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a at with a sp shockmount mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what i try this is absolutely false the samson sp shock mount works perfectly with this stand as any shock mount or mic would since the threading is a standard size i just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion also almost every shock mount has an adapter in the mount where the shock mount connects to the mic stand that is slightly smaller than most us mic stands but this comes out all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it from the shock mount after the adapter is out the samson sp will connect to this stand i highly recommend this product i bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but i have a completely different view the at is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser it is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts but there are a bunch of better mics near this price two that come to mind are the mxl v g and studio projects b stay away from the studio projects c both exceptional microphones for the price although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing the mxl a a lot of people have claimed the studio projects c sounds like the neumann u it doesn t the mxl a however sounds very similar and is easily the best ldc mic under with that being said the at is not a bad microphone but it is not great to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone although to be fair i have a lot of experience in pro audio and production so i maybe a bit overly critical one thing is for sure though there are definitely better mics in or near this price range i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone it matches the mic well color wise and fit the c fits the mount perfectly i recommend this mount highly http www amazon com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c i am completely blown away with these headphones the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
498	i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good i have world tour bags to keep my axes safe nice padding nice features i had a line pod that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that i considered a few different brands and even other line pod models i even ordered a pod xt only to cancel that order when i realized that you can download tones from the line website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval as many have said the batteries that come with it did not last long at all but that was kind of expected i have since been using energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs plus i have a volt ac adapter that works great especially when i am recording to use it for recording simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you ll be able to record with all the tones you could want i downloaded a joe satriani sound and am so happy with it that i have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great i am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough but i found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to grip better and stay put so that it doesn t slide right off i am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with i don t play live so i cannot say how well it would work for that i had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things needless to say the strings were at least years old and i was about to replace them with new ones but thought i would give this a try i am amazed at how good the strings feel now they really are like a new set of strings saved me bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves my only reason for knocking off star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be they could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done
499	great tool i used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys but this trims steel and nylon with ease the quick slack take up winder is nice also but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars very good string i ve been using elixir strings for about ten years now i ve been a full time musician for about years now and for what i do these sound the best and last for or more month s within these ten years i ve only had strings break on me and i sometimes work days a week for many for at a time these stay connected but aren t so wide that they change the style of picking i like them and so does my music teacher we try to stay stocked in these picks came on time works very good strong spring that good start if needed i would buy another for me and my son it works great i ve bought quite a few tuners over the years these are small responsive easy to read and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference these are great at first i was turned off by the toyish appearance but decided to try it after reading the reviews let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics and they perform way better than i expected love it fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate a must have for any musician
500	i don t believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo but this one is quite good for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use it does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built it is as with all capos important to take it off when not in use so the rubber does not get grooved this is just good common sense if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another we geetarists are a funny bunch we ll change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long and spend a fortune doing it but sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks case in point pure nickel strings time was when that was all there was and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled coincidence nope these things just sound better if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds if you re used to wrapped strings and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general especially if you use tubes tubes and pure nickel are like gilmour and strats or angus and sgs they just fit i m not nuts about fender acoustic strings but i like their normal electric strings fine though ernie ball slinkies have been my go tos for many years but these fender pure nickels are very very nice and at they re a real deal most pure nickels run nearer to ten and these sound pretty much the same and i don t seem to break many of em neither if you re used to mixed alloy pure nickels might seem a little dull but wait a bit and you ll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips try a set and see what i mean it s subtle but it s beautiful but the main reason i love these is for playing at volume i turned my modded hot rod deluxe up to call the cops levels the neighbors are getting used to it by now louder than the drummer by a good chunk and i got less squealing warmer tone by far and full chords triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string i ve ever used i think there s an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime check out bb s tone on the legendary live at the regal to hear what i mean that s the stuff so if you haven t tried pure nickels spend a buck or two more or maybe less than you normally do and give these bargain priced nickels a try you might find that you re a convert within seconds i know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up those zep and jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel and digging into some otis rush or billy gibbons licks is like night and day the bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels hell of a bargain at less than five bucks as musicians sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level for me it happened when i found just the right sound feel from my taylor acoustic guitar the right vocal mics the right mixer my bose l model ii etc today i had one of those finds after years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo i ve encountered i discovered the perfect capo for me the g th performance capo i m not kidding it was one of those finds as an acoustic guitar player vocalist obviously i have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance this means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape structure unfortunately some of my songs had weak spots sending them to my b list courtesy of the combination of a weaker chord for me due to physical limitations the reduced sustain tonal quality resulting from using a capo this dissatisfaction has had me on a capo quest which ended today when i found the g th performance capo the first thing i noticed when i used the g th was the improved sustain over every other capo i ve used all of those weak spots in my songs totally disappeared i quickly dusted off several songs that were on my b list found the improved sustain tonal quality allowed me to move them to my a list i have no problem with the weight of this capo others have pointed out that it is heavier i can t detect any change in balance when handling my guitar i play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance i love the self ratcheting feature of the g th i thought from some reviews videos i watched that i d have to pinch down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold this was not the case i think the g th has just the right width density of foam under the top bar a providing more friction to hold this capo in place b playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings c possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow harder foam or rubber top bar thus having less impact on tuning i did find one slight negative about this capo which i was able to quickly overcome the end of the top metal bar on the open end of capo is slightly more squared off than the end of the bottom piece which in contrast is rounded off it may be just the way i play some chords but my hand was contacting that squared off end of the top bar was getting irritated so i simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me versus facing the floor the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother thus zero irritation this was nothing new to me i have had to do this with other capos others have commented on the cost of this capo for me the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars i ve spent finding just the right guitars pa s mics other equipment accessories i almost can t believe it only cost me to make such a difference in my sound the g th performance capo is priceless overall i highly recommend this capo if you re like me this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level i m a strong believer in having back ups for critical components so i will immediately purchase another g th as a back up maybe i ll order the black or gold use my silver one as the back up plain leather looks good and has the fender logo prominent no padding which may be a bit of a problem if you are playing long hours i use it on a black and white stratocaster and am happy with it very good for a quick tune up might be a little to tight for checking intonation very fast readout and fast on off
501	looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks the pick pocket is cool though i won t be using it very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well exactly as described in the ad not a whole lot to say about it quality materials works well love to keep my taylor on it but had to re case the guitar during our low humidity days very nice guitar picks for the very fair price i like them very much of course i am just a beginner although i didn t purchase my snark sn on amazon i wanted to share my excellent customer service experience about a company that clearly cares about its customers i had a problem with my snark and the company displayed first class customer service exceeding my expectations the sn is a must have as far as i m concerned i had been using my iphone until a friend recommended the snark tuner so much easier to use and i like the logical incremental led display that shows if you re flat or sharp on my iphone the app i ve been using doesn t always display the frequency when i m really out of tune so i have no visual indicator of where the tuning is at if i had a better ear no problem but such is not the case snark not only shows you with the bar display but also displays the notes your string is playing much easier you don t need to select your tuning or anything first it picks up your frequency on whatever string you re on and you simply dial it in great sturdy clip with a well thought out foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric i usually just leave the snark on my music stand where i can use the visual metronome you can also just clip it to a nearby desk buy this with confidence you ll love it edit although i still love this little tuner my model has suffered a few issues which i will address here i m not certain if it s a design flaw or not but the little plastic pieces that serve as the socket joint on both ends of the adjustable ball arm have a tendency to snap off i think the manufacturer should look into this and perhaps design a single ring of plastic which may have more integrity also the rubber feet fell off long ago with very moderate use at my home the electronics themselves have held up admirably
502	every guitar player should own this tool instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool simple no frills stand only problem i ve had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off a lil glue will fix it just haven t had time i ve played guitar for some years and have found d addario strings to be of consistently good quality they are one of maybe three companies i trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel their strings produce excellent sound and are durable like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing but i ve never played a set of this brand that i didn t like they always provide vibrant tonal quality and no i don t work for d addario just a long time fan does what a strap should holds guitar fine and is built well for five bucks i like the unique pattern on this thing too came in a timely manner what else is there to say made in canada one day i was getting ready to play a show and stuck my hand in my pocket my pick was gone i checked in my case no picks so minutes before i start i m scrambling all over trying to find a pick luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these as soon as i touched it i though this feel weird i went and played my set using one of these and i absolutely loved it the pick feels great in my hand and plays really well and this was the first time i ve played with a pick that i knew wasn t going to come flying out of my fingers after i got home from the show i jumped on amazon and ordered a pack for myself like i said i love these things this is a very nice cable i like this one better than all the other ones that i own its thick and the sound is great then one day an amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off that stunk
503	this is a proven classic using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet sounds fantastic and is solidly built ok i understand it now i use abelton live and thought this would be and easy read cheap interface to record some instruments with wrong i am returning it it does not work has no drivers and is not detected on my mac my mac finds everything bought the focusrite unit instead got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings save your money and time buy the focusrite interface or one of the others yes over but you either want feedback hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance it also lacks plug one rca input you need an addapter not what i thought i was getting dumb me should have paid the extra and bought the mustang oh well the amp has light sound and not much control good for my small space though i d give this baby six stars if i could my prior practice amp a vox was very nice but finally went south and required replacement i was looking for something with a great tube sound as most of the solid state amps that i ve used mainly fenders and line stuff just don t get there i was actually looking at the fender blues junior and headed to my local gc to check em out and listen side by side the first time i plugged a strat into this guy in the store i was blown away and that was with all of the jimmy page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store i ve gotta say part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a blues junior but the bugera actually sounded better the only one left in the store was the floor model so i grabbed it got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations it s solid and heavy it s still a small fry slightly bigger than most w amps out there but much heavier the construction is great i think i read some reviews that knocked the construction but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it s built to last the sound is even better at home without the gc cacophony adjustments are minimal but enough the tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp i ve run my strat tele and taylor t through this i think the hard bodies get the best blues tone but i can get a really nice clean tone from my t the headphones sound great i was really surprised by this i would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones the price is self explanatory but that s really the part that blew me away this amp would sell for double the price tag works out great for my two ukus hung it on the wall looks good and is easy to adjust etc i m using this unit to set up a linux digital audio workstation it works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer you will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records khz but skips when duplexed i mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabled the following settings are the best i ve been able to manage in jackd without and xruns on a realtime kernel using qjackctl i m also no expert frames period sample rate periods buffer which gives a predicted latency of mswith a ft inch patch cord to run jack iodelay i got a consistent ms overall latency not bad imho without the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings my computer is a sandy bridge pentium ghz with gb ram and a ssd we have used this with an at at sm microphones and the sound quality is quite high the preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding i ve also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds rain crickets and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the house update i ve found the above setting in jack don t work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack here are the best setting i could come up withframes period sample rate peiods buffer realtimesoft modeqjackctl lists the latency of ms but i have not tried measuring i with jack iodelay all the included effects of rakarrack work on my computer for these while booted in the hard realtime kernel
504	these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time great capo i ve tried a lot of other capos including some pretty expensive brand name capos and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings these and the extra lights are great strings they felt so good on the guitar after the old set that i had now i m stuck replacing them often because i love the feeling of new strings they play great have nice action and tone i use them on a yamaha acoustic and the two together sound great good quality strong and excellent finish nicely priced a foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing a must for classical players i bought one of these at a music store like years ago for bucks i was impressed and used i to tune my guitar bass and mandolin later i saw them for here on amazon and i bought for myself for a sister and another for my brother in law these are a great deal i can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud it just uses vibration of the instrument
505	this music stand is og great quality and of a great price i have been very pleased with it i have bought on stage stands in the past before so i was sure that i wouldn t be disaapointed and i was right very sturdy well built good price i had purchased a different strap for my f style mandolin and it was adequate but when i learned of this neotech strap and how adjustable it was i ordered it and tossed my earlier strap this should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well my only complaint is that the button hole doesn t stay on the end pin of my epiphone mandolin i solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick i wasn t happy with drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn t fallen off since over months of daily playing i bought this used off a friend when i got my first electric it s a great little practice amp that is plenty loud enough for a small room the destortion works well enough bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine input jack has held up real well so far amp is about years old now and the speaker is pretty clean my only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough i can t practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv i suppose a set of headphones would solve this problem but then its something else i gotta plug in and worry about i find that i like the sound of the overdrive better especially thru my epi lp but just can t play it low enough i end up having to turn the overdrive off and then turning the amp up loud and turning the guitar down real low if you have issues with volume control in your house then make sure to get a set of headphones or else you could suffer the dirty looks and the banishment i have suffered all in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode the screen could be a little brighter otherwise no complaints i was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my fender beginner s mandolin set worried i d permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them having a dozen similar a few for me and a few to share meets the need he heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks i purchased two fender instruments a mandolin and an acoustic guitar each of which came with a fender clamp on tuner with similar functionality but i thought to give the snark a try i haven t used the sound versus vibration mode much nor have i done much with the metronome function much i can t speak to them however i am very pleased with the vibration tuning compared to the fender both will get your strings tuned well what i like better about the snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers with the fender i feel i have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again and that adds up when moving from string to string the snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag the trade off is any easy to read display lately it s become my go to tuner
506	lets be honest it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth it either cleans or it doesn t this cleans polishes all of my guitars great just make sure the strings are off so that this doesn t get caught on them this is a brand i ve come to trust lifesaver i bought this and a planet wave s o port which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well i use this at every show where i have to plug in this is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn t want to worry about feedback those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars
507	what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal right at the upper lip works well for me the bass cut and presence boost are convenient use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids flat s where it s at flat sounds most natural being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might though it takes eq well and you can eq that in if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix so what does it sound like the sound is very natural and true to my voice it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic this thing is heavy and rugged the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one but since my room isn t perfect this will do the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser it really does of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well seriously a db shelf in the highs another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest it s a very solidly made stand simple to assemble perfect for my home studio holding my key midi controller keyboard i m very happy with the purchase and the price was right these speakers worked great for months last week one of them wouldn t power up all the way the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them and it s just a matter of time before it stops working it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake i only use them between and hours per week i contacted m audio s online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops one on the east coast and one on be west coast i ve since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m audio support site m audio doesn t stand behind their products and i ll never purchase anything from them again i ve tried so many other strings over the years just to see if i was missing something i wasn t there s something about the feel and tone of ernie ball regular slinkys that i absolutely love my local music store has for the price of deal on strings which is a nice deal however this deal is a little sweeter if you can wait for the delivery it s a no brainer
508	good quality and doesn t cost very much the price is great too glad i bought it folds up well has a black finish on it i only have a low cost mahala ukulele so i wasn t expecting much of an improvement when i replaced the stock nylon strings after watching several youtube videos showing me how to do it i was wrong these strings sound much better the sound is much brighter and cleaner than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new the aquila strings took about minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods my ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers i would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn and by that i mean the design flaws you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading and they eat batteries like crazy the snark sn is far superior i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon this thing is awesome it s so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it oh and it turns itself off after seconds of no sound it does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark but the more i use it the better feel i get for it if you don t have one get one this is so darn cool it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune and it works on so many instruments
509	i had bought one a few years ago when i was a little short on cash i was very skeptical that this would work for me after my guy set it up it played flawlessly to say the least once i got my tele back and my acoustic gibson back the life of a out of work guitar player always the pawn shops best customer but i was able to incorporate the dean in with both of them and it gave me another electric to play this cheap little dean guitar has turned into a favorite for me plug it in and sit back and enjoy what comes out of it very crisp with no noise so if your looking for a good cheap guitar to either learn on or just something that you can pick up and play and i have never had anyone tell me that it sounded horrible and it got me through some tough times that is why i just bought another one for practice i hope that you will be able to use this review for your decision bottom line you can t go wrong with this guitar peace i wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands there is of course very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny but hey it s just a volt battery i just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device they put a lot of thought into this amp and it is outstanding for the budget price keep in mind you can patch another volt powered device through this one to enhance it i will at some point run my boss digital delay box through it to check that out the belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice and i got it in red as a change of pace because i always get black with my equipment it looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character nice product danelectro i d say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection i don t use them all too often because they re a bit too stiff though what s not to like beatles picks a super cool little tin rocks my world and back to the garden when this arrived i didn t realize it was that small thought it has to be so its out of the way then i thought this thing can t work very well but it does perfectly the first few times a used it i wasn t expecting muchhowever i couldn t more wrong it really works well and i would recommend this to family or friends
510	good overall but pick ups are terrible might be better replacing the pickups but i wasn t willing to spend the extra money arrived on time and as described the strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come it is basic and not fancy it does the job is comfortable and the price is right i have four of these pro tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years this one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea so far forget to use it but that will come star for plastic otherwise excellent youtube has many reviews on these the fab pedals are great values for what a flanger is for me this is perfect great sounds great price i mean you paid for a pedal that if you want to buy from the boss it s about times this price and if you want it behringer it s about twice this price it does what is supposed to and it doesn t have a cheap look for home and garage entertainment is good enough i was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand but now that i know that i like it i m going to buy the distortion red one i m only sad they don t make a noise gate or something similar that would be the top of the deal this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home it s a great little unit the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones i read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than i do and since most people seemed to like it i figured i d give it a try i was not disappointed at all it gives you great sound for solos i ve tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that it s quite versatile i still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound i want but i think that s just learning about the effects this box provides behringer us ultra harmonist shifter pedal is pretty good you need a little time to learn then it will rock you just try it i used to use the tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these i ended up using that pick for something like years playing times wk once i started playing hrs wk at my church i decided that this pick had proven its self so i order a small box i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one fyi i generally don t play hard and i always play acoustic nanoweb custom lights i like these nice tortoise look with planet wave logo is nice they have more flex than most which i also find suits me they ride a little higher for me which i also like but if you like low let s say midway across cuticle may find a bit pinchy but i find the gauge suits me great and overall comfort is good for my average thumb size behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer it is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting i ve had more expensive pedals over the last years of playing but it s hard to beat the price features and quality of the behringer pedals i acquired this recently i did not need another strat style or copy of but it s white just gotta love that vibe anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good here s a few add ons in case it s routed hsh under the hood but looks tight think it s bucker size upgradable top and bottom didn t measure i like single coils the white is a poly finish love poly durable and crack fade resist and exquisite nicely done alder body but it s hefty alder like lb or so not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice too nice to change like i was thinking till i got it nice quality control on these really smooth rosewood board with med jumbo that s what i call anyway frets good fretting standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed no missed screw holes etc was set up with standard action etc out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc great fit and finish best i can tell its a standard f type plate if interested looks to be easy changer overall it s a solid piece assembled well for me the body and neck is what seals the deal better then most out there this range it is alder and hefty but durable i look to change most hardware in time so won t comment on that what s there is installed well things i forgot tuners wanna say mm standard import style seem good not legendary and tremelo whammy standard zinc block there s the must upgrade part it s standard string space import i got one pet peave it s steel or brass blocks a shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe best money ever spent i can t afford the gotoh or callahan stuff on this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you ll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better also the neck i say nice but i mean it s nicer than most in the shape it s slightly chunky c shape not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets it s beefier i have avg size hands i find it s a good fit in all if your looking in this price range it s nice and upgradable as you can or learn more honest for cost it s star but i got and handle was slightly mismolded rubber groove is a little off but in no way matters just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel this is a nice heavy cordura like military spec heavy with self repairing zippers standard kind and totally adequate pad soft nylon lined and bonus pockets nice build pvc piping on pocket edges adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight heavy rubber feet for standing it up give a of wet ground protection if needed for the price of many other brands i got and for what most folks expect they are great
511	i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar i did see this device on amazon com and i decide to buy and try one i was pleasantly surprised with this guitar quick release system is working good with my acoustic guitar and because of that i did purchase more for my other guitar and for my friend one this new type and design of capos manufactued in england and warranteed for life is truly wonderful available in six and twelve string steel string as well as a new classical version they are all easy to use solidly built and perhaps most importantly easy to put on and take off with one hand without having to retune for a musician this is the most cricial element that and that it is kind to the materials used in the manufacture of a good guitar i use mine on a martin hd and have had no problems whatsoever a great move toward a new generation of capos not cheap but worth every cent used these for years on son s electric guitars no fuss mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall no neck damage to axes mounts well but try to find a stud certainly keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall no complaints if you re going to drill your wall is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers all star reviews on this baby and i agree and i add to that total stars i never use slide to play my guitar this is the first i ever have look like good quality i just have to learn how to play for what it s supposed to do it works very well i also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better i think this is still usable but it is for very big fingers i think i have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there but this still leaves some extra room either way it works well it feels very sturdy and i m not worried about it cracking anytime soon for the price it s a must have these strings aren t anything fancy but they sound great a good old standard that i ve used since i was a kid and this is the best price i ve found let me start of by saying this tuner is great my previous tuner was a korg ca and frankly that tuner is terrible the main differences between sat and the ca sat has a build in light ca does not ca has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a deg angle sat does not sat has a auto and manual mode ca has auto sat displays the octave of the note e g e e etc ca displays only displays the alphabet e for all oactaves sat has a numerical display for the cents off ca does not what made me get a new tuner is how finicky the ca when using the build in mic the needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner yes it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability another issue with the ca is the poor screen the screen is so dark and only viewable head on the ca does not have any of the flaws of the ca and is even more accurate what this tuner has accuracy usability durability versatility what more can you ask from a tuner of this price
512	this is the best invention since the wheel as far as i m concerned it s easy to clamp onto my guitar head and the frequency not readings are quite accurate it s incredibly easy to use and very handy when re stringing a guitar i bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo it works good on all of them and is very accurate i also used it to tune my uncle s mandolin for him because he couldn t find his tuner other than that theres not much else to say p i haven t used the metronome so i can t comment on that
513	i only do test recording with this digitally to get a better idea of my learning process from the other side it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have i bought a string one in blk love it for simplicity and needed it so i didn t have to keep searching for the other got gold to remind me it is for six strings this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand it is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing only thing make sure you read the description well it is a euro stand so it has threads it does not come with a mic clip when i ordered my mic from behringer their clip had standard threads which obviously would not attach i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going overall i would buy again i needed a volt adapter to use with an danelectro n b honey tone mini amp this was recommended and i am happy with the product
514	i ve been using these cables for more than months and they are holding up pretty well for years i used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend when they finally gave out i got in the habit of using the no name cables that are always on display near the register at guitar center really more of an impulse buy than something i put any thought into after the third or fourth guitar center cable failed from light use i decided to try these cables not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better i am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as i move around and the cheaper ones eventually fail mid cable i don t mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable this cable is actually cheaper or so shipped and it s holding up pretty well these are actually very reasonably priced for cables there is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but i haven t needed it five stars for a nicely made foot guitar cable that costs shipped incidentally these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp s input do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose edit more than months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues the price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended there are probably better values from hosa monster or planet waves use this alot on all kinds of electronics it gets crackling knobs going again i ve use it for years recommend let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of dano stomp boxes i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make this pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs but imho the tremolo from dano s cool cat line is a much more durable pedal for only more at the time of this review the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link i don t think it s true bypass either the cool cat has a metal enclosure true bypass sturdier inputs and knobs and a much better on off switch the features and sound are the same spend the extra and you will have a much more bullet proof pedal with the cool cat trem for the money i have no complaints the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are it doesn t suck tone this pedal isn t the end all be all overdrive but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don t you lose a little low end when it is engaged but that actually works pretty well for leads especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of classic distortion encountered with el s as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right like any overdrive you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations lately i am running this into either the v cool cat transparent overdrive timmy clone very very nice or the behringer bo which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch jet city combo or palomino combo as with any overdrive this thing will not sound very good imho running into a solid state amp that s just not what it was intended to do it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv because i m a cheapskate and because these things are durable like bricks i bought it used for but it is well worth the new asking price well just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours i still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it s on it s great i ve been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can t seem to turn it off it s light small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for bucks it s a great deal this is a good eq for an excelent price not an excelent eq so i give it a out of and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my son s acoustic guitar he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings he says they last a lot longer and sound better too this is a very good ts type pedal at a great price the ability to adjust treb and bass is nice the enclosure is metal the knobs feel sturdy and the switch has a durable feel this is an analog pedal an the only digitech pedal i ve ever contemplated keeping i ordered this pedal through amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal if you don t have a ts type pedal this is a good cheap choice personally i didn t think it sounded any better or worse than my other ts type pedals behringer to joyo vintage overdrive deltalab to ts and ts as i indicated i have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol i opted instead for the dano cool cat transparent overdrive and i am very happy if you don t have a ts type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a ts you may want to check this out first what more can you ask for in a pedal that runs you twelve clams and ships for free this is not the highest quality pedal in terms of construction or tones but it gets the job done nicely for cheap if you are just starting to experement with stomp boxes or you are addicted to collecting stompboxes like yours truely you can t go wrong with the fab line i find the placement of the knobs just slightly annoying but it s a nitpick at this price point if you are looking for something like the boss ds this will pretty much cover the bases at less than a quarter of the price of the boss pedal if you are looking for more of a light breakup kind of box on the cheap get the dano overdrive instead the silver one i also find that for about ten bucks more behringer makes some great clone pedals i m not going to do any explaining about the science behind how this pedal works i m just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone this definitely isn t a boost and it s also not an eq the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal to the ear it serves to add clarity depth and body to your tone essentially this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing the lo contour knob doesn t increase the amount of bass produced by the amp rather it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass and low mid tone to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased but it hasn t you re just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh that s not to say that you can t dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something indeed it ll make those searing lead tones even better now i gave this product stars not because i ve had any issues with it or haven t been in any way unsatisfied with it but rather because it s really a fairly subtle effect at first i almost couldn t tell a difference between having it on and off with time i ve been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone but it doesn t make a night and day difference i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you re happy with and just want to make it even better this pedal won t make a cheap watt solid state combo sound like a tube half stack it won t make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before in conclusion though i definitely wouldn t put this pedal into the must have category it definitely improves the quality of my tone this is a pedal that i leave on all the time as it improves both clean and distorted tones these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well as other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it s not abused i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects i have found that the delay works well around percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay i don t know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves it s purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some eq tinkering i found a good mix of echo i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d and thought it would be a good idea again danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues the only reason i didn t give it stars is it tends to be a little noisey if you turn the gain up too much you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great great pedal very lush and usable tones think lightning crashes by the band live ok i was going to initially give it stars because of the following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does not click very miniscule volume drop with engagement actually i moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and i think that resolved the volume issue but i can t tell i guess if it is too close to tell then it s a non issue then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again metal enclosure works like a charm twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping it gets stars because there is nothing even close at this price the knobs are a little sketchy they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong but the sound is just great this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail i may buy a second one as a backup behringer hit a home run with this one not just a great sounding pedal for the price but an honest to goodness great sounding od pedal no true bypass but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you won t detect any tone suck it sounds good enough that i don t mind the lack of true bypass i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store who doesn t need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesn t work very well the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate it gets you in the ballpark but just barely strike a note once and it s sharp play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better i scored a virtually unused pre owned unit for it is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features but simple plug and play operation is possible my original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my pc my only gripe and it is considerable is that the unit sounds too digital to me particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade i probably would have loved this thing when i started playing more years ago than i care to admit i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals does that make me a gear snob not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days i ve also owned a tech trademark analog modeling amp not bad but traded and still have a tech tri ac analog preamp great pedal and a keeper both are modelers and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers i just prefer analog all the way around i eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar he likes it fine i gave stars because it s a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors i ve owned a ts since i purchased it used in the s for around yes this is a great overdrive this pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup now you re in tone heaven but the plain truth is this there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the reissue this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives i own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it s not the most transparent or versatile there is a mid hump in the eq of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn t i m glad i own mine but i don t think i d shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue if i am not mistaken both the ts and the ts can be modded to this circuit with less than cents in parts and about minutes of your time if this pedal came in under the mark it would be more deserving of five stars i really hate to burst anyone s bubble but srv s tone was really in his fingers and so is yours nice features on a pedal this cheap i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal not the bulletproof construction of a boss pedal but i have quite a few behringer pedals and i ve yet to have a malfunction in more than a year i have an eh big muff and this pedal is closer to that than to a dunlop fuzz face for this price it s another great tool for your arsenal one thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass if you string a bunch of them together you are going to experience the dreaded tone suck if most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass you will be fine folks that like the original ibanez tube king will love this pedal sturdier construction than most of behrenger s other pedals the housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid folks talk about how bad the stock tube is but that has not been my experience i may experement with a low gain jj in the future but the stock tube is staying put for now maybe i got lucky and they hand selected the right one this unit sounds really incredible when it s running into the front end of my el powered tube amp the sound is really organic and gritty with great harmonics and smooth sustain sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp no suprise there still an improvement from the sterile solid state tone be forewarned this pedal is gigantic in dimension who cares so long as it sounds this good i d wanted a vintage chandler butler tube driver forever but now i honestly don t need one this pedal gets me there on the cheap it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later i was using a nylon strap before i got this one i love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap the leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and i don t have that worry of it coming loose i agree with the others here this joyo is just a plain and simple od just like so many others but at a fraction of the price i put my pedals through three tests playing alone playing at rehearsal and gigs this thing stands up nicely on all three using it with am sp tele hiway strat squier epi lp spec w p and fender bj peavey classic sounds amazing in any combo giggin musician for over years for what its worth i ve reviewed several joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them not just because of the price to but also because of their apparent durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price but ultimately i decided that this is somewhere between a and review and i just can t give it the review i ve given the other joyo products i ve tried out thus far extremely high output and high sustain when i first plugged this thing in i had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal i would try out with my les paul and vox combo amp with the dials all at o clock big mistake this pedal has an extremely high output depending on the gain setting i was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the volume set at around this isn t necessarily a bad thing and it s certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder a frequent criticism of the boss ds but it s something to be aware of also i read several comments here that this isn t a high gain distortion i couldn t disagree more this thing has tons of gain i think people are thrown off by two things the name which pays tribute to the mi audio crunchbox it clones and the clarity transparency of the tone particularly the higher end range that shines through at all gain levels crunch in my mind refers to a punchy cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character the crunch distortion has a tone that doesn t really breakup or get fizzy as you turn up the gain but that s not what gain really is the gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note s but i think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesn t crack up hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up this actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work also which is one of the jf s strengths the setup is weird but workable because of everything i described above you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want my level is usually around to and is still very loud the crunchy classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist but only at around to of the gain setting and i had the tone knob generally working from o clock to o clock as it got a little too bright to go any higher again this is with les paul humbuckers ultimately what i decided was that this pedal has enough bass not too much in the midrange and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly if you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments i d imagine this pedal would do the trick it s costs less than half of many of it s true competitors while the affordability aspect is distinct from quality it cannot be ignored part of my initial disappointment was based on a side by side comparison with my mxr custom badass distortion the latter did have a fuller sound to it and was arguably better for rhythm work but that s an custom shop pedal from mxr try comparing this pedal to a boss ds or mxr distortion and it blows them out of the water in my opinion i m not sure want to roll with the crunch distortion being the only dirt box on my board but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind like a lead gain boost you could afford this and joyo s excellent ultimate drive overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even boss distortion pedals go for update about a week into owning this pedal i did revise this score from a to a rating if you graded the pedal in a vacuum i could absolutely see a rating for the price tag but ultimately there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that i haven t had with other joyo products so the score should reflect that please note also which i didn t realize before that the internal trim pot for presence is not easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it a distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment and i have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything i can t compare it as others have done with the ocd but it simply gives me an overdrive that i love i have several other od pedals tube screamer lovepedal kalamazoo and even a cheap danelectro ds the jf is truly my favorite right now i ve been using it with a strat and a les paul clone into either a fender vibro or a small bugera v it serves up great tones into either one these are great cables for connecting effects pedals and i love that they have a little color both for fun better organization to top it all off the price is right cheers i am a confessed and unrepentant hoarder of dirtboxes and i like this pedal a lot this is my th joyo pedal i already own the ultimate drive vintage overdrive crunch distortion and octive fuzz pedals i consider joyo and the dano cool cat line to be some of the best values in stomp boxes these days you ve already heard the particulars about this pedal so i won t go into the features the build quality does appear to be a hair shoddier than all my other joyo pedals which are earlier versions the switch seems a little less heavy duty and the case seems to be thinner metal that said the case is still metal and isn t going to fail in any way the switch well we will have to wait and see for or so i m not going to complain soundwise this product offers excellent gain for this price level it s not particularly suited for pantera but you can do modern mid gain up to metallica without any problems this is not an overdrive so it doesn t do the just on the verge of breakup thing like a tubescreamer does that s not what it was designed to do i run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good i ve also boosted it with the following with a good result sd pickup booster cool cat transparent overdrive tubescreamer ts joyo vintage od behringer to tech comptortion if you play rock hard rock through a single channel amp like a blues jr valve jr or pro jr and you want to make it a two channel amp this will get you there most people compare this pedal to the suhr riot i do not own that pedal so i can not fairly make a comparison i have seen several videos comparing the two and as far as that is concerned i hear enough similarity that i am not compelled to shell out for the riot another comparison that gets made is that the us dream is close to a proco rat i own an original s rat and i don t think they are all that similar the us dream has a tighter low end and more treble not better or worse just different enough that they don t completely cover the same sonic territory admitedly i don t own a newer rat maybe that one is closer to the us dream for what they are charging this is another home run for joyo this is my favorite pedal and i have a ton lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal great bluesy tones sweet and warm when the drive is down mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up like a cranked tube amp if you play the blues this is your pedal i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals this device sounds okay its usable but you should plan ahead if you re in the usa and want one it ships from mainland china it takes a while to get to the states this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs you can jam for hours with this thing it s awesome
515	i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably in fact they were so good that i purchased ten more when i went back to the same music store my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs the round side of the xh dunlop gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone i would recommend these to anyone like the title says ive been using these for years used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with i either use the s or the s and detune them dang that s metal were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line with a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome the only issue was with some manufacturing detail the input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time the buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time i used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is be sides that its metal nothing more nothing less razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal
516	my bass had original equipment dunlops on it but they were silver tone whereas all my other hardware is gold and after years they looked kind of dirty and tarnished so i knew it was time for a new gold set and i couldn t be happier with their look and quality i have used that other s brand on other instruments and really prefer the dunlops finally decided in getting the mm picks because i don t like them too thin or too thick this was the perfect gauge i was looking and hoping for the logo will wear out in a few uses but i don t much about that been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it s not wearing out too fast recommended great strap durable and good lookin it works great for me i like this type of strap s simple durable try one i love the design and the strap holds up very well i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol i ve almost exclusively used earnie balls and d addarios since i was a kid and have always been satisfied i ve taken advantage of amazon deals on both strings lately the d addarios are excellent strings and this price on the pack was unbeaten anywhere these strings from d addario are a personal favorite of mine i love the ej light gauge for their size and ease of use i think the light gauge is a nice size that won t hurt your fingers or put undue stress on your guitar not only that but they sound great not too big or not too small i have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass i love how they color code their strings on the ball ends to me this makes it much easier when changing strings you don t have to worry about mixing up your strings i ve also had no problem with the fit unlike some brands give these a try i think you ll be satisfied this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended cfh the snark sn is small accurate and easy to use i have a more sophisticated tuner and the snark works faster and is much easier to use
517	if you need some cables to connect your pedals look no farther these cables are perfect they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap what more could you ask for with a nice clean crisp sound inexpensive price and durable history i ve made these strings apart of my acoustic set i ve got at least spares at home right now xd i figured at this price i wouldn t be able to use this strap to secure my dean from hell guitar but figured if it wasn t up to being a reliable strap for my expensive pretty heavy ax that i could always use it for my rock band guitar and i m rather certain that this strap will outlast the rock band guitar so very pleased with this strap would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar that s likely plastic and very lightweight there are something special about these strings they ring so bright and beautiful i absolutely love them for my fenders i honestly don t use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele they re gorgeous sounding especially when new i m not a metal player in any means but sometimes i do get the urge if your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just so i got these and they are awesome they are not too big or too small very happy with these strings if you want great strings get fender strings they are the best out there but for metal big strings i stick with ernie ball this was perfect i am very happy with the hosa cfs inch right angle fx pedal cable pack jim dunlop has produced these for more years than i d like to admit to personal knowledge as long as i can remember i ve had one in my case and one on the workbench there are dozens of wannabe models but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol jim dunlop s i gotta remember not to get the black ones though i seem to lose them to easily or maybe they are really that good and they just get borrowed great pedal very lush and usable tones think lightning crashes by the band live ok i was going to initially give it stars because of the following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does not click very miniscule volume drop with engagement actually i moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and i think that resolved the volume issue but i can t tell i guess if it is too close to tell then it s a non issue then i performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again metal enclosure works like a charm twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping it gets stars because there is nothing even close at this price i own all versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them this one is my favorite turn on and go i think it s better than the sovereign first saw on youtube video how genius a pick that stays in hand makes me wonder how ever played without them small price for big help great pedall for the money it makes ur pedalls real quaiet it does what its soupose to german mind great electronics well made but plastic i really like the soft flexible cable these have they were perfect for my pedal board highly recommended you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased who doesn t love these tuners easy to use easy to read and has options that i don t even use highly recommend this genius idea that i wish i thought of first i actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place i would definitely recommend great overdrive distortion for classic rock music good volume roll off tones at full bore it sounds like vh and some other s rock dudes it s quiet and has a very active tone control the crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic not too much but just enough mxr has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do i now own a script phase and a micro chorus as well and plan on getting others i m a classic rock player these pedals have a classic s vibe this one sounds a bit nasal and thin on guitar i tried it on bass and it gives you that big raw ad thick stoner metal bass sound i like it
518	awesome quality strings love em just re strung my string it was a hassle but i got it done nicely i can t find a single complain about this amp the amp modelling is fantastic plug in for a mic cd m player quality driver i m not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website i used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds but you can t ask for much more for the price of you won t be disappointed with this amp pretty cool gadget a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles cans or sprays and does on a set of old strings i put these on my dlx players strat but it wasn t a piece of cake first problem no instructions came with the package found a method done by another searching online served as a guide second after removing the old fender tuners i noticed the new tuners didn t fit into the slots this meant drilling out the holes by another of an inch blue tape both sides as to prevent marring third the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock there are also with two dimples i used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement then carefully drilled two holes per tuner take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock these rest was simple install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze if you are not mechanically inclined then i strongly suggest you go to a luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions i bought this to use with a spider iv amp so far it works perfect provides effect control loop control tuner control also has volume wah pedal that works great you can plug it into the pc and customize everything recommended
519	i like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum a work of caution though like all snare resonant heads these are very thin they must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required but you must be careful i tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge not remo s fault but it is something to pay attention to i was very skeptical to buy a wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non existent that being said the china i received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay my opinion of wuhan has been raised quite a bit i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it what i like about this one is how the release lever works on the cannon the lever was vertical this made actuating it a less natural motion with this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use an argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but i have had no issue with it aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well good deal quite the steal if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal im sure it will be amazing and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal those are pretty crucial to a drumset nice cymbal better price i m no metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag double bass pedal has a quality build solid frame quiet mechanism easy to build and breaksdown for transport solid attachment to bass drum easy to adjust with reversible mallets as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value
520	they work its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage ive done it it sucked worth every penny these strings are great sounding and great looking on the fretboard because they are bronze one issue i had was the th and th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head but it still wound up very nicely i would actually say that you might want to get the extra light gauge but it s probably just my tuning machines they kind of suck i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks they are so grippy i haven t broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so it s hard to loose them but i still do if you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while you re playing they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the mm picks for that for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do it is very will made has the ernie ball logo on it and works just fine this mic is great i have one i have used from coast to coast to coast to coast unbeatable in price and quality you can t go wrong with a brand name like shure i have had mine for years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box you will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal as a veteran bluseman i recommend it it rocks as clean as a marsh possum i have finally discovered that the perfect set is a moving target as arthritis creeps in i find myself playing heavier strings with a lower action and these work in that respect another advantage of usiung this set is that it beefs up the treble side without making the bass side too boomey telecaster anyone i haven t had an issue with this cable yet and the guage of the wire connecting the plugs is very thick and high quality but it takes a while for them to stop coiling up like the title says the timeless combo of neutrik mogami is better if you re wondering how to get neutrik mogami cables cheap make them yourself it saves you so much money this pedal is beyond loud it s to the point where if you crank this pedal with a watt amp with an speaker you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood to match it up with the clean tone that i get out of my amp i have to set the level in between and i like to hit things i use drums so nobody else gets hurt i need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not say local wildlife these have the sweetest tone for battery based abuse thanks vic also flammable through my ampeg bass amp the low e string gets distorted when you push the bass control above and the upper strings sound kind of plain great strings they last longer than some of the others and easy to re string the guitarother brands do not seem to stand up to ernie balls they were a little too much for the squier bullet i put them on even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck while i had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness more metal moving over a guitar pickup hotter sound more gain and on a stratocaster more glass and bell like tones i ve used ernie ball s slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades they never break they stay in tune after stretching and they sound great lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound fun fact get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery there is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound ringing out of your amplifier a little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent you don t really need an expensive sustain pedal unless you re a concert pianist playing on a k keyboard nuff said when you extend it out all the way it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom but other than that this stand is perfect weak sounding and break very easily i would not recommend these to anyone other than those who literally have no callus developed i got this for christmas last year as a beginner learning guitar this is a must have works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadn t had to replace the battery s yet and i tune my guitar every time i play well worth it its so easy to use this keyboard sounds good but the inability to go below that low e is just killing me the speakers are good buy a good sustain pedal m audio sp sustain pedal with piano style action for keyboards been playing for five decades now used to tune with a tuning fork then later used a boss tu for years now the snark comes along and the boss tuner reliable and true sits in the bag with other accessories i use but it has no need to come out the snake took it s place no need to unplug from the amp and then plug the tuner in fast and easy the readout is easy to see in any light working off the vibration of the string via the guitar makes this an accurate tuner as some pickups will have too great a signal for a standard tuner and give a false reading not with the snark small handy the list goes on but i think you get the point it works well very long battery life easy to see oh and did i mention accurate yeah i think i did i was really looking forward to receiving this amp i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight unfortunately from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser like effect to the sound i tried different basses with it i tried different cables with it i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase shifter sound came out i tried all different knob and eq settings as well nothing helped so i m returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don t think less of ampeg at least not yet i really hope it s a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful for it s packed with cool features like an effects send a cd in a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice it also just looks cool and very pro my intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here i have to say buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label if there is a choice between amazon com and other vendors and even if amazon is a couple bucks more i recommend using amazon the customer service is so easy and immediate it s worth the piece of mind i ll update this review when i get the new amp later this week i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received see below this cable was very affordable but you get what you pay for it sounded brilliant while it wasn t broken for about the hours of runtime it works if it isn t abused at all but if you abuse it in any way at all your out an xlr cable i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage
521	i have quite a few guitars and i like to keep them clean and polished this stuff is great for my fretboard and i use it every time i change the strings i am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide this one works fine so far it is rather heavy and i like that i also like that because it is metal if you drop it on the floor it is not going to break like my glass one did be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger my buddy used this for a long time so i thought i d give it a try shines up guitars very nice i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz it does it s job in fantastic fashion but doesn t last the longest the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts it doesn t twist up like my standard black cable does but it will twist a bit over time love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn t just stick right out there if you really want to avoid on stage kinks then you must go wireless it is the only way to avoids twisted cables no matter what type you buy this cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion it s worth spending a jackson imo
522	i haven t used it a lot yet but i really like it so far much easier to put on than the year old capo i was using and it works for my guitars and my banjo without putting them out of tune it seems to be solidly made as well and not too much pressure as others said my old capo put a lot more pressure than this does p and was much heavier i d assume it was made out of cast iron or something instead of aluminum these are great for all around playing i ve never received a bad stick from amazon these are reasonably priced and so much more convenient than going to guitar center and having to deal with the idiot in the drum room i have a wide variety of vic sticks that i bought here on amazon another favorite is the bn it s a log with a nylon tip great for heavy metal thrashing very articulate good music to all mine came flattened in a little box i wasn t happy that its form was deformed well in a few days it popped back into shape so i didn t have to ship it back a good sign i am using it for both some music and computer stuff the bag is well made considering its price you cannot even get a backpack for this price i love its depth a number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded this is a solid depth and cozy padding around it for protection be sure to check out all the dimensions though its very long i was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it i think i saw micro and thought shorter not only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack i m thinking of getting another because of this the only minus is that i wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder paper slot but these are just wish list items finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited lucky this is a good option if you re a musician there are those things that you gotta have on a regular basis and for guitar strings are one of those things i give these stars rather than just because i know there are better strings out there however these ones are great i like the sound they provide and the price is nice this strap is cool it is black made of nice material with gel padding and it velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros where i once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap now i feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever adds about lbs to the weight of your guitar get it if your strap isn t feeling good other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss this one is legit someone snagged the first one they must have wanted it more than i did the first one worked great and so does this one i would recommend this product to everybody bwarrrrngarooroorooroorooroororooro beoooooooooooghreaeaughneneeeneeeneeeneeeneeneeneneneee meedlemeedlemeedlemeedleleelelelelemememememe wee weee weee weeeweeeweeeweeeeweeee doooobleeedooobleeedoobleddoo dszchewieeeeenrarraaarraararrraararara derrroughroo roor orroo roo roo roo roo rooroo juh juh juh juh juh juh juhj uh sqweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooorrrgh du du duh duh hendrix bro this arm fit my mexican strat perfectly i then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price i firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return the only problems is that i m not sure i can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that i made on my guitar investment i might have to sell one of my lexuses lexi what the hell is the plural of lexus
523	the only negative to this well made capo is i wish the tension was slightly less i find that once placed notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure it will work out just fine though and i will just have to make a few adjustments in tuning to correct for this love the quick release system i just hook on one end to the guitar and the other to a strap perfect for use when you are standing and playing i can just quick release it when i m done please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i would definitely buy these strings again they are high quality great durablity and a great price the martin name is synonymous with quality not too hard not too soft my friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using mm everyone has their own preference and i just didn t like the feel of those i bought this pack and they are awesome i lost like already but hey there s more i use them for my electric and acoustic guitar i started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck i found that i needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the g th both are very good i did notice that if i had a wider neck i think i am mm at the nut on my two takamines the may be a bit short they work and are cool looking i have aa adjustable planet waves that also works great cheaper ones also work this is real bone the length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar it is just my luck that i have some sandpaper in my garage so i sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about minutes of sanding
524	if you have really large or heavy speakers you might want to consider professional grade stands but these will work fine for any speakers under lbs or so maybe more if you keep them lower down they look nice and are easily worth their selling price they do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers so you ll have to figure out what you need and buy those things separately i don t have any real praise or complaints about this i does just what it should and for the price it s pretty good like most pedals it can be used with a v plug in transformer but it s not included yes it s made of plastic but you can t expect any more for i was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solid state amps so i ordered a vht special six supposed to be the best small tube amp for blues harp i also ordered a peavey kb solid state keyboard amp then i ordered this pedal and three others graphic equalizer mxr carbon copy delay t rex reverb i figured that i would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo well everything is being returned except this pedal i found that when i plug this pedal into my old watt peavey rage i get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals more tube like sound than a top rated tube amp and if i want a cleaner tone i can dial it back or bypass it altogether my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery you must use a v transformer which is not included oh well my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway yes it is made of plastic but if you are reasonably careful that should not be a problem update i just found that by plugging into both the high and low jacks at the same time on the vht amp it now produces the sound i will keep the vht and use it instead of my peavey rage with this pedal the sound from either set up is pretty close but the vht requires less fooling around with adjustments and is more resistant to feedback i still might keep this pedal though cause it s easily the next best thing to the vht special tube amp put this on my cheap acoustic guitar and it looks so good i might have to upgrade my guitar not much else to say about it it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do this is an excellent choice if you re looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint it looks great it s easy to use and it s a fantastic size for a delay pedal the analog delay is nice and warm much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays there is a internal adjustment that i don t think i will need to use for now anyway i highly recommend it this is probably obvious to more experienced musicians but for amateur musicians like me if you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play then you re fooling yourself you have to listen to your mix by recording it then listening while you re not playing singing
525	i bought a string one in blk love it for simplicity and needed it so i didn t have to keep searching for the other got gold to remind me it is for six strings wonderful and inexpensive strap i use these for all my electrics and have had no problems well made and easy to adjust i bought this for my takamine egsf sc acoustic electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well i am very happy with the low price i got and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case it has exceeded my expectations
526	better than i expect i going to order more very stable easy to assemble and a nice price for the price this is a wonderful strap it can get twisted and wear out but keep it straight and it will last you a long time it has a vintage look very soft and comfortable it also has that vintage fender coolness factor i have year old leather straps that will be around years after i m gone but i paid a lot for them and they re not as comfortable as this i ve even used these on gibson s oh the shame but of course they look best on fender s i guess the truth is they will work on anything the strap ends are great but they re not really secure gaskets can take care of that i own quite a few of these are they re great quality look cool in a vintage kinda way and feel soft on my shoulder heavy construction in layered leather there is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking i will buy another in a second color i had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method good picks though
527	it beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better it slips off if you go too fast but i thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this it didn t come with much of any instructions so i was using it wrong at first there is a big and a small slot the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use the cutter works great you just have to be careful the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better all and all it s one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master i hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesn t scratch the chrome off my turner pegs that and maybe they could use a long screw and some loctite to keep it from coming loose and well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find everything i have seems to be jet black you know when a good quality item arrives everything looks and works just as it is intended i love it these d addario medium acoustic guitar strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point the strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our auto tuner and have held up well highly recommendedcfh good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by over the months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house the guitar could take that head dive of death while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse my advice unless you plan to sit and play which you wont really need a strap anyways the whole time spend alittle more to get a leather strap spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play this came today and i must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly my takamine acoustic electric fits perfectly and is very stable on the stand i have confidence this will never tip over on its own you d have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over anyone with less than or stars must be a paid shill this is built like a tank and should last a lifetime it is adjustable the neck fully padded and the two arm base piece swivels for a custom fit the stand takes seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport a great case didn t really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about holds my seagal s very well great guitar by the way for the price but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy the padding is done very well i read some mixed reviews about the unit but i ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price
528	simple to use works well on the squier strat i m not much of a guitarist so this is my first capo and i don t have anything to compare with but the quality is way up there surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable works well with polish on natural wood instruments i plan to get another one for my laptop computer because of it s cling quality to dust i love these strings i get a much higher output much better response and much better sound great strings for just a little more
529	got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great price was right i already own two and had no problems quiet no hummmmm buy it if you need a wall wart for you can t go wrong its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere i write and record my own music i stink at writing drums i don t play drums i don t really have room for a drumset and i really don t want to spend the money on a drumset to see if i can figure it out this is a great program for non drumming one man bands like me midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasn t cutting it it works with ableton live with no problems tons of different grooves it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset very easy to use it does a fantastic job i ve had it for almost a year now still works as well as the first day perfect condition
530	daddy s never let you down i like their longevity too i don t switch til one cuts so they last as cheap as i actually am can t say i ve tried all of the capos in the world but i ve had my share of the different designs first i had the bungee cord type then i had the snap on type then i had the different capos designed for acoustic or classical or electrical this one by far evolved from good design the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension the design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck all of the others i have tried use a spring that could pop out one actually did and the entire capo came apart this one even has a pick holder built in it is light weight just the right size i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar while the tascam us audio interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included cubase le software i am not a novice at home recording as i have used many devices from track cassettes to protools setups over the years here is a rundown of my disappointing experience plugged into my ipad using the camera kit usb connector got device not compatible with ipad message too bad but i can still use my art usb interface which works quite well with garageband installed driver on my old g mac running opened garageband got no input message could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os if i get a new computer i will update my review until then i m disappointed at about twice the price of their standard strings these d addario nyxl strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability higher breaking point and something called fusion twist which i swear is a rare chubby checker b side having just put a set of these on one of my guitars i can t speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings but i can say they are solid dependable strings with lots of punch and crunch
531	same kind that come on all guitars from the fender factory classic sound i have switched to d addarios to capture that frusciante sound i wasn t quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards i figured i d give this a try i am so glad i did i could not believe how much residue was on the rag after i cleaned the fret board yuk then i used the treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color i d like to say it looks like new but the guitar is a so that would be a stretch but it looks a heck of a lot better almost new i used it on one of my less valuable acoustics but it s still a usa made fender i have such faith in this that i m going to do my gibson acoustic next then i have a couple of electrics i will do when i change strings on them this stuff is great good sized holder i placed it between the tuners it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time just enough tension to hold the picks not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them highly recommended really a nice mic i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio i record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs makes my voice sound fantastic i read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders and it certainly does for mine worth a shot if you re on a budget like me i ve got two other levy s cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they re fantastic i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what i had bought before i suppose it s just easier for theno big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and you re a big guy like me and or you play with the guitar bass around your knees you may not be getting what you thought in any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last our teenager really likes these as a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers have not broken one yet
532	wanted it just on looks alone it is a nice looking cord i know it will perform as for sam ash this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my roc n soc his shipping team do great work never any complaints from me i love sam ash thanks amazon with a nice clean crisp sound inexpensive price and durable history i ve made these strings apart of my acoustic set i ve got at least spares at home right now xd they play well and hold up well never had one break they are my second favorite pick but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite these picks work well and look as pictured the shade of pink is very close to that in the picture i would recommend them once you get the hang of this capo it s wonderful it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension i have several guitars but the one that i love using this capo on has a hard v neck it s pretty accurate on that neck up to the th fret nice product worth the investment now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it a little patients sanding the saddle to fit my vintage guild better fit than the plastic original that it replaced and the sound expanded beyond my expectations i also replaced the bridge pins with tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone these are great picks and yes they are slippery the reason is the material and method of manufacturing delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions these are probably the brightest sounding picks i have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them i use the mm for s on my solid body electrics mm for my s on semi and hollow bodies and mm on my bass guitar that s right i use a plectrum on my bass you can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like nylon
533	what my headline says it does exactly what it s supposed to do removes those annoying popping p s out of your recordings until you can afford a sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than you re going to need this and the price was right too i m impressed with these exp guitar strings what i expecteda more dead sound than the non coated strings they replaced coated strings usually lack the bright high end brilliance that uncoated light strings have what i gota very bright yet not to twangy sound when i put light strings on my acoustic i m going for easy playability and most of all a very bright and airy sound these deliver on both counts durabilitythe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes so far they are holding their tone and brightness i will report back after three months my last set started to sound dull and exhibit more tone variation after six months when viewed with a very sensitive tuner it seems that my dirtier strings detune sharp a bit more on attack the harder you strum them this is confirmed by the fact that they just sound out of tune to me when they get dirty conclusioni will be ordering more of these i think they perform very well for the price love the bright light gauge sound and playability quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much great useful product well made quite and lots of use to view of my floor effects works great and no other noise from it buy it i ve used d addario strings for a long time been playing yrs and have always been satisfied with their tone the balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension do i fully understand how this works nope but they sure do sound good their feel is a little more snappy than regular xl s in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well their sound is bright just like their xl cousins i think it s more of a feel thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instruments all in all a great product that i recommend to any electric guitarist
534	these strings are great for a string i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel a string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar and i think they will last longer which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring most ax tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should psychoacoustics being what it is i can t honestly tell you for sure electro harmonix tubes are measurably better than the no name chinese tubes i replace but i think the electro harmonix tubes sound better therefore they do at per shot who cares i suppose i could contrive a double blind experiment to settle the existential question empirically but i d rather spend my time playing rest assured electro harmonix is good stuff and the price is right just do it it s perfectly fine for standard fairly stationary use we use these at my church and they get moved around a little bit but not much for the price they are surprisingly solid and they work perfectly fine of stands in this price range this is at the top of what i ve experienced it s easily adjustable the screws stay tight once adjustments are made it s light but not so light that it tips or blows over the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling seriously for those who don t need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around this is the one to go with if you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and or going on tour shipping around in airplanes or vans etc you will need to go up a notch or two in quality and sadly price in my years of playing the guitar i have settled on d addario as my string of choice when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy i m really glad i did the tone is great they re durable and smooth on the fingers even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell like tone that mandolinists are after they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock i have a high end washburn f style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good this is the pack to get thanks d addario for providing an awesome product i am a pro drummer and run pro sound support pa systems for outside venues as well from time to time it is essential that i have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds these ft xlr cables are made well i hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths and as usual dealing with gls and orange county they came fast packed well and safe i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service and though on this particular order i had no need to contact them they checked in with me to make sure everything went well great folks to deal with i couldn t believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price especially given what i paid for it this case is unbelievable velvety cushioning inside heavy duty outside and a little compartment for picks or capos i can t fit much else in there but i don t really need to a few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze at first i didn t think my ibanez mandolin fit in here but when i finally applied some pressure it went right in now that i ve been using the case for a while it seems broken in and i don t have to fight it so much to get it to close the only downside is that after a few uses the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge i used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it s on the bottom it s not very noticeable but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through i didn t take a star away for that as it s purely cosmetic and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin i can forgive some tape on the edge in this case i still got more than my money s worth
535	cut the strings like they was made of paper really good price did what it was suppose no need to say anymore this stand is a little difficult to open the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it just as the others have said its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage its a perfect fit for fender squire j bass i also got my samick cr short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for short scale bassesbut im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and i would buy it again
536	i use dunlop orange because the thickness is perfect i hit the strings very very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet i don t break many strings great capo i ve tried a lot of other capos including some pretty expensive brand name capos and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings with how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky even for a right angle but they still sound good its a must have for guitarist with multi effects it comes with a range of wires but i did not like that you camt use the last two ports together the ac ports other than that it good tried these on les paul style with jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about different pedals metal overdrive echo reverb fuzz etc so keep in mind that they haven t broken in yet as i do this review but i do feel confident in what i report here they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels on the high gain metal muff fullbore guytone metal monster swollen pickle and big muff they sound really nice a lot of harmonics and output captured for that stars easy i don t think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold other s may feel differently i am sure then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output so you are getting what they say however for a warm bluesy tone i couldn t get anywhere close to my sound like i can with the pure nickels for that star average to i guess forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment for shredding go cobalt for warm woman tone go pure nickels that s pure folks i also really like the d addario pures also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel hope this helps
537	i bought the mm picks i would consider them medium thickness if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness the mm is right for me i really like them works as advertised i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work pretty simple even if you re technically challenged easy to use haven t gigged with it yet but i can imagine that this strap isn t going anywhere regarding its functionality not a pretty product but good stuff once you get the hang of this capo it s wonderful it takes a bit to get used to squeezing it to the correct tension i have several guitars but the one that i love using this capo on has a hard v neck it s pretty accurate on that neck up to the th fret nice product worth the investment now i just have to figure out how to keep up with it this thing is awesome i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it it has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar and one that restsin the case up by the headstock i ve been playing for about years and have always used a humidifier this works just as good as anything else keeps my case at a nice humidity i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too just to make sure you have the proper humidity level update so being the lazy guy that i am i never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hard well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gel like feeling so i am convinced that they work now
538	the first thing i do when i get a new instrument is put a straplok on it before gigging with it they re easy to install i haven t had one fail on me yet i have straploks on nine instruments right now and i just ordered another for my new bass i can t recommend them highly enough this is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should there s nothing else to say but to get it if you need it the quality doesn t suck so don t worry about peace out this strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff the only issue i have with it is that the ends are not the same size so i could not install my dunlop straploks for it it may just have been the one i got though wow very cool gadget and well executed this review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks i have not tried it with other stringed or non stringed instruments the thing is quick and accurate the display colors are bright and easy to read it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing in fact if you play a chord it will usually guess the root note of the chord it clips on easily and firmly it is very sensitive i find that i have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work but i can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune usually without having to pluck it again before i have it right as an added bonus in my case the color happens to be a great match for an epiphone sg g in cherry red exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though design looks great in the light too
539	has everything you need to keep fretboard in condition works well seems to hold up well also treatment lasts for awhile emery cloth for polishing frets is nice worth for sure this was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on it s easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops i recommend it to all aspiring musicians i bought an extension for it and so this plug has allowed me to stop using eight batteries hard not to like that this simple tool helps protect my guitar from scratches when i m changing strings or just cleaning it up it s a foam cushion with a neck supporter it rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage well worth it
540	i ve been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over years ago i use both electric and acoustic the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will every once in a while i ll get a dead string i ll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge same thing with strings that break while tuning them up changing strings on a string less often fantastic and the sound is good i didn t expect this much volume from light strings the tone of the strings lasts about months in my experience but that will depend on how much playing you get in this is hands down the best guitar stand on the market it will last a lifetime and never drop your axe i have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and i love them all if you like jazz guitar picks and if you like tortex picks this is the perfect marriage these are the best enjoy i bought this for my taylor it seems to keep things humidified very well i like the idea that it takes moisture out and puts moisture in as needed i have replaced packs twice i have not had any problems with the packages leaking or creating any problems in the guitars i bought this to complement a ce ltd fall guitar and wanted to have something that would last a long time and provide a nice suede feel to keep the strap from sliding around on my shoulder it took a little bit to get the hole over the butt peg of the guitar it almost seemed the slit they cut was too small after working at it a few minutes i got it to fit and it wore really nicely once i got the length where i wanted taking it on off the guitar isn t too much trouble but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more enough to make it easier to get it on i m glad that it came a little tighter initially the leather stretches over time and it s clear they had that in mind when they make these the quality is excellent and i m buying another one to go with my string taylor this tuner is great best buy works so well i highly recommend this tuner can t buy a better tuner for less money
541	use this alot on all kinds of electronics it gets crackling knobs going again i ve use it for years recommend have had one for years has survived many gigs and rehearsals and many months in the trunk of my car harsh environment i love these things they hold your guitars in place and make this storage solution a nice decoration in the process i love the dual bulb design the clamp slid around a bit on my music stand overall i like the design and flexibility accidental turn on in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem i m sure i ll need to find a way to protect the product from breaking since it seems like it would not stand a chance on its own in my gig bag what can i say i love this thing i bought three more after trying the first one i put one in each of my guitar bags can t live without it the tuning is excellent and so easy if you are hesitating buy it and you will love it
542	i was concerned when i bought this that my microphone stand would be prone to tipping over since there isn t a counterweight however not only does this thing lock in tight and not slowly tip down like other boom stands i ve used in the past but it hasn t tipped over yet after quite a bit of use works exceptionally well in fact this works better than regular single layered pop filters i have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice well worth the money the build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands great mount for the price filter attached to mount is great idea saves space and simplifies mic stand setup quality good especially given fairly low price
543	go build your own build it to your specs and have a solid stand if not you can find a lot better head stands this one was a huge disappointment does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick im back with my wood block and am happy the product arrived as in the description but i made the mistake to buy it for my fender squier bullet not a full strat there are differences between this pickup covers and my fender squier first the magnet tips in the squier are closer together i guess the fretboard is narrower than the strats second the squier s has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup my solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent not the most beautiful thing but worked the other parts knob backplate and tips fit perfectly what is there to say if you re looking at this cable then you must have some knowledge of tone loss simple if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal buy mogami i have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches mogami sure you can buy the expensive analysis plus pro and evidence audio cables but you will not hear a difference lifetime warranty and you won t be replacing it any time soon works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio all i own are mogami cables check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord goodbye pops and noise tis pedal really did for me what i wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines i don t mess with the noise gate so i can t really comment on that but everything else is first rate i have a love hate relationship with compressors for you can t go wrong with this one i use it a lot on my practice rig if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley knob i use a keeley in my live shows expensive but worth it as for this joyo i can t complain it does it s job pretty good but it does color your tone some what true bypass is nice it s noticeable in your chain but not to much to take it out i love for my practice rig good buy if you re on a budget all us musicians are just don t expect to blown away by it for give it a shot i did and don t regret it
544	i could not beat the price the pedal does what is suppose to do on my dynamic wah guitar pedal it is well build and i can use it on other boss and roland gear also it not to big it does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board very happy with this item for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install you will like them on the guitar being new to guitar this is just way too much fun makes my playing acutally sound like i may know what i am doing easy to setup and easy to use i ve been using hosa cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced i particularly like the right angle plug it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars that s still not a problem because i simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables i m very pleased with it and recommend it as an old school guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous with a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at definitely too large for our practice studio and a bit too heavy to lug around i researched every multi effect unit on the market today decided the me was the best way to go for me mainly for the manual settings when i received the unit it came out of the box ready to go other than installing batteries and worked exactly like i had my rig shrunk down into a rugged small package cosm with the amp simulation pre amp portion i don t need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knob effects boss is the boss of effect pedals in my opinion this unit combines everything i need then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking i do not venture into the unit s ability to remember settings because every venue i gig at has different acoustics constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones i want to hear love these things i feel a little guilty because i put a pair on my epiphone les paul plus top i also have them on my fender marauder and now i can easily swap straps between guitars and i m secure in the knowledge it s not going to land on my foot yeah you could put one of those plastic dunlop pick looking things on a regular strap to keep it in place but these look and feel so much cooler they use a quick connect of the kind found in natural gas and compressed air connectors pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release i put them on a dipinto mach v with that levis rat fink guitar strap i need to exchange i use this on all my guitars i tried some off brands and i ve found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal
545	the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on i am a fan of the slinky guitar strings so i got these for my freetless schecter string bass like they were made for it i gave it a star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks but this ft cord is taller than i am which means it s about tall it s a great product for the money exspecially if it s just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp it s short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working the zt lunchbox is some sort of new technology that allows loud and good sounding tone to come through a box the literal size of a lunchbox i was amazed at how small the amp was when i first purchased it tiny then i was amazed at how loud it could be and still have clean headroom others have reviewed and written about a hissing sound but i have not had a problem with that after trying it with guitars passive p u s active p u s and acoustic electric it remains nice and quiet i have been using it as a practice amp as well as in a band setting now here s the thing it does not have a lot of bass frequency to it but i noticed that setting it on the floor does help some but still not enough if you re looking for that heavy metal scooped sound so i would not recommend it for you metal heads out there however for all you jazzers and rockers the tone knob makes a big difference i keep my tone at about a o clock setting because i prefer a little darker sound and it has enough mids to cut through the mix nicely still bottom line i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it stars i don t think you will be dissappointed super usb mic i use this when i broadcast from streetjelly com i set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal just make sure you have all your mic levels set to not clip and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic
546	this arrived and when i tried to use it it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter instead these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip this is such a standard item that there is no excuse for making it with non standard threads and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard ths very comfortable bench it s wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use it feels heavy duty and stays still during use this product is exactly what they say it is good material decent padding nice front pocket zippers function without issue my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at home and this works great definately worth i chose this because i wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings so far it has worked beautifully got this for a year old learning guitar they thought the guitar was fine before the tuner my how things change when you can see what is really going on recommended when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it at first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and i figured the plastic would soon break i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either i have used this for a couple of months now switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well i may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner it works as well as my expensive model i was using and i don t have to stick it on the guitar body worth checking out
547	wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh some people pay for silver and expect gold okay so i bought this because i do app review videos for a blog and my blue snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard p hard t hard b s and a few others so i got this here are my pros and cons pros it works i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter the pop sound is completely removed with the filter which means it does what it was designed to do stars it does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech d it looks nice attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product it doesn t really matter since i work from home and not in a public place but it s nice to know i can show it to people and it looks nice the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface so mounting this to say a desk probably won t be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic i don t know why people think this isn t sturdy i mean you re not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing the build quality is quite excellent considering that it s fragile screens attached to plastic and metal cons it s pretty big i used to shorten the stem on my blue snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage i can t do that anymore with this pop filter on it now it s become a permanent member of the front of my desk outside of this thing doubling the space my snowball takes up i have no complaints about this pop filter it works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good this should be the last pop filter i have to buy for a long time ever since i started playing the guitar i ve used the nylon dunlop picks they re better in a thicker size mm or larger but the mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick they re flexible and easy to pick with but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will not break you d almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears also of note the price keeps going up on these here on amazon for some reason don t pay more than for a pack of them as you can get them at your local music store for about that this stands up and holds the microphone in place the stand is study easily adjustable and withstands the rigours of use use to record my music works great on vocals and instrument together or separate i like the deep tones and wide range of pick up it grabs everything so you need to be careful of background get it if you are even thinking dont forget phantom power is needed
548	work very well nice low profile easy push button on and off but it is true not good for thick straps and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use ever since i started playing the guitar i ve used the nylon dunlop picks they re better in a thicker size mm or larger but the mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick they re flexible and easy to pick with but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will not break you d almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears also of note the price keeps going up on these here on amazon for some reason don t pay more than for a pack of them as you can get them at your local music store for about that ernie ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician community these strings are affordable and last a very long time on someones guitar during normal use you will not be disappointed in this product they sound very clean and bright and if you use a product like ghs fast fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longer they do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly
549	have to try them more and with other amps by now they work really good and no interference where detected at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot these are the second planet waves cables that i own and the first ones are still in great conditions it really nice made in canada not china wow that alone impressed me like the other here reviews it is not soft it is stiff material yes you can bend it it will probably last life times ends are made of leather one advantage is that once you set it to the appropriate length it will not change easily if your switching to different size guitars this could be a problem cause you can t make an on the fly quick adjustment on stage you will be wrestling with it i had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack it never sounds thumpy or unnatural but always musical i really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like
550	nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging i bought this because i had already bought a spot plug but as i gained pedals i needed something to power them without buying more adapters and this is greatest way to solve that problem highly recommended i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space they work well and i haven t had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises i highly recommend them plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper cords hangs my guitar around my neck so i don t have to hold it there easily adjusted looks nice the pick pocket is handy overall this is a pretty good stand it is sturdy and has good adjustable heights a good value if you have lots of stuff you need to hang on it i took one star off because the bottom part is kind of awkward fro holding up the guitar as the guitar strap peg is at the very bottom and is the only thing touching the bottom of the stand which make sit easy to fall and i ve had it fall a number of times i m just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider also the edges of my guitars are always touching as if there is not enough room for them on the stand right product at the right price i have of these dang things layin around cause i never throw them out but never fails i need one i don t have to drive a zoom pedal to save on batteries and here it was this is actually my first experience with a biyang pedal i heard good things about the build quality but didn t end up with a biyang until i needed a reverb pedal turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal most of the popular options or and up at around the tri reverb has a distinct advantage in price but don t underestimate its quality as some other reviewers noted the reverb can get extremely deep and lush if you so desire i found myself with the blend and time knobs around for a practical spring reverb there s a multi switch for hall spring and room there are subtle differences between the three but i d be lying if i said they sounded dramatically different the a b switch isn t well explained but if you re in a mode the effect is much more dramatic i found that operating in b mode was similar to the type of reverb i had enjoyed on my amps note it has a stereo input and output but i only use one input output so i can t comment on that at the end of the day it s a fairly simple always on effect and the biyang does the job without costing a fortune but what makes it star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality having a thumb mini screw to open the v compartment instead of a plastic door or needing a phillips screwdriver is a big deal also love that the v jack is on the top of the unit away from the other jacks the pots are smooth and easy to turn and the mini switches and footswitch are boutique level quality this is a great reverb pedal i don t think i ll ever need another one
551	i like this product so much i buy them two at a time but i wish i didn t have to the problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me so it s like that guy who asks for a lighter uses it and puts it in his pocket every single time these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter i understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers it s a decent tool at a good price so buy one then see how long you can own it i use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty the sound is unbelievable thick and creamy sound lasts slmost weeks before the tone dies good price good strings it had been a while since i had some eb s best packaging i have seen and for the price don t order just one pack very pleased always have a spare pair in your case these snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick i use the mic instead of the vibration setting though that s my preference but i would use no other tuner on stage i have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars i have dozens of guitars this is an awesome amp there are so many settings on this amp you could spend hours with news sounds and effects so sick it s fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new sometime i want to get the pedal for this amp to preset effects i like great amp if you re just looking for something to either mess around on or practice with i play a lot of different songs on my electric guitars and this amp makes it really fun i would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player
552	i liked the strap used it for many years and it held up great the texture almost looks fake though great harmonica rack for smaller harps very strong in the set when worn a must have for any folk player this is a great product just not for me i found it brightened my tone way too much and i went back to plastic gave my guitar a bad metallic sound and i lost bottom end very big very cushioned i didn t notice that it helped all that much with the weight of my bass but helped a little almost thought it was a little too cumbersome kind of bit into my neck a little
553	there s some element of nostalgia with the ds that i ve just never understood i know they re cheap i know they re incredibly durable as are all boss pedals i know everybody had one or tried one at some point and kurt cobain apparently used them with his fenders but i also know that i ve almost never been happy with the tone i get when i step on the pedal it s incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way i ve used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers you can mess with the tone and dist dials all you want but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals and even on amp distortion with a richer deeper tone coincidentally i also used the boss os overdrive distortion for many years which is supposedly merges blends a ds with an od that pedal isn t ideal either but if i turn the knob all the way to distortion it s a much better tone than i ever got out of a ds then again it is very dependable and usually only or less so i can t really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone s collection that just doesn t mean you ll want to use it all the time i ve had this little amplifier for a few weeks and i couldn t ask for a better practice amp it s amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room but it ll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds it s rugged and portable and it s fun to play around with some of the effects the fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more if you re toating between practice with an instructor it s okay i purchased it for that reason and i m an adult so i can be careful this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent dirt but that s it there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price the boss ac is a serviceable acoustic simulator i am the only guitarist and in my playing environment children s church and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric the ac does that job although it has several modes the jumbo mode seems to be most useful played through a carefully eq d amp you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings there is an audible hiss less noticeable plugged direct into pa noticeable plugged into a good clean tube amp out of control with humbuckers or solid states the key to using this pedal is using it correctly first and foremost use single coils tested with a les paul with burstbucker pro s the hiss was overwhelming played with an american deluxe strat with n noiseless pups in the rd position it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel point two any form of gain will create a ton of hiss point three tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps tested through a frontman and vox pathfinder vs an orange tiny terror and fender hrd the ac is not a set it and forget it pedal based on the volume of the amp and the room you re in you will need to tweek the eq to find that tone i ve read that you can use an eq pedal to get the same tones i haven t found that to be the case if your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch or in my case as the only guitar player to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly this is a great fit stars for ever present hiss for actually sounding like an acoustic when it s eq d correctly tried several of pedaltrain in the past pt too bulky and pt jr a little to small this one holds my pedals perfectly simple light i love it i don t gig it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd but if you re like me play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres this amp is a blast it is very likely that i will play a johnny cash song on tuesday and a metallica song on wednesday pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound no pedals no hours of minor tweaks just punch it up and learn the song virtually every genre is represented here i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it i prefer traditional r n r sounds and the spider iv recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds even with the best modeling in the world my les paul does not sound like a strat being played through fender it sounds digital no getting around it something else that weighed into my purchase was durability although i only play for fun i still play hours a day my year old also is learning to play so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily the one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of line amps was that they were long lasting and durable i have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger just becuase they can take such a beating ultimately i decided that for the price at the time i couldn t beat the line there is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp they sound better more prefessional they are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes although the line sounds tinny and at max volume for in home play it sounds terrific there are mountains of reviews that compare the line to vox marshall or fender they are all better than the line every one of them but be prepared to pay times the price for effects pedals head units cabinets cables etc to get those flawless professional sounds good amp great value i had to tune my guitar and i bought this well it works great i got the sound i wanted
554	we added this as an extension to our clubhouse pa system it s very nice quality has a range of easily adjustable stops and provided excellent ability for both short and tall speakers this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly although not through amazon com i recently purchased a seagull s original acoustic guitar i compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range as well as with the seagull entourage acoustic electric which was also in the general price range the s has a nicely consistent tone which although maybe a little too bright for some players tastes projects very well some reviewers and guitarists with whom i ve talked wonder how seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in north america for the price i think that i found part of the answer when i looked inside some of the seagulls the braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it though you d never know i find the neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left hand fingering it s a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width for me it works some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar seagull does offer other models by the way that have a more traditional width the slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering but not so short as to cause floppy strings i couldn t be happier with the seagull s especially for the price perfect for my obscure use i discarded the mic clip or more so added it to my collection and attached a ram mount to the gooseneck now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post what to do with it i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights no more holding a little phone sized thing up to my face for hours on end this stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it this thing is great in theory but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesn t have a guitar resting in it it does well at its job when it s in use i e it doesn t fall when there s a guitar but i think i ll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it s lying in wait i have the older version of this as well this newer one the older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way like banjos mandolins sometimes this new one just won t hear the string being tuned unless it s encouraged that wasn t the case with the first model it s not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate the buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it you could find the tuning being done several semi tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons the older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices and these won t clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock but if you get it well clamped it will stay there in the case or in use the price is great the sound is good the power jack however leaves a little to be desired my standard boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal x easier than any other pedal i ve now secured it with tape so it should be ok based on other reviews my guess is that i just got a dud and that most of them are okay
555	martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar they last and they stay in tune sound very good too it is a basic music stand but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements you can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store great value i like using these strap ties far more than i do tying a strap to the neck they are a great idea i found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap but eventually got it on i have two of these and i use them i d definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn t like tying on their guitar straps
556	one of the my favorite thigns about strats is how easy they are to modify customize after about years with my american standard i was itching to change up the look so i changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers i didn t need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts i wanted seperately the back plate is a single ply mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories this will give you a matching back plate you can never go wrong with real fender parts i got two sets of these tunners my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now i love them good upgrade fender vintage springs use of them in my case and they work well i would recommend this i ve been a fender player since i first picked up the guitar i ve used different strings from d darrio to ernie ball and now i always use fender strings for stratocasters i always use super bullets and for telecasters i use super s the only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the s the bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a strat i don t use the tremolo very much so i don t know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super s i figure i might as well get the ones that are designed for the strat also these are the oem strings that fender installs at the factory so you can t go wrong with that i highly recommend them i ve been using ernie balls cobalt slinky light gauge because i like the feel i got these from the vine and wow they are awesome they cost no more than the strings i normally get but the tone and feel is totally different i can t comment on how long they ll last or keep in tune but for now i m impressed i ll probably keep using these on my santana prs for awhile since i like the sound every once in awhile i ll step outside of my box i mean i know the strings that i like and i tend to stick with them i use d addario on my acoustic guitars and ernie balls on my electrics except for my strat i like fender bullets on it so the sample from the vine sorta of nudged me and i m the better for it
557	martin makes great sounding strings i decided to use light martin strings because they sounded louder and better and i could play them just as easy as the lighter strings i ve tried leather straps i ve tried rocksteady straps i still keep coming back to this strap it s steady highly adjustable and it works very nicely with the dunlop dual design straplok system good job ernie ball i even prefer this to a nice levy s strap that i own because the ernie ball strap is a bit slipperier this capo is solid and well made i use it on my seagull acoustic and fender stratocaster no problems at all i ve played guitar for some years and have found d addario strings to be of consistently good quality they are one of maybe three companies i trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel their strings produce excellent sound and are durable like any string one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style that comes through reading reviews and quite often simply testing but i ve never played a set of this brand that i didn t like they always provide vibrant tonal quality and no i don t work for d addario just a long time fan
558	i bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that i use with my bass the degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non intrusive smart looking setup i m pleased i ve owned them for a few months now no issues at all and they look good well built the adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about or degree increments possible positions between upright and horizontal best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck i m using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the stand to give me a bit more room but there is no counter weight here so its best used at shallow angles if i was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar or if on stage energy has you moving a lot more i would opt for a boom stand instead this is one great looking cable i purchased this cable december and it is still working well and stilllooks good and as fernando lamas says it is better to look good than to feel good well not when itcomes to cables this cable is awg with an ultra pure copper center conductor and copper and conductivepolymer shield you want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud helps keep those ugly micro phonics away and you want that big time the capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is pf ft this is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables the lower the number the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output it seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed this seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money this cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style they look terrific but i find this fatso muchharder to coil than the thinner spectraflex vintage this company makes the bulkiness of this cabledoesn t seem to lend itself to easy coiling it also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage the easiest of my cables to coil by the way is the lava cable magma which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil if i were to need more cable quitehonestly i would buy the lava pretty doesn t count for much with me i gave this cable stars because of its very good sound is well constructed has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs looks darn marvelous and has about average specs for the money yet difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis if you want a beautiful well made cable that you don t have to put away every day buy this one these foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do and they do it just about average as you expect my only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis shaped upon delivery if your mike has a big enough ball the ball will reshape the foam otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth round look to it
559	i have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what i want it to it is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet turn in half way up you get a clean sound crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous i own a piece of the legend and music history everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well you have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after the string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise you wont be let down dunlop makes good quality products this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand it is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing only thing make sure you read the description well it is a euro stand so it has threads it does not come with a mic clip when i ordered my mic from behringer their clip had standard threads which obviously would not attach i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going overall i would buy again good medium picks decent feel and sound would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling girlfriend likes the colors hahaha i requested and received one of these as a christmas gift then bought another so i could keep the first one at a weekend place where i keep a guitar it works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings and keeps strings clean and rust free important here in humid florida and strings last longer than they did before i started using this even though i ve always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use i keep my slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc type bag because it s not airtight when you snap it together and i don t want it to dry out i hope when it does dry out that i can just add some juice to rejuvenate it i just don t know what kind of liquid to use i don t want to drop or so for a new one every time it dries out any ideas are welcome please add a comment to this review if you can help me out bottom line it extends the life of my strings and that s always good this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does holding my ipad i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice great product highly recommend
560	i don t believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo but this one is quite good for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use it does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built it is as with all capos important to take it off when not in use so the rubber does not get grooved this is just good common sense if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing and it seems to have made my fingertips slick so i have a hard time holding on to picks when i use them on upstrokes i m sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem but it s more fun to blame the pick these picks were no different from picks without the gator grip imho but gorilla snot worked beautifully it s cleaned and polished pretty my taylor guitar pretty well i would recommend this if not this one at least buy some kind of cleaner polish protect your investment it tunes without any problems and i love using the word snark i thought the creaters could have implemented the clip feature i have seen on other tuners which tunes through vibrations but it still works great
561	i like the product i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost i thought that it could hold a few more picks i think i putted about picks in it but hey it works and i would buy it again i forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar thats what i did it looks good and durable also it s cheap this is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a mixer rack or piano scissor stand the square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading the mic end of the mount works pretty good overall the only problems i found is that the up tube could be to taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer this particular brand i ve seen around and haven t heard to much about them but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they send another one in exchange that didn t work out so well with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one i d have to rate this one at the bottom never used this seller or site for this purpose before sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks they fit perfectly and i have used them on strat and a levinson blade not forgeting my ibenez easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service this seller is worth supporting thanks delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a fender product
562	i was surprised of how well this stand is made it s worth easily i ve used stands for over years and this is the best i ve owned a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item if you are a truly music chosen one i have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road i have not had this long enough to know if it will but so far so good works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking i chose this rating because even though it is an epiphone a les paul and affiliation with gibson it is made in china not the usa as one would think by the name affiliations i think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is not a usa product when opened the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but i did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case the white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory so someone messed up in quality control with that said i find the finished look is fine without the guard the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified i decided not to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it
563	just arrived in good shape polish w an expansive polishing cloth almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths nice quality fretboard oil has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way i would definitely recommend this worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard great product accurate small functional inexpensive better battery life to previous generations very good quality adapts easily to any type of guitar heads
564	i have several types of capos this one seems well built a little bulky for string banjo especially if you are fingering near it i really don t need to change that fast so use it very little might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off i bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week i don t ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are to me it looks weird but they sound so much better than my ancient strings that were on there i got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin sucked big time so we got this to use instead works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it i know everybody knows this already but i ve never played with a bow before most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers i got this for my ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck it took a few trys before i could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put even so it was a good quality button the leather is tough and will last for years it will probably outlast the guitar if you re looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit but it s really worth the hassle bought this cover to go with behringer mic it does what it s designed to do it was a little hard getting it onto the head of the mic but at least that way i know it s not going to be falling off during a performance or a recording session economical way to keep spit out of mic got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin added a couple drops and it worked like a charm a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin i bought this audio cable and all i gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble good stuff this item was purchased because i m doing self teaching on the fiddle i figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while i m learning since i m used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go i like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions i also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you want it did take some measuring to get this in place i had to be very careful to put it on squarely the closer i got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line but not so much that it would affect how to use the template one things i had to deal with was to make sure i had a mm measuring devise the bridge of the violin had to be mm from the nut it took some doing but i was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes
565	quick to clip on and off really is there anything else to say what else do you want it to do these suckers are wonderfully reliable i ve had one for about years the only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the bottom of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect however for a keyser sent me a bag of a about of them can you go wrong no great product i found this tool to be convenient and better made than i anticipated making it a solid value for the money no need for a collection of separate tools anymore this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them i love these picks i buy tons of them all the time if you are like me and prefer to just strum tunes on your acoustic then these are the picks for you i prefer thin picks for basic strumming as i am a beginner guitarist and they are more forgiving this is an excellent gig bag plenty of compartments for all of your accessories well padded and has enough carrying options a good buy this was a precent decent product i was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets otherwise besides that the cleaner itself is great i just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time i know it will live up to the finder name very easy to use
566	hosa makes good stuff this is no exception i ve trusted them for years i can t think if a single hosa cable i ve owned that s failed this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass i gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid i only use something different if i need a longer reach and i love the tweed cover very satisfied with this one no messing around fits well in bass tuner knobs spins well and the cutter is good this is the one to get while on the surface the pocket sounds great the picks either fall out because they aren t pushed in far enough or they are impossible to grab because they are pushed in too far there is also a tendency for the picks to fall out when you put the guitar on a stand which is a bit annoying the strap itself is just fine and is a good price but the pocket idea sounded better on paper than it works in real life this is the large i can t see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all the lines for the strings and frets are very close together i got this at a great price so decided to give a strobe tuner a try if you re accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it while it may technically be more accurate than the cheaper vibration tuners this advantage is of limited use given that the tuning of guitars still has to have some compromise from perfect in order to be well intonated one advantage over the clip on tuners by the way you can t beat snarks for the price is that because it is electronically connected to the guitar it is not affected but other instruments that may be playing at the same time i ve noticed that while trying to tune when playing live by clip on tuner seemed to get confused by other instruments i ve tried the fishman ft and the tune tech ttm i like this one the best it seems as accurate as my other tuners like all clip on tuners there are sweet spots on the head that work better than others oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner the snark was fine the biggest plus i see on the snark and the reason its my new go to tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen my vision isn t so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful i don t have to guess or squint it has a metronome which can be fun i personally don t use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so i don t want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when i really need it the only minus that i can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce i don t have a custom made brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing if you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you ll trust it if not then the fishman is more your speed these are great little tuners you can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly which is especially helpful when you re breaking in strings or any time i ve played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming so these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts
567	it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add much better than a standard clip on a mic this one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off since it s rubber if it does break has a lifetime warranty had a shure sm on a table on a stand in this clip pounded on the table only picked up the tap sound my hand has making and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise can t ask for more than that no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included the only place is on the box after you have received the item there s no instruction which is fine but in the product description it doesn t say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can t use it i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can t because it doesn t come with a mic clip which i have to spend another to get it plus shipping the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip but without it i felt cheated a must have for the yamaha pa you can plug ti in instead of using batteries that keeps the weight down tremendously and as long as yo have a plug youa re good to go i m a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves what does this add to the others well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo in other words it s freakin perfect so i d give it stars except it gets because that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius full marks you can t miss with this product
568	stars instead of only because this thing won t tune your guitar or carry your amp i use this solo in a duo with a bass player in a trio with drums and bass i have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room i use it through a pyle pro self contained pa into which i also plug my martin grp elec acoustic the sound quality is excellent the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out i would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and pa i haven t heard a hint of feedback and the on off switch is a plus the price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to i bought a toshiba flat screen for around bucks think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less the same is true of a lot of audio gear a lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it s great to have a company like shure make something so good and so affordable they have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford i cannot recommend it strongly enough i ve been using this bench regularly since ordering it in it s great in all ways but one the rubber feet constantly fall off if you use this bench regularly the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feet solution usegorilla glue epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench this is what i have done and now i have no problem with wandering feet on stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate make sure you have a good microphone to use with it the cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for that seems to be a common problem with music recording programs i ve seen heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer guitarist this should come with a good how to use course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications this unit works as advertised i ve used it to record my garage band shows making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds e g audience and any other background noise so if you want a more pure sound you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments microphones etc this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric i did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close
569	i bought this effect because i saw a few youtube demos that made it look pretty good i had always wanted an attack delay effect and the behringer slow motion was priced well below all competitors when it arrived i tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope it only works well under these circumstances all notes must be played slowly individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in you can t play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly having said that i found that the effect is nice once you have mastered the technique i tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal which i have not tried i considered returning the unit to amazon for a refund but i don t think that would be fair as it does work to some extent and it didn t cost me a lot of money in the first place however i do not think i would recommend it to a friend they said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you re playing up to three octaves but i could never get that feature to work properly from video reviews i ve heard on youtube this harmonizer does not even come close to the boss version but it costs about less since i am not a professional musician and i am just playing around with it it works just fine and you get what you pay for addendum i ve now owned this for a while and discovered that it can turn my six string strat into a bass by turning the balance knob all the way to the right and my pitch on the second from bottom position in fact when i record my dean edge bass onto the boss loop station and then record my strat on top of it using the behringer ultra shifter harmonist i cannot tell any difference in tonality i am thinking of selling my bass it has just become a needless expense needs the neck adjusted twice a year the strings are expensive and it is harder to play then my strat this product has a simple function but if you need a v adapter this is the one to get i trust the planet waves brand
570	these guitar picks are just the best simply put they are easy to grip onto even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day highly recommended i will never use any other guitar pick other than a dunlop tortex i use the green mm picks and also the orange mm ones i recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks great for beginners or the pros i did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area and look like i make very good choice this capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar it does not break and is very sturdy highly recommended this tuner is great and well worth the you will pay for it at most places but i ve seen it as high as and that is just a rip off not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar
571	works great its a good product just what i expected i expect to buy more of these in the future and for its price its well worth it microphone is quite good for such price the sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones recommend for small budget studios the item shipped in time it is working fine the sound is very good the only problem i had is voltage i live in europe and i had to buy special adapter which transforms volts to i know a lot of items from usa that work with both voltage and but not this one thanks anyway i have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal the kick mic s base is beginning to fall apart but i have used these things on the road all this brutal summer and the sound is still the same i have other more expensive mics but often use these in clubs as a backup when the drummer doesn t have a favorite or bring his own kick mic while it cannot stand up to say my favorite the d it does the job and the overheads are the easiest o h mics i have tried yet the tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece except for the kick mic mounting bracket after months of use i would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics update now that i have been using them for a while i can say they are reliable durable and sound good my akg drum mic kit sees more action than the pyle s but the pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs mic ing the kick drum mic s mount is falling off but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians they are in great shape these mics have more life left and i have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point
572	well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning am i impressed u bet cha this thing is simply beautiful it arrived well padded in a double box initially i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws none not a finger print on it anywhere this guitar is extremely well made and put together right it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter the neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities i put a quarter under the th fret and it s right on the money it s considerably heaver than than i thought i would imagine it weighs about lbs i have a strap ordered and on the way the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had your hand floats over the frets i don t think you could get a better piece for the price point at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar very well made of heavy metal framework has a very solid base the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar the top neck clasp keeps the guitar from tipping forward and the quick release really works probably the best stand i have been playing for over three decades and it has been a while since i have owned an electric guitar i bought this amp along with a epi les paul all i can say is wow this is a great combination this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects well built and looks even better in person than the picture plenty of power as well better than anything including the stage quality amps like marshals from back in the day a great practice amp but good enough you could use it for a small gig going to pick up the optional foot switch if you buy you won t be disappointed
573	i ve had one of these for about years have gigged with it extensively and i ve only had to replace it once more on that later i m not really a cork sniffer re guitar tone i think most of our tone comes from our fingers and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me i think this monster cable sounds fine better well better than what i don t really notice a difference when i use different cables maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies but it s so slight as to be negligible i look for guitar cables that will last that s what i really care about and so far this monster cable does the trick i use other brands too this is my most expensive cable but i think it was worth the i spent all those years ago oh and the return process this was maybe years ago i called monster they gave me their address and i had to pay about to ship it back to them about weeks later i had a new cable i consider that to be excellent customer service i saw this tuner in the local music store for and decided to order it here for within minutes i had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect i compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical i honestly expected some variance but it was dead on i have never heard my guitar sound so good i am super impressed with this little thing if ever i need another one this is the only one i will get this is a super easy to use pedal you just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset don t worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound if you really want to be able to tweak everything then get the mxr analog chorus instead it has about six knobs i like the ease of use on this one and i omly use chorus sparingly another cool feature of mxr pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it it allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot this is by far the best delay effects box i ve ever used and it has so much potential that it ll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers it s also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end it is built like a tank and doesn t take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very user friendly pedal wish all pedals were built this way highly recommended
574	i was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after i tuned it and began to play my guitar is absolutely beautiful the finish is flawless and it s got that new guitar smell ahhhhhh it does have a pick guard that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog which pleases me it would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick i read one review on a music vendor s website where the reviewer complained about takamine and jasmine printed all over the pick guard and they were right about that but i found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker dah the strings are a little heavier than i like but i ll be changing them in a few weeks anyway the sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything you d expect to pay more for it has a rich full bodied sound i am now a diehard takamine fan i ve been playing mostly acoustics over years i own a d martin epiphone dr zager zad american fender strat gibson studio les paul and have owned many others when my little red traveler showed up at my door i was excited but my expectation bar wasn t set too high i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over wow nicely made neck was perfect just the slightest bow frets were finished better than my gibson when i bought it i found some wet dry sand paper i think grit and spent about minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone wow the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality no buzz perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play the tone is unique not quiet and unless you are expecting martin sound definitely not offensive the sound is kind of acoustic guitar ukulele banjo ish i m thinking with a nice pickup it would make quite nice unique a acoustic lead instrument plays great to the top fret love it unbelievable instrument a pleasure play oh and the case is a freebee buy one be happy one last thing another post mentioned putting your right arm outside the strap and tying between the tuning keys that works well love it i finally found one that supports my strings alvarez jumbo acoustic guitar
575	seriously the shure sm sets the standard which by all other instrument microphones are judged no kidding they work great with guitar for a real acoustic guitar sound drums congas tablas you name it if it s an instrument the sm delivers i hear it s good for vocals as well when the president gives a speech the sm is there in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm the sm is better suited to those who lack vocal projection most wannabe s for instrument sound reinforcement bar none the best how do you review an sm i ve used these most of my life and will continue to very durable i got this to replace the same a year old rusted dented grill i also use a d akg same price and a line wirelesss but the is always reliable first choice or backup what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal right at the upper lip works well for me the bass cut and presence boost are convenient use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids flat s where it s at flat sounds most natural being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might though it takes eq well and you can eq that in if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix so what does it sound like the sound is very natural and true to my voice it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic this thing is heavy and rugged the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one but since my room isn t perfect this will do the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser it really does of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well seriously a db shelf in the highs another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest good microphone for the money sounds a little better than my akg d s knocked it down to stars due to the fact it does not have an on off switch i am a user of behringer products though own of their amps this device works here s what it does you plug an electric bass into the pedal s instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal s high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp you also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the ohm low impedance xlr jack out you can use just the high impedance output or just the xlr output or you can use them both simultaneously when the footswitch is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box when the footswitch is on an led light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on i put footswitch in quotes because i use fingers to push it but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose when you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it some other functional comments about it it runs on volt batteries or a volt power supply i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter battery life isn t super but satisfactory still if using it a lot i suggest using an ac adapter when the battery starts going it sounds awful but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set also when the footswitch is off and the led is not lit this thing functions as a straight xlr ouput direct box for anything you plug into it you could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist the amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass so just use it as a direct box with the tone emulation circuit off for anything except bass the controls are all rotary knobs except the ground lift switch which is a slide switch the controls left to right top row to second row are drive treble bass level presence ground lift slide switch and blend taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed the drive knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness or edge of overdriven tube tone basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose there is no active passive pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want the treble knob is a or db boost and cut of upper frequency tones the bass knob is a or db boost and cut of the lower frequencies o clock is flat or zero db boost or cut on both the treble and bass knobs the level knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration the presence knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone the presence knob isn t a midrange control but does boost the upper mids the ground lift switch only effects the xlr output jack and it should be left off unless you hook it up and there is hum then you can turn the ground lift on and it might help eliminate the hum issue however it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum the blend knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal s output with all the way to the left being none o clock being and all the way clockwise being cons very little bass gear or anything else is perfect these days behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down designed in germany but built in china means you get chinese components and chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing for example at the first battery change the battery clip self destructed as part of the clip s terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip this was a duracell battery the standard for pedal batteries went to radio shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint i ve never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard construction is all plastic the casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes i know not to use my size d foot on it the treble and presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the xlr output for recording or a pa feed basically i set the treble and presence to the point where i hear hiss start then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off the jacks other than the xlr are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal these type jacks are noted for causing problems especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time this unit lacks any dedicated midrange knob but the presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously some people who use this pedal as a stage tool use it as a solo or scoop switch for slap tap solos so the presence bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway pros first and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely this isn t a tech nyc bass driver by any means but works in a similar fashion to one i have a tech bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs the tech sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost i use the behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home if i didn t have the tech unit i might take this unit to gigs but it probably will last way longer the way i keep it setup at home all the time i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal practice type combos many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don t get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp it is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline say anything over about feet for recording the xlr direct out is very useful and the xlr direct out can also be used to feed the pa at a gig if your amp doesn t have a xlr direct out how i use this device i have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the xlr output to connect it to a microphone mixer the output from microphone mixer is patched into a turtle beach santa cruz soundcard in an xp computer i can then record using the computer s recording software practice solo or i can play along to recorded music using headphones with headphones i can play as loud as i want anytime that i want without disturbing anyone most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass so i recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers you can buy better computer speakers that are capable but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable having owned this pedal for about years and knowing what i know about it i would buy it again i would strongly recommend it as a home recording practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong for home use it is fine you can use it at gigs but i d be saving up gig bones to buy something more durable with better performance this is a very versatile tuner i use it all the time to check my instruments and keep things sounding good highly recommend this product ukulele straps are a rare thing and i ve yet to find the perfect one this one gets close not all uke players use straps some do and some don t purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced however i have two acoustic electric ukes and they are heavier than the non electrified ones the purists use i ve found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing a preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar this neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less there is another device called a uke leash that also works well it ties onto the headstock i like this neotech better because even though the instrument isn t balanced perfectly it is balanced better than with the uke leash the uke leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the neotech simple sling this neotech simple sling soundhole clip strap works on my concert and tenor ukes equally well but i have to adjust it some when switching it between the two the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument i don t know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments you have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument the clip on the neotech sling is wider than most i ve seen and this extra width reduces but does not completely eliminate that risk the wider clip spreads the stress out i ve seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and i m afraid to try them on a ukulele i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it the uke leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place so i like this neotech soundhole clip device better the only thing i don t like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap but once on it is great you look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can t do it with a hat on it gets easier the more you do it i d buy the neotech simple sling again i recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don t want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
576	i m sure glad that i bought these straps there not leather but are put together very well i plan on using them as backups in the studio the price was just right cam quickly and i d buy them again what makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently if you have a standard size guitar neck don t bother with that i would have preferred something that was stationary that i could just stick the guitar in as it is i have to jiggle and align it a bit using hands sometimes which will be annoying after awhile if i buy another it would be a standard hanger i was looking for a decent capo found this and have been using for months without a problem cheap and works great would recommend to any guitarist
577	a guitar player can never have enough of these things around these picks hold up well that says alot because i am not easy on picks if any kind clean and clear sound great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking i prefer a string with a little more volume they tune well and hold a tune well i know most budget guitars don t come with cases most not even a gig bag anymore that s the trade off i guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down even my fender standard telecaster came sans case and i had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gig bag as an incentive but even that was back in the day i had not looked at guitar gear in so long that i didn t think about guitar cases until i got the itch to get a new six string and came across these they look great seem well built i am not a professional touring musician and apparently do the job the exterior is covered in black tolex just like a pricey case and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price the storage compartment is adequately sized and there s a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched there are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case it fits both my mim tele andsquier by fender deluxe stratocaster maple neck pearl white metallicperfectly and i suspect it will do a fine job protecting them i will be picking up a tweed version for the telecaster to match up with the style and my lovely fender amp like i stated there s no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case not much to say about a guitar strap except i had planned to use it on a simga acoustic without a pin at the neck i ended up using the strap on my strat for the acoustic and this one is on the strat this one doesn t come with a wrap or tie for the nut so it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body if you need to secure one end at the headstock this is not an option it is comfortable though
578	can t play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of peg drops though i don t know why they don t put guitar type turners on violins cellos and bases this shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle no adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument s size or arrived set for it simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back and the rubber feet keep it in place good value for the price great little tuner easy to work with and also easy to find the price is also right and i recommend this little snark is easy to carry around and works great i have used several different styles and brands this is a must have for musicians
579	i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d distortion effects pedal works great and gives me that mind blowing distortion you would only expect from a more expensive unit the only reason i didn t give it stars is it tends to be a little noisey if you turn the gain up too much you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar he swears by them and loves how they stay in his grip without slipping while picking and going nutso on his guitars buy them you won t be sorry plus wow its a great price the snark sn is small accurate and easy to use i have a more sophisticated tuner and the snark works faster and is much easier to use
580	i love these strings and the price too since i like to change them every time i do a modification to my guitars every couple months i change something making upgrades they sound great and stay in tune well these cables are very high quality they feel hefty and durable i wish i d gotten one longer than feet though since i can only play close to my amp with two five footers oh well i bought this during the black friday sale the price was right since if i was dissatisfied then i wouldn t be out that much money quality product well worth the purchase i would recommend this this was the easiest tuner i had i am sorry i gave it away now when i upgraded lol this a solid performing unit at this price point i ve been using this alongside my laptop for as long as i remember and it works the same as the day i bought it the two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to use my only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap but this is still a great usb interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than a very nice pick both in feel and texture the design is a bit boring though only complaint is that it s fairly small about the size of a canadian or us five cent piece where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger about the size of a cent piece but that s okay i got this the same time as i got a set of dava jazz grip red picks and the dunlop max grip jazz iii carbon fiber guitar picks and i think i like the dava picks the best all three are tight grip picks and all the same size they re all good though i d rate this one next best and the jazz iii carbon fiber next after that i bought this cable in an emergency situation one where i was on the road needed a great cable and didn t have access to roll my own using what would ve been essentially the same parts i exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio and in critical places of my live setup the cable itself is top shelf quiet and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect as an instrument cable this could possibly be a little short if you move around a bunch making it worth it to go for the cable as a bass or guitar player if you don t like being tied down i used this as part of a keyboard rig where it was perfect on all levels quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum the highs were crystal the bass clear connection is solid i am not a gold fanatic but these are excellent great warranty and a reputation that holds value these are real deal pro cables as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price but not necessarily a superior build or sound which is why i didn t walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster s and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead
581	second one i bought lousy build quality and only lasted months went through two of these before i learned my lesson don t waste your money on this junk i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk according to the ad copy this pedal replicates full stack marshall crunch as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that what i m loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up its responsive to your picking attack its distortion is very very harmonically rich and it does give you a marshall type sound good boost in the mids and bass giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for sad to say it actually does the full stack thing better than my proco rat which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal the rat is fantastic and i have no plans to sell mine don t get me wrong but the crunch distortion can get the raging full stack tones the rat can but has a tighter bottom end less noise and a more open sound than the rat individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion its a great pedal period its a darn guitar miracle at as a side point i play lots of ramones stuff and this pedal more than any other gives me that awesome johnny ramone tone i was running my gold top with p s into this pedal then into the sparkling clean twin reverb setting on my fender mustang ii this pedal plays well with modeling amps which is a rarity let me tell you and with some tweaking i was getting a fantastic ramones tone better than i ve ever got with my rat my boss ds ds hm anything else i ve owned and i ve owned over dozen other dirt boxes over the years this is the pedal that finally did it it just nails that cranked s marshall stack sound my hat s off to joyo they made a fantastic distortion one of the very best i ve ever played and they re practically giving it away buy one you ll use it you ll love it you ll be happy you bought it this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used for direct recording it does if used with an amp maybe but however you use it it is sweet reading the product description may give you an idea about this product i received plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion it s solid well made and looks feels like it can handle the world tour get it this is very simple to use and it records for minutes so that is awesome the playback sound is very good quality
582	this is the mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects can t believe it took me so long to get one of those using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet it is holding a shure sm microphone the microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic but i m using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads idiot proof compact extremely sturdy all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts runs on aa batteries features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperpyle pro pct are test tone function which sends a known volume signal down the line very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment intermittent issue indication this is what made me choose this model if there s even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot my only complaints the a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife quite frustrating used my dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw and managed to get it out there s an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous luckily i have no need for the clip i used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw no rubber feet on the bottom metal enclosure battery cover screw sliding around and marring whatever it sits on i stuck some re purposed rubber feet on the bottom after the few problem solving situations mentioned above this thing is a star product too bad they couldn t go the extra step to make it star out of the box xlr cables are hard to mess up these are great they do the trick why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap i tried this in front in the middle and at the end of an effects chain as well as by itself plugged into the effects loop of my mesa boogie mark v amplifier whenever it is in the path as soon as i engage my effects loop the signal level drops considerably it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not the chorus effect is good but i don t want my volume to drop every time i turn on my effects loop i have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that i use so i can t raise the send any more
583	the planet waves classic series ft instrument cable is basic but works great and is very flexible seems sturdy enough to last a long time i have many planet waves cables they are all very well made i like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts an excellent value i would highly recommend i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x champ it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender it sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings great replacement and a definite upgrade makes the champ a super champ works great with my fender super camp x easy connection easy activation of switches immediate response small light and compact great product i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised the sound is very authentic as i have a s tube champ in excellent working order for reference as well as a deville this little amp has the classic fender tube sound with a broad punchy tone and the right amount of compression the included digital effects vibraphone delay reverb chorus and tremolo are all convincing and well executed the modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ tweed deluxe clean dirty baseman princeton clean dirty deluxe clean dirty twin and an array of british and metal amps all and all a super practice amp or mic able performance amp great job fender ps i don t review products that don t stand out as excellent
584	my first guitar ever i am happy with it i read great reviews here and the price seemed good it is a slightly darker color than the picture as others have mentioned and the top part isn t pink like the pic also as others have mentioned it still looks pretty i did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones to minimize finger pain i ordered d addario ej d phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings extra light in a package of three sets and i like those strings better the color is nicer though the originals weren t rusty they looked new others have said their strings were rusty but mine weren t but most importantly it s easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter thinner strings i might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part i am a female and it s already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a man s especially bar chords but for now this is fine i also ordered dava grip tip guitar picks they are nice and i got a kyser string capo in gold and that works well and i got a planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system add on for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck the strap i got was a levy s with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable and i got a planet waves pro winder string winder cutter which came in handy for re stringing and i bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which i haven t tried yet and i keep the guitar sitting on an on stage xcg guitar stand and i got a string cleaner by fender so i write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar i ll be using mine to sing with so that s why i needed a capo cause many songs i sing need a capo i use a lot of youtube tutorials to learn how to play and also find tabs chords on ultimate guitar website i can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband a music recording program that comes on mac computers and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful i am very satisfied with my purchase it came in a big rectangular box and inside that box was another one that looked like a coffin haha it made me laugh and inside that was my lovely new guitar this is a solid little usb interface there are no frills and there s no latency i have used this for years without any problems and it s very portable i run this between my small channel mixer and my laptop for recording guitar and it s well worth the price to have one of these around can also be used with tape players to import audio into your computer i use this for more than just guitar recording this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar i use this to play in the church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold i was happy excellent equipment for the price i paid can t beat what i got have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them it s been several years now and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment awesome product works great it even lets you set your level recording options for low or high level or between settings it has lots of cool features listed in the manual are clearly defined how to use in manual short version it s awesome after online research i decided to buy and found locally this midi pad to use in reason although not confirmed online as working with reason i was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems my cpu is windows but it worked on my msi netbook also this unit also worked in ableton live as stated online i would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs i just got the rd monitor great price got here in days so my first units have a very bright blue ish color led for power the latest one has a very mellow amber color led anyone else noticed different color led s comparing the units the newest one seems to have a differnt type feel on the impact plasctic shell weight and sound is the same i use them for everything from full band to acoustic great for vocals and guitar as stated by others not much bass response but from a in speaker what would you expect mine have been dropped wet hot and never missed a beat
585	use it every time i restring my guitar works really good i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary nice little kit it has grit sandpaper in it i hadn t noticed that in the listing maybe i overlooked it i had just bought some grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade the made it glassy smooth again wet sanding i used this instead of the that came with the package and it worked well for me i had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board big mistake it deadened the sound terrible i was miserable my guitar sounded like s after minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and bob s your uncle good as new i m going to use this everytime i change strings on all my guitars nice little kit i might even get around to using the grit paper that came with it one of these days works a charm on acoustic guitars haven t tried it on the electric guitars yet bought as a gift for my son and he s very pleased with it what can you say it s a guitar strap it does the job and looks good and for a levy s leather strap is a good deal i got the gold and it s good looking without being garish ive been using this item for about weeks now and i love it i have a homemade pedalboard the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board i power pedals and absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up if anything it sounds better than a battery for sure for the price of these i am very happy with the purchase i feel it sounds really good and has many settings i think the build on these are fine for daily use don t expect it to break anytime soon anyway i ve heard about the snark tuners before and have seen them once in awhile but while skimming the music side of amazon i finally picked this up and it works great
586	i have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it boy was i surprised this case is awesome great quality fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great definetly reccomend this case this is a nice addition to a guitar that you don t want to drill a hole into for a strap button it s a quick release with the buckle one end stays on the strap the other around the head stock of the guitar makes it nice if you have more than one guitar without a strap button buy i was a little unsure when i was unpacking this stand as the actual rack swings side to side when i put my guitar on it it was fine it held perfectly this cradles my guitar nicely i just wish that it was like the one in the picture and was straight it actually reclines back fairly far well father than it looks like it would in the pics i will recommend this to anybody in my life who ends up needing a guitar rack in the future i have bought of these now for me and a few friends and they work great i am sure they will wear out in time so i have a couple extras but you can t beat them i was using a nylon strap before i got this one i love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap the leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and i don t have that worry of it coming loose
587	i ve had this strap for at least a year now and it still works so well goes great with my guitar too it is not the size for mini guitar may be for the big one connections are shaky you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low i got this guitar for my year old son he loves it this is a buitifull clasic guitar with a good clear sound when he is not messing with the knobs i would definatly purchase this again these cables are just what i hoped they would be they work well on my electric and my acoustic happy guy here thanks sounds disgusting very bright and clear highs nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows don t hope to take chords on it only on first strings may be try out fender s mini amp if you re searching for a little thing or but a bigger one
588	i bought this for a friend who plays the guitar he said that you can hear the guitar but barely pack of guitar picks check meet the beatles theme checkretail packaging checktwo day delivery got it the next day thanks to prime checkhappy guitarist checki can t really complain about anything except maybe for the price but then again i didn t have to buy these they are fun and kitschy stars i was very pleased when i got my beatles tin and collector picks the service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable i was surprised at how cool both the tin and the picks were they are a real talking point and a must have for muso s who like individual items in their collection thanks again cheers i recently purchased a vox mini g modeling amp to go with my new mainland tenor acoustic electric ukulele it was my first electric instrument and i immediately fell in love with the combination uke amp a little time went by and i began wishing i could plug my other non electric ukuleles and guitars into my amp i see diy pickup sets are pretty inexpensive but i didn t really want the expense times eight or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments then i stumbled on this cherub pickup for about the cost of lunch at mcdonalds it seemed i might electrify on the fly whatever instrument i cared to pickup so i bought it bottom line is that it works very well for my needs and although i don t have a very critical ear i think i can hear a slight quality clarity difference between the built in pickup on my mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments but that s not a surprise and such a small difference that i don t much care so far i ve been clipping it into the sound holes but i might try it on the headstock as others have recommended if you re a rock god don t even consider this why would you anyway but if you re a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while this cherub is for you i couldn t say that i loved it it s only a guitar hanger it just holds a guitar if i needed another i would buy this type got it for bucks and wish i d bought about more just as good as anything else out there onlky complant is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as i d like but that s my take on it buy if you need a stand for the money you won t be disappointed
589	i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster works great i didn t notice any change in tone it just worked like the old one but the main this is that it worked and my tele sounds as great as it always did got this for an sg style guitar and it fits with plenty of room this is a better quality bag than an average bag but with a couple of comments it smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening the large main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip surprised me because it s a large toothed zipper construction seems to be pretty good this is not a hard case but to get a guitar from point a to b it works just fine padding is sufficiently thick it s not a paper thin bag but it s not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop would i get another one probably as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances otherwise i d get a soft sided hard case the new wave of styrofoam cases or a regular old hard sided case i love my laptop a thinkpad t it does almost everything i need almost a mono mic jack no other inputs the behringer u control gives me stereo now the behringer reputation pulls through once again i ve tried some usb sound cards without success this product puts my older laptop besides newer ones well done behringer these are perfect for those using dunlop strap locks but have more guitars than straps these are allparts parts quick usps shipping a great idea but pure crap in terms of functionality if you don t have something heavy on the flat end the rubber piece moves and before you know it your axe is on the ground i saw some pictures of putting a ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight but i m not so hot with that idea especially if the can is open the lip need to extend down longer and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around if i had a permanent place to mount this i d gorilla glue it down but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i ll get an extra guitar stand instead good idea but it doesn t work
590	i ve been using the same straploks on all my guitars for the past years i have not had one fail on me ever just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it s on right i ve struggled with the c clip in the past but what are you going to do it s a one time thing when you first install so it s no biggie this product is great i use it after every session keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board every guitar player should keep this in their case what s most impressive isn t the top drawer leather and craftsmanship that goes without saying from levy s it s the clever design the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap adjusts to almost any position and adjusts to almost any small wireless transmitter transmitter not receiver this is the most i ve ever spent on a guitar strap but i have to say it s well worth the price very comfortable and looks great too for many years i ve been playing with proel and fender cables until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components best of all warranty for life or maybe longer had for over a year hasn t failed bedroom vox amp never leaves the house never turned up above conversational volume level so i can t elaborate on sound can only comment on reliability for my usage it s fairly tough but flexible no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidly mounted i would definitely buy this brand again i just bought a rickenbacker that came with schaller strap locks pre installed i ve used dunlops before but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass so i just bought the schaller buttons i don t quite like their look as well as the large round dunlops but there s no question about the quality these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon
591	i was buying a pawn shop guitar when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar i didn t expect to actually use it but what the heck i could sell it and make a bit of money back got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the frontman just to see if it worked i was surprised to find out not only did it work it sounded very good i own a deluxe reverb all tube amp and the little frontman had the fender sound what really was impressive was the reverb it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound i actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well i normally use a blues jr for small gigs but the frontman did a fine job on some smaller gigs when all i need is a little reverb i just plug straight into the amp and it worked well plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it s small and easy on the back all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it i would easily pay full retail it is a nice little amp might even see if i can squeeze a inch speaker into it i bough this amp for my year old son who is learning guitar for his christmas present i thought that since i love fender guitars and since he has a mini squier we d like to get something in the fender family i seriously expected a cheap imitation of a line spider with a fender logo slapped on it i should have had more faith in fender i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp the amp models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool i have ever used the amps don t sound digital or processed they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain you would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it i can t get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe they sound so full and strong my biggest compliment of the mustang is that it is the only modeling amp that has great sounding vintage tones line has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones vox has never really made great modeling stuff digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc this amp is for you there is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for modern metal but metalheads might be better off with the line stuff the other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls by looking at the controls you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound you don t need to dive levels deep into an lcd screen in order to make great sounding tweaks but if you like to go deep you ll love the fender fuse software it is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound the fact that fender not only included fuse with this amp but also the ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything is just frosting on the cake i am a father of who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing with the added features of a headphone jack and an aux in i can play whenever i want i am actually selling my nice tube amp and using the mustang as my only amp for now and i feel like i am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all the value of this amp is amazing people will shell out x as much for a line modeler but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the fender tones i ordered this epi jr because i had one years ago my son adopted for his own and missed having one saw this in tv yellow and had to have it i came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website it was set up very well among the few guitars i have purchased that were playable out of the box fret work is top notch finish is good some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you ll add some of your own there was a slight binding in the nut most people think it s the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up if you can t make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue the only thing i did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream plugged in it sounds good you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region this guitar will make you a more versatile player the absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out sustain is very good as a result i could carry on forever but you get the idea i ve been a player for years and a collector for half of that i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch i have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports the quality is superb on the most recent ones tone snobs may laugh but my new epi les paul jr plays just as well as most anything out there
592	i bought this strap for a esp ec les paul style guitar i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price when i got the strap i was impressed the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar the back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they don t harm the finish on your guitar locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open it s not going to unlock on you strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable i m not a performing musician so i actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand holds everything from a mm nylon pick to a mm rubber pick and i have yet to see one fall out simple solution to a simple problem i have several of these straps in different colors and i ve never been disappointed it holds my pound les paul with no problems and the first one i bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong if you like the design go for it i ve probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life and find that planet waves makes a good one at a fair price picks will always be a subjective thing every user has his her own preference so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end these are well made last quite awhile and they don t even look bad try them out you might just like them
593	wow something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit i ve had behringer mikes before and currently have a couple of xm s which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm s i saw this three pack of s for in a hard case and couldn t believe it i hooked them up right beside the s and while there is a little difference it s not much the has a little more high end but it s easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass the presence is also boosted a little on the meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback for now i m using the matched s as the main mikes for our vocalists and keeping the older s as backups i bought the of these for less than the price of one sm although the shure and the b is better the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for i can afford to buy another pack for complete backup a wise choice for the budget conscious this is an interesting limited effect pedal i bought it mainly to use with my non pedal steel guitar on a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells however i play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals this pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound it s sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings no chording this pedal works along with that technique i combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes i tried this with regular guitar but it s not the same for chords it does add an effect but it s not very distinctive and for single notes it would depend on the song i haven t really found many instances where it s useful there either as i normally don t want volume swells for solos on guitar but on steel guitar it works very well this is one of many behringer pedals that offer a unique stand alone sound the chorus effects are well known and even included on many amps and featured on almost every multi effects pedal i like the individual pedals because i can add in just what i want instead of relying on someone else s idea in a pre set this chorus is just about right it has a range of sounds for different situations and is very reliable and well made there is no problem with the b tough plastic cases if you want a metal housing it s for some sentimental reason thinking that metal is automatically better or more durable than plastic you just need to push the off on switch not bat baseballs i had the behringer dr ultra reverb but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds although this unit is only more the difference in sound and tone may as well be difference in quality of sound that is this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences it may not have every reverb sound but it has a nice selection and they cover an impressive range as well as giving you the option of wet full or dry tinny sounds and a trails that essentially adds some sustain there s also an echo setting but it s not very pronounced though it does add an echo like sound so my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualities there are a couple of annoying inconveniences one is the bright blue light indicating on this has been commented on before i have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined when it s on you can t read the dials because of the glare in your eyes i did find a solution i put dark nail polish over the led bulb i had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming i desired the second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color this is impossible to read in stage or even dim room lighting of course you can remember where it is or which one it is but my other behringer pedals all have white lettering making them much easier to read every b pedal has its own distinctive color so that helps my solution to this little dilemma was to buy some white vinyl letters from office depot and put them over the words reverb on the pedal it was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes but now i m much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations this pedal does add reverb and it is adjustable to different effects but the range of effects is not great and the difference in them is often not very pronounced it s kind of an empty sounding reverb as opposed to more lush effects the reverb machine rv also from behringer and for only more is a far superior machine with more effects and better tone though it has a couple of other minor drawbacks see my review of that item for clarification i have several behringer pedals all placed in a behringer pedal board most of the b pedals work quite well i have no quality issues with them some people complain about the plastic cases but they are tough and reliable unless you re in the habit of abusing your pedals by smashing them around or can t control your stomp pressure some are better than others and this one works perfectly i have b pedals one of them is a tuner and each seems to add some noise to the amp output especially when it is in quiescent mode no signal input this pedal placed at the end of the line just before the signal goes into the amp quiets all that noise that the other pedals generate i had to check this because i at first thought my amp was making the noise but when i bypassed all the pedals my amp was quiet which was a relief then i needed relief from the pedal noise and this did the trick the controls are a little misleading but easy to get used to and adjust the send receive function is for quieting the noise you send to an additional effects pedal which seems pointless as the best way to use this is to put it at the end of the chain to quiet all the effects the mute function may help but when i turn on my pedal tuner this also functions as a mute i had to do a little modification of the b pedal board to make this fit in as i already had pedals in place but with the removal of a couple of screws it fit into a slot meant for a longer pedal i don t actually need the on off function on this most of the time so placing it in that sideways out of the way spot was no disadvantage i just leave it on all the time so it always quiets the noise when i m not actually playing however i can still operate it if necessary for example for the mute function if i needed that it s aggravating to have to have a pedal to eliminate noise from other pedals but at least there is an easy solution in a noise gate like this one i ve read its not really complete isolated but it does the job i didn t realise how much noise my one spot was adding i a b them both one after the other and it truly was quieter the only problem i have is my tc helicon takes volts input but ma this pedal only supplies ma so the pedal didn t work in the volt slit luckily however it does work plugged into the volt ma spot so im using it there everything else in the other volt ma slots it s a lot quieter now i recommend trying it and saving some cash simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively good value low to the ground so balance is not an issue
594	i had for years been using elixir strings on mywashburn d simply because i was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch i m glad i tried out these d addario strings these strings are an excellent complement to my washburn which has mellowed out over the years they are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the elixir strings i can t speak to the manufacturers claim of times more life but as of now i d have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money highly recommended i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer rhythm and lead styles both sound great definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future this was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings he found just what he needed and at a great price this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better i can play for hours and my shoulders feel fine i feed the narrow end through of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good well made feels very strong texture is very nice doesnt slip overall a very good product i ordered two sets so that i could set everything up in nice orderly progression on my stomp box heard no evidence of hum and they seem to work just fine keeping everything in order by the way these are listed as feet but actually are wish i had measured as i ordered a long cords thinking they would be twice as long oooops my bad when i discovered they were only longer i ll be upfront and honest right away and say that i m not the biggest fan of headstock tuners i love the idea but usually i feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired but when this popped up on my vine newsletter i thought i d give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things i don t like about the other ones cough snark cough a little background first i guess i ve been playing guitar for the last years and i currently have two other tuners i have a little korg plug in type where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up i also have a boss tu pedal tuner if i m jamming with friends or playing a show the tu is what i ll use to stay in tune its very durable and accurate and i like how i can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal so i can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and or the audience for home practice i use the korg as i usually tune up before i start playing then just plug into my practice amp and blast away the korg is nice and accurate easy enough to use for alternate tunings and in years of having it around including in and out of jam sessions before buying the tu i ve only had to buy one replacement i first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue snark that everyone seems to have these days he was not incredibly pleased with it not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn t exatly easy to tune up with it while i thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something i d want on my headstock enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves does it fix the problems that made the snark so unappealing to my friend and me accuracy it does seem to tune accurately that s a good thing and it already puts this ahead of the snark its not easy to use for alternate tunings however so do keep that in mind also the letters take some getting used to as they use that kind of chunky lcd block style that you find on some dvd players not a huge complaint but it isn t as idiot proof as my korg or tu looks ease of use it s quite a bit more subtle than the snark able to hide behind your headstock which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar the only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a les paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen my lp copy has the larger grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock i wear my guitar fairly low so i was able find an area where i can see it from the top down but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck those with fender style headstocks should have no problem though it ll work great for them also it is plenty bright so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue durability this is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are the snark is very easy to break as it rests on a small ball joint this planet waves mini isn t going to lose its head too easy but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and i don t expect it to hold up under too much use the tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session i still think it would be easy enough to break i haven t had it long enough for this to happen yet so i can only give you my initial impressions let s just say this i d never gig with this guy as my only tuner its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark however headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they re gonna work for everyone anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner i personally suggest a boss tu or tu or a korg pitchblack i know they re more expensive but you ll be happier off in the long run those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session this is a nice option but it may not hold up forever i ll probably stick to my tu and my korg plug in but as headstock tuners go this is nicer than most
595	the gain on this mic isn t the greatest but for speeches and soft recordings this guy can handle it all very well great guitar companies don t always make or sell under their aegis the best strings i love my teles but i can t stand fender strings likewise i love my martin ukulele but trying these strings for the second time i had the same conclusion as i did the first aquila s are far better aquila s have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound the martins begin to hold their tune sooner aquila s take a couple of days or more but the sound is thinner and the feel isn t nearly as friendly the approximately dollar price difference is not for me worth the lesser satisfaction even on my least expensive ukes considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings the higher priced aquila s still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks use the martin s or any cheaper string when you are working on your uke put the stress of repeatedly de tuning and re tuning on them then switch to aquila s for playing some may like the martins but few won t love the aquila s i gave this stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating i have nothing to say against the product or the company only that this is not a guitar case it is a mandolin case amazon should correct this stagg stb w acoustic guitar bagepiphone case for epiphone dot sheraton i just got these to collect not to use to play with they look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff i bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin they had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback well surprise surprise surprise it didn t feedback and it sounds great i would recommend this product
596	not happy with the sellers description or the product the description says heavy duty which makes you assume that it s a regular hard plastic mic clip but it s not it s rubber it sucks used it a couple times and it s hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it s probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly and flex it s flexible who uses flexible mic clips make sure you don t buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead i just finished installing of these and couldn t be any happier with the product it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation i didn t think this was possible but i actually found a product made in the usa i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows i did not have the mis matching color issue that others commented on all i did was contact the seller in my case brook mays music and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all are going on the same wall they were extrememly responsive even sending two emails concerning my request basically saying they would do their best but no promises well brook mays came through for me i received very quickly i might add of these that matched perfectly i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site whatever good things you ve heard about the at is probably true well unless if you ve heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky but it sounds great when your recording songs haha i record with fl studio and it s even great so far i recommend you get this this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect this saved med at least instead of getting a traditional pre amp best invention ever also portable downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but i keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff i m surprised that the maker of amazon s popular at would go this low the mic imo is fully valued even at its single digit price it s dynamic rather than condenser but it still requires loads of power to get it up to workable levels phantom power which is a requirement for condenser mics would probably not add sufficient heft it s very lightweight and with its optional plug and on off switch is versatile enough the quality of the sound moreover isn t bad providing you can hear it be prepared to have plenty of watts on hand to coax any appreciable sensitivity from this non responsive creature i haven t tested it for recording purposes despite appearances this mic is no bargain
597	if you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano it may appear little awkward amazingly sturdy for the it isn t as sturdy as some but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands it folds up very nicely i d buy it again it isn t top of the line but it gets the job done i wouldn t abuse of the chair too much though the material looks a little floosy the music stand is similar to the stands used in schools this stand is durable firm and easy to assemble i bought three of these at the same time to replace some older straps that were starting to rip and fall apart they are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons two out of the three i bought are still performing well but one of them quickly cracked around the hole where that the strap button goes through and will occasionally slip off not a huge deal because that seems to happen with almost every guitar strap i ve ever bought a one point or another but it happened quicker with this particular strap i suppose unless i have strap locks there is no way around this
598	this has become my number one cable for my carvin bass i gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid i only use something different if i need a longer reach and i love the tweed cover very satisfied with this one as a kid i learned to play the trombone proficiently but my heart wasn t really in it so i took up the guitar which i love i played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time i recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock i have an old ibanez and a les paul custom and have tried several picks in that quest there are several i have liked and several that i haven t but thus far my favorite is the mm tortex blue picks they have a very nice almost powdery matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don t break though the s are fairly stiff depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences i won t say that i will never try anything else but thus far i find myself picking up my tortex more than other picks i like this pick the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers its not soft or to hard of a pick i like it
599	so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors bass sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great i use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom h this adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events i own several of these and love them i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional also check out hosa s sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter first off the shipping was fantastic it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition it is an extremely well made and solid product i think a few people have given this les paul a rep of just being a starter guitar trust me when i say i have no problem leaving my les paul standard at home and taking this one to a gig it plays well and the sound incredible it even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp i can t say enough good things about this guitar it s that good if you re thinking aout buying this guitar don t just buy it buy it this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp seems well built and rugged although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace this is definitely a high quality cable however my experience with this model and the less expensivemonster standard instrument cable ft straight plugs s i model has shown me that the only difference is one is prettier with its gold colored bling fittings sonically i found them to be the same or to my ears anyway as you can see by the tag above this review amazon has verified that i purchased this cable as well as amazon verifying my purchase of the less pricey model on my review on that product page i initially purchased a pair of these cables for my keyboards because i had invested a significant sum into those instruments and wanted nothing but the best cables i purchased the standard cables for some low end instruments including an old squier jazz bass and a new but very inexpensiveepiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar vintage sunburst neither of which to my mind warranted top of the line cables much to my surprise when i started testing each cable on each instrument all through the same amp to keep things equal i could not discern any sonic difference between both monster cable models same manufacturer but different models to be sure this more expensive model looked cooler but when it came to sound no discernible difference that i could detect anyway more perplexing is the molded stress relief ends on the less expensive model seem to make that one more reliable my recommendation is test both this one and the standard model side by side before plunking down extra money for no added value beyond looks which i have to admit may be a selling point on stage for some folks no shame as long as you know what you are paying extra for and why i m used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck occassionally there are problems with this set up then i saw these no more bendable problems i really love these extensions this is nearly identical to theguardian cases cg b bass guitar caseat about half the cost however there are some issues with this case as well as limitations first the issues while the covering appears to be stitched on it is for the most part glued on and if the case is left in a hot unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges on the other hand someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car or garage or other storage space for prolonged periods however you should be aware of the issue if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers imagine the effect on your bass the limitations are simple the case while a hard shell design is not as strong as one made from abs plastic the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides this is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs but if you have a heavy road schedule and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band s gear this case will not afford you the protection of an ata style case also note that i have only used this case for a fender jazz bass so any long scale j or p style basses will fit i cannot be sure about other brands and models i mentioned an ata style case as a better solution and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules for less demanding protection i recommend that you also consider this case which i purchased as an upgrade when i became aware of the issues and limitations of the musician s gear model skb electric bass rectangular hardshell standard latches handle if you still opt for the musician s gear case you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag i ve used so many guitar cables over the years that i lost count it s hard to find a tough low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere but this one is the best one out there for the price paid its made well with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that i love i use it for all of my equipment connections and it simply works with no problems and no noise that i could detect try it out you ll discover the same as me and my band mate s have that this is the best cable for the money on amazon so stiff nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle if you sing and use effects pedals for an instrument and can t rely on a good boom microphone stand being at every venue get one of these and throw it in with your gear worked perfectly to use my samson mic with a stand i purchased definitely would purchase again solid quality build good purchase nice microphone stand for the cost sturdy adjustable good construction it works we like it will purchase an extender to use with it works great very good feel we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetmy wife loves it if i needed two i would buy another this stand is great for my lb peavey it is a light weight rack and i had to put the amp toward the bottom i wouldn t put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily haven t tried gigging with it but if you are gentle i think it would work fine one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs they can be configured as a master slave set up with a single link cable a inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per cm in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient the low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ i have run both aroland rd nx digital pianoandroland v combo vr the grand piano setting on the rd nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the b emulation from the v combo i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand s down bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances i use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you however once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument s volume and eq controls there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand first the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm to the floor not exceed inches i agree this may be relatively small but it s heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high it s easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended for me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great value it s the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages however it s the attention to small construction details that i love the xlr ends are quality components but cheap ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly another factor is the strain reliefs at each end those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them of course the color coding is a godsend i can now tell at a glance what is connected to what both live and in my home studio i have not experienced any extraneous noise using these but i am careful to eliminate sources or route around them still these are as good as any other cables i have purchased i ll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision i was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk not the case i can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for i am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables i have used them with my bands pa system and they work nicely i would and do recommend them to anyone looking for quality at an affordable price if you are have problems knowing what and where your systems are terminating theses are a must for you i have mastched them with my microphones and it is easy for controlling and identifying a bit heavy and doesn t fold up to be very compact but its not like there are any better options out there so would love an aluminum one that could fold up real compact but this is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest the height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle the seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne i apologize but that is my best reference for comparison assembling is simple and fast i had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances i managed to get it done with no problems another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists the foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals however this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture i used this with drums but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bit the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport it s not a deal breaker on the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience i purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason i useon stage ss b tripod speaker stands which are light duty but awkward to carry this case solves that problem when i mentioned light duty in the title i truly meant it while i gig twenty times per month nearly all are totally acoustic with a small powered speaker for rooms where the pianist vocalist has to project over a grand piano on very rare occasions do we need a full pa and that is where this case comes in handy moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward transporting them in this case isn t these hold up beautifully if used three or four times per month when a full pa is needed i am not sure i would want them for the heavier all metal speaker stands because the weight would quickly wear the case out it has reinforced stress points but i still feel those are not adequate for heavier stands you can easily fit the two stands that i mentioned above and aon stage stands ms tripod boom microphone stand the side pocket is good for incidentals like xlr to inch adapters patch cables and the like bottom line this case is for occasional use only and even then for lighter stands i awarded it five stars because it does exactly what i need and is not touted to be anything but a light weight case first i bought a fm dsp on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store that was my mistake i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks well here it is friends in all it s glory tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price it s loud it s clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it add a danelectro distortion pedal of some sort off amazon for distortion and you re home i own nine amps including fender crate and peavey tube models and this is cleaner if you play c w look no further if you fingerpick this is your amp electrified banjo mandolin or violin this is the amp but if you follow the darker side keep looking i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly what i love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path and have some nice touches in the way they are made one of those nice touches is a strain relief at both ends which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can and will introduce noise and static eventually the plugs are also of the highest quality they mate perfectly with receptacles on guitars and amps i mentioned that these are for inside playing what i mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface that is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is made otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance get one as a spare if for no other reason because i think you will be pleased with it the zt lunchbox is some sort of new technology that allows loud and good sounding tone to come through a box the literal size of a lunchbox i was amazed at how small the amp was when i first purchased it tiny then i was amazed at how loud it could be and still have clean headroom others have reviewed and written about a hissing sound but i have not had a problem with that after trying it with guitars passive p u s active p u s and acoustic electric it remains nice and quiet i have been using it as a practice amp as well as in a band setting now here s the thing it does not have a lot of bass frequency to it but i noticed that setting it on the floor does help some but still not enough if you re looking for that heavy metal scooped sound so i would not recommend it for you metal heads out there however for all you jazzers and rockers the tone knob makes a big difference i keep my tone at about a o clock setting because i prefer a little darker sound and it has enough mids to cut through the mix nicely still bottom line i would recommend this amp obviously i gave it stars i don t think you will be dissappointed i purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive epiphone les paul jr which fits perfectly as does a squier strat on the plus side the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some but not a lot of abuse the reason i claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear that should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this one other issue i ve had with the case is i left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges especially the lip around the top of the case again this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot enclosed space for prolonged periods for inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument it is perfect for occasional gigging but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road i would not hesitate to purchase another one if i acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because i do like the better protection this particular case provides the hanger was very easy to install holds my acoustics safely the instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hanger the product arrived within days i couldn t believe how fast it got here and yet the price is the best part of all super sturdy well built what more can i say it s a sheet stand
600	i ve used the tortex picks for a while now and have been really happy with them this pick however takes it to the next level very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick i use the for acoustic and the same holds true great product perfect perfect size weight shape i like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds recommended the main reason i bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics is because i had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop a that is a must i have to say that after owning it for a while i must agree i ve used other tuners when i happened to not bring this one along and thats been my experience also its easy to read which note you re on when you re on a dimly lit stage i love the performances and sound production quality of celebration day the band s on fire and jason bonham did a incredible job a must buy for the zep fan i can highly recommend this to rehearse that long for this one show it s a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts with jason doing so well it was possible i could easily imagine ny sf rio paris rom tokyo etc
601	for the price of this winder cutter its awesome if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect a guitar player can never have enough of these things around these picks hold up well that says alot because i am not easy on picks if any kind my strat has bigger frets than any guitar i have ever owned and i have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges particularly on the rd string this to set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure while still feeling faster than an acoustic guitar they sound great last a long time stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets i maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since i no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy got this for my electric guitar does its job just fine and the white tips look quite nice a truly great product
602	this stand works fine if you don t need a shock mount the base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations i ran into trouble when trying to mount a r de nt a mic on a shock mount the low height which would otherwise help stabilize the mic left too little clearance between the mic and desktop if you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic you re better off buying the slightly more expensiveon stage ds b adjustable desk microphone stand black btw my copy of this stand also did not have the inch male thread this gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the more me setting it s simple easy to use works great seriously just stop don t be like me and wonder what all the fuss is for years just go ahead and get a pair they are just awesome when i finally got mine i opted for the anniversary edition as they were on sale and i am seeing the regular athm s right now for that s crazy cheap i had some rather inexpensive sony headphones for about eight years still have them actually that are comfy and sound good but not entirely accurate the athm s are really solid studio headphones i can t imagine why i have taken soooooo long to try them for myself they exude quality and are comfy even when i m wearing my glasss which many headphones are not not for long seasons anyway i use the athm s in my home studio and i have started taking them along in my gear bag for studio sessions along with a headphone ext cable i feel oso foolish having lived without these cans for so long don t you do the same i ve been in professional broadcast studios that don t have mics as nice as this one good flat response but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you don t like to eq after the fact sounds like a million bucks this is the best usb microphone out for under bucks it s a shame that its been out for a few years now and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording the sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as i have this fairly close to my computer in my office and i can t hear the computer in my recordings i haven t used this microphone with instruments as i am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video and it sounds great the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows i did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone but it worked perfectly after that i just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock mount yeti combo pack as i have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven t used the base that much since arriving at that setup if you are in the market for an excellent usb microphone look no further you can t get anything better than this for under bucks just make sure you get a pop filter for it and yes the blue pop filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn t just check out my review video for the blue pop blue microphones the pop universal pop filter i don t own the srh s but rather the srh s it was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the s in terms of sound and comfort i didn t believe the sound part but i bought them because i at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my s when i got them they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals they are definitely more comfortable i don t know what it is but something about the sound is different and i don t think it s placebo there seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places i wouldn t expect i highly recommend this upgrade this is a pop filter it does a fantastic job at that the plastic rings feel a little cheap but that is just because they need to be lightweight ultimately this is a great pop filter and the goose neck is very strong but flexible i would highly recommend this piece as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close
603	i recently picked up a used casio privia px and it had a cheesy little square sustain pedal that slipped around and had a terrible feel i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open it also worked perfectly on my roland rd nx but i expected that what i love about this pedal is it has a fantastic feel that rivals a real piano and is the equal to the feel of my expensiveroland rpu one main reason why i gave this five stars in addition to the compatibility is it s built to last it s heavy all metal exterior except for the bottom pad and has a six foot cable that allows you to place it practically anywhere plus the price is right in fact the entire package is impressive when i compared it to other models that i considered and it s light years ahead of the oem pedals that casio ships with their privia keyboards now i can use the clean channel on my amp with this pedal for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel for my other pedals and my electric guitar just make sure you get this when you get the tascam i didn t run it without this power source that seems too ghetto they should just jack the price to what it would be with this and viola but what do i know this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended cfh i have used the line looper in the past line jm looper the line is basically the same as the electronics on the spiderjam amplifier it s a decent looper but it s too big and i don t need all the guitar tones backing tracks etc that go with it so i decided to look elsewhere i wanted a looper that i could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality multiple channels etc and this one fit the bill you can adjust the loop volume switch quickly between tracks turn the background percussion down or off etc i purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracks the only fault that i ve found thus far is that the foot switch cable that digitech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a degree this is weird as all pedals on a board need a degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal to solve this i bought a hosa degree stereo connector it has to be stereo hosa rt angl ster phone f stereo phone m i ve added a photo of the jamman on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thepedaltrain mini with soft casephotos one other great attribute of this pedal is it s built solid and is easy to stomp on you don t have to have perfect aim just good timing there are a few strange nuances though for example you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track this gets the track started before it clears it not good if you were using it in a performance however there are workarounds like just switching tracks overall great deal for the price and if you are looking to improve your lead guitar improv i would certainly recommend a pedal like this one i received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard i was assembling my plan was to try something different to compare against the boss ns noise suppressor on my other board while i love the build quality and simplicity of the one knob setup i can t say yet that i like it better than my ns with the caveat that i may not have it wired up correctly i felt that it did kill most of the excess noise but not all of it good product but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price will update this post after i play around with different arrangements and get more experience with it
604	i purchased this model for home use not for a kid s backpack it s solid and sturdy easily holding a song book open not just a few pieces of sheet music it adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening i often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down works for me this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely the light from the leds has a blue tint to it i d prefer something more white each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting i gave starts because it doesn t get quite as bright as i d like but it does the job it seems well made and will operate off battery power as well as an ac adapter which is included i can t say enough good about this amp i have a marshall jcm which is a great tube amp but side by side this little amp really stacks up first and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp but if you want something that is close well this is it so versatile light weight and well constructed great fender quality for a great price love all the presets i have no problem with buzzing on any channel clean or otherwise excellent guitar amp and i would highly recommend love it
605	my th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks they are good and reasonably priced the principal is mad at me because i told them that a real drummer plays constantly so the walls in the halls cafeteria tables and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly i bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars imagine my profound disappointment really boss this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the top control higher than about o clock at first i thought i must have a defective unit but then i started reading reviews on line seems like it is part of the design it s too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones hidden beneath a wall of fizz totally unusable as far as i m concerned by the way i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat ha amazon rejected my first review because i mentioned a competitor by name chickens let s just say that the price is excellent much better than the competition and the cables work great how s that i m not a big fan of planet waves because they ruined the dare strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder good stuff i ve been using these strings on all my guitars electric and acoustic since the mid s i ve tried many others but always come back to ernie balls they tune better and they keep the new strings sound longer and that s the main plus but they just feel good i play and practice a lot and i abuse strings these can take it and come back for more i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well this is a nice product that is perfect for someone like me basically a one man band guitar is my primary instrument and i am a decent singer but not great this can help clean up my vocals and is helpful if you occasionally stray off key a little very simple to operate like most swiss army knives it can do a lot of things pretty well but none of them great hvr considering the price i think it s excellent would buy it again if stolen as they say
606	i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked they don t play at all like what i was expecting under high magnification the edge doesn t look the same as the old jazz iii either and they don t play the same if you turn them over what s up with that i m sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop let s hope this is just a short term fluke this stand works fine if you don t need a shock mount the base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations i ran into trouble when trying to mount a r de nt a mic on a shock mount the low height which would otherwise help stabilize the mic left too little clearance between the mic and desktop if you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic you re better off buying the slightly more expensiveon stage ds b adjustable desk microphone stand black btw my copy of this stand also did not have the inch male thread i do like this pick i bought a few different types to have a variety to pick from a suggestion from my teacher good suggestion depending on what kind of guitar i m playing on it changes the tone i like this one i bought this pedal tried it out and returned it on the plus side it is quiet sturdy has a reasonable footprint does not suck tone and it is passive but the feel was not quite right for me even with the adjustable tension i couldn t lock it in to where i wanted it i m very used to the ernie ball pedals and i also like the new morley volume plus but to be fair pedal tension is a pretty personal factor and this might easily be a star product for you
607	a little story to back these lock s integrity i installed them on a korean made washburn wg v incredible guitar after tweaking i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar the screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood and i epoxy all my screws in before the strap lock broke amazing nice tough hardware the only complaint i have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided easy to install just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system fast to take on and off of your guitar i would suggest getting a tough thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps i have now switched over to dimarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with dunlop locks for many reasons and i am very happy but this product is grade a i always felt secure with these straplocks our bass player uses some expensive and heavy fender basses and he loves these strap locks this not the first swing hanger i have they are great you will love it our son has four or more of them too my wife plays the fiddle and the mandolin and this stand works great for both of them it even has a bow holder and it is easy to pack and transport the stand is very well constructed and very stable the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders i was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder but then again all guitar stores display their guitars with them so i thought lets have a go i m glad i did my stand doesn t tip over like the others you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out the fingers in front hold the instrument in lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument they do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand the switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey i bought one of these about a year ago and i am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a back up great tuner just clip it on the headstock turn it on and tune display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so i can even do it without my glasses on i have used it in noisy environments other instruments tuning or playing and it still works never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or fender stratocastor the only thing that could use improvement is the auto off function mine has failed to detect an extended duration of no audio energy and as such stayed turned on until it drained the battery after that i got in the habit of making sure i turned it off when not in use and it uses commonly found cell batteries so not a big deal to replace just grab a two pack of them at the grocery store to keep on hand overall very useful accurate device and worth a few extra dollars
608	guitar picks make a huge part of your tone especially on acoustic these are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion they have a long life and do brighten your tone freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or carpet scrap to bring back the original shape this was the first time i ventured into the world of harp i figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too fast shipping no hassles thank you amazon i bought this mostly for the case and to have a few backup harps kicking around if i need them some of the harps are out of tune slightly not a big deal especially considering what all you get here this is an alright set for a beginner and a good cheap backup set for a more advanced harp blower i ll use the case for my higher end hohners as needed i clipped it on the neck head of my acoustic guitarit tunes up well and is very easy to readi turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingi have not used it enough to test the battery lifebut so far so good great for the price all pros and no cons so far
609	completely quite connected with no problem i own two i love these patch cables they can be serviced if need be but mine have never needed it i ve ordered about batches of these guys and i would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex the length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes however there are many cables of much lesser value which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown i have owned almost every octave harmonizer pitch shifter on the market for what this tiny dollar box is capable of you cant beat it first off its polyphonic you wont find that in anything else under instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design only two flaws a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals still doesnt hum as bad as my pog did the only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff i can become very creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settings i have other musicians online who jam with me and i can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where i am going with a song so many things i have developed great tool and good quality product
610	last forever and easy to hold onto not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said my favorite picks i cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after i received the product the cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator the fretboard turned out nicely though so i decided to give it a instead of a i have to say though that i believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn t a bad buy just remember it isn t recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it if you want to use this type of product then i recommend this one my guitar originally came with d addrio exp and they sounded good i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good but the finish was wearing fast this time i got a pack of ej d light the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly but the sound is the problem it s terrible they sound very muddy crisp tone distinction is just not there i thought light would be the better route but now i m not sure i purchased some others to try also since a purchased a pack i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings having recently purchased an epiphone el i went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to graph tech s tusq material it is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with the top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the tusq bridge and pins the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional this was one of the best modifications i have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade i can barely wait i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice it works but expect some flaws first finding a driver to use was a pain it doesn t come with a software disc so look on behringer s support site for driver download whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio you can t run any other media player and get sound my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this get something else good cable doesn t tangle very good ends it sorta cleans strings but not fully i dont even really use it anymore i feel like i wasted my money on this item got it for bucks and wish i d bought about more just as good as anything else out there onlky complant is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as i d like but that s my take on it buy if you need a stand for the money you won t be disappointed
611	i had for years been using elixir strings on mywashburn d simply because i was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch i m glad i tried out these d addario strings these strings are an excellent complement to my washburn which has mellowed out over the years they are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the elixir strings i can t speak to the manufacturers claim of times more life but as of now i d have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money highly recommended although this is hardly a high end microphone it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument although the output signal seems like it could be stronger the stand is sturdy too so this is probably not the best choice for the full time professional musician but for busking around or playing in clubs it s worth a look this gig bag is well worth the price it replaced the cheesy gig back i received with my soprano ukulele and i have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now it has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends get this gig bag disclaimers obtained free as part of amazon s vine program tested on ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players yes this tuner is for you i tested this diminutive tuner on sopranino ohana soprano pono concert kala string tenor pono it s tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there it s a bit problematic on the sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the top tuning is easy just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen if it s red you re off if it s green you re in tune when you re off little bars will display by the note letter left if you re low right if you re high tune in the direction needed until there s one bar on each side of the note and the note s name turns green quick and easy i ve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it s dead accurate as others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock but it s held together fine so far and i ve had it for weeks
612	i bought this to use with my keyboard i wasn t really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals it doesn t work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what i d always used doesn t have the same feel either nowhere close in my opinion a sustain pedal like the m audio sp sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better the only thing i ve found the yamaha fc sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals i was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after i tuned it and began to play my guitar is absolutely beautiful the finish is flawless and it s got that new guitar smell ahhhhhh it does have a pick guard that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog which pleases me it would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick i read one review on a music vendor s website where the reviewer complained about takamine and jasmine printed all over the pick guard and they were right about that but i found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker dah the strings are a little heavier than i like but i ll be changing them in a few weeks anyway the sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything you d expect to pay more for it has a rich full bodied sound i am now a diehard takamine fan i still had the original strings on an epiphone lp guitar i bought last november i know that s bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming it was nice to get these through vine and try them out there is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on it sounds cleaner and brighter i wish i d changed the strings when i first started learning to play because these are much easier to play now it s not much of an issue but it would have made a difference when i was breaking in my fingers those many months ago i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit okay i bought a telecaster brand new back then still have it and love it i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and acoustics on my electrics i love extra light gauge strings only about of us do i can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings anyhow i digress but for a reason light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the found on gibons and esp ltd s when you squeeze the string to fret it with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board with x large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune the cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as s or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board so most capo s work with s and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings so a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone so since i use lighter gauge strings and even s are subject to the same limitation i have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp guess what now i found it i have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked okay so here is how i put it to the test i used the snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it i also have the peterson hd tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy okay back to the explanation with the snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side the only problem is that most any headstock tuner i have seen they aren t superbly accurate the peterson headstock tuner i sent back because it was acting crazy anyhow so the secret to using the snark which i like best out of the headstock tuners i have tried is to tune the open string first and then fret the string on let s say the th fret you will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune even though it may be a little sharp or a little flat so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it so your ears can hear it in order to get it spot on there is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune so by tuning the open string and then tuning the fretted string once both are in tune it is right on so in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp not enough to register on the tuner when you fret that string for example on the th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit making it sharper which will now show on the snark as a note that is too sharp once you balance the open string and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument you don t even need to hear it so your audience is not listening to you tune up yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well so with that being said you can more fully understand why this d addario ns artist capo is the cat s meow it is the first tuner that i ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck it is adjustable like the others are but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well you often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo not with this one even with light gauge strings i must admit i was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on that it immediately did the job just right it wasn t even a little bit sharp to be super critical here is another tip when using this capo put it closer to the fret rather than in the middle between two frets for some reason it stretches the string less in doing so it has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets i did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets with gauge strings since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune the best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example rather than right below the third one right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also just like right above the second one does but it keeps the capo way out of your way as a matter of fact i am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords that i sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong with a little practice or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that to say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand you just slide it down to being right above the fret below it rather than right below the fret above it so there it is this capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp of course if it can accurately handle s it will breeze through anything thicker out of the box it is set at its lightest setting and that is perfect for s on the telecaster i tried it on teles and strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks so it will work the same with both so i guess i can t recommend this capo high enough since it is the only one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings my only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so i can switch it over when using a different guitar i might get another one for a backup
613	strings are not just strings guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar and all martin products are second to none i really love this tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product recommended white thin picks by fender what else can i say they are very good looking the only downside with thin picks is that you tend to keep buying thin picks because they keep breaking because you are playing fast and wild with them compared to ernie ball s cloth it s good enough for wiping down things it is soft and non abrasive eb s cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs overall good cloth for general use i was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what i got there isn t too much to say about it it s sturdy it s adjustable it s a great price it really made playing easier for me this is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest the height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle the seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne i apologize but that is my best reference for comparison assembling is simple and fast i had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances i managed to get it done with no problems another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists the foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals however this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture i used this with drums but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bit the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport it s not a deal breaker on the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience i d suggest that this is not for beginners more for the intermediate musician it is not something you are going to understand at first the learning curve is moderate other than that quite useful and durable at first i thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous but after actually trying one i love it it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow i can honestly say this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out not to mention that it s hard to strum and sounds awful what these picks are good for is leads rock metal shredding and even country the sound is short with a very high tone pitch switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull one plus is while recording i do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking shredding as i did with a plastic pick i still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound but love these picks when things heat up also i d like to add that even though i can play rock you like a hurricane by the scorpions it never sounds quite right until now using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound also these picks have a no slip grip with the fender facing your fingers there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it s very easy to grip and use it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick i can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help comparing it to my old boss tu dedicated guitar tuner this works just as good
614	great set of strings cant go wrong with elixirs a little over priced but i am hoping to get long life out of them to make up for it these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my strat good sustain and strings are holding up well this is a great sounding reverb pedal tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound i ve combined this with a epiphone sheraton ii semi hollow body and have been able to get some awesome deep rich sounds watch out for feedback though the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use honestly i think it has a lot of reverb settings that i won t use very much but there s no problem with them being there i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u etc or if you re just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones this is it this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar my only caveat to this review is that i haven t tried out other reverb pedals but this one definitely suits all my needs d addario makes a pretty good string but i d have to say i prefer the elixir the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir don t get me wrong though i still like these if there s a sale i ll buy some more my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings they sound wonderful and cost very little what s not to love the one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain everything needed came with the combo making it ready to go right out of the box i have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger i will order a smaller size i am trying to learn a few slide riffs this thick glass sounds fantastic on the strings my bad for ordering one too large this thing works great i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable accurate and quick great for between song quick tuning it s a boss pedal so it is rugged and reliable i have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros recording artists and session musicians in and around the dallas and north texas area i play locally and regionally in north texas and see this pedal on almost every guitarist and bassist s boards every night great product well made worth every penny update after using this tuner for a month i can say that i made the right decision fantastic product that every guitar player needs period edit i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board these really are the best tuners out there you should get one today there is no comparison to anything else out there nothing i have looked
615	great stereo sound out of the keyboards my keys had a single stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true channel stereo so we could eq it properly and it worked like a charm i highly recommend this cable got a packet to try but i found they are better than the gator screws that came with my case my equipment is very secure highly recommended does what it is supposed to do it is pretty good quality and durable too quick simple and efficient i would definitely buy again highly recommended it s not fancy but it s well though out and you can t beat the value the edges don t cut your neck and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want like others i had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment the foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want and it flexible thin enough to go through the buckles if needed excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass i don t know if they are the best haven t tried them all but from what i ve tried none are better d addarios are top quality and very reasonably priced my choice for string or string acoustics jim dunlop has produced these for more years than i d like to admit to personal knowledge as long as i can remember i ve had one in my case and one on the workbench there are dozens of wannabe models but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol jim dunlop s i gotta remember not to get the black ones though i seem to lose them to easily or maybe they are really that good and they just get borrowed i ve been playing guitar more than years and have used a lot of electronic tuners the first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use the planet waves pw ct is my new favorite it is very small a little bit larger than a grape despite some of the other reviews i have used it with good results on a strat tele les paul and es electrics and on acoustics from martin gibson national resophonic and voyage air i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low e tuner i didn t expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock i have to read it upside down the pw ct is nicely out of the way even when i play an f chord with my thumb on the low e string it s so light i don t notice it s there the display is bright and easy to see in most light a bit hard to read in direct sunlight but i do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway the display is small a dime can cover most of it but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position the sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it no flat symbol bb is displayed as a the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer the display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning it s red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune for example e i found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs these are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin rough handling will probably break it i notice that the clamp is easily removed so i m guessing planet waves may sell replacements the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it it is a ratchet rather than a clamp you press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around it s meant to be left on an instrument it s small enough that you can leave it on in the case if you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better and larger choices it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget i m going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars other reviewers commented on accuracy if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display this tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary i haven t had a problem except with guitars that have built in intonation problems like old nationals and they need tweaking even after a peterson strobe soapbox especially if you are a new player do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than i have time to list being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill people that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that if ever i had one of these and lost it replaced it with the ns planet waves micro clip on tuner which is not as good this tuner has a better higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs it works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too easily worth the extra dollar it s a little taller than the micro but still very small and if it s behind a headstock it doesn t make a difference visually the main difference is the height if the tuner width and depth are about the same that also means a bigger readout so not really a con i use it on a godin with a slotted headstock positioned so i can see it between the tuning keys easy to use bummed i lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner i ll be getting another one of these soon should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it
616	no complaints whatsoever product is a solid build and prices right knobs work well and the stand doesn t slip legs hold up pretty well also great leather strap nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth it wont dig in ur shoulder like some other straps out there and u can adjust it i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i don t like to play low like to my knees that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and it gives me a great angle for my wrist to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck so i say great buy i give it stars yes dear reader this stand will work as a good support stand for not only my grand concert size acoustic guitar for my five string banjo with resonator and also for my baritone ukulele the stand is sturdy provides good support and looks good i am pleased with my purchase and will probably buy another just like it for my banjo the package arrived in time and was protected by an adequate shipping container
617	like other reviewer wrote previously i received less picks than advertised i received a total of picks i don t know if the people at customs borrowed some from me but i find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem other than that the picks are good seem to be durable and produce a nice sound it s actually sleek looking and although i didn t have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar it s a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there it holds about medium size picks for me and i m sure i ll lose a lot less picks because of it it s almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing is that weird to say just buy it already i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday these are the best strings i ve ever had i love them and may bands use them too nice polish cleaner really works very well on the finishes i have cheap glossy chinese electrics and a matte finish acoustic handy to have when your changing strings to clean that nasty fretboard wow do those things get dirty pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue lasts a long time or squirts will do an entire guitar
618	i have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick seen these and they work great when needed looks good too i like that i can disconnect my strap quickly and easily makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly i buy one of these for each guitar but i only use my favorite strap i have another headstock tuner that i ve had for awhile this planet waves pw is about the half the size and works just as well the clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky but the tuner works like a champ nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions compared to my other tuner it s rigt on the money the other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room i don t have to take the tuner off i have had of these tuners you d think i d learn after one they calibrate okay it s just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device both of mine broke this way to me for the price it s made cheaply try d addario instead love their tuners
619	this stand is great for my lb peavey it is a light weight rack and i had to put the amp toward the bottom i wouldn t put much more in it but it is exactly what i needed i can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily haven t tried gigging with it but if you are gentle i think it would work fine i have been using this little amp very heavily for about a year now and highly recommend it the device is extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next to my mixer it does exactly what i expect the sound is clean works great great price meets my requirements perfectly like title says the item does what it s supposed to you get the headroom you expect from a dollar item i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs i ve had it for a few months and i m experiencing some noise on the pots which i didn t expect i thought it would ve lasted a little longer i can open it and clean the pots but again i expected a little more life out of it battery operation would ve been nice but like i said does what it is supposed to well enough that i ve bought of them
620	i was truly surprised when i saw how nice it was has weight to it and has good sound looks nicely made very good deal for the money can t go wrong not a very cheep made microphone much better then i thought it would be its nice i got mine yesterday and love it it sounds grate i didn t know what amp to get i looked and looked read a lot of reviews and even got on youtube to see what people had to say and seems this one had a lot of good reviews i knew fender has a good name for amps and for the money this one was the one i am so glad i got it it gave life to my electric guitar i bought mine somewhere else but still grate amp i didn t want to spend a lot of money for an amp and didn t want to get something small for or dollars less and would out grow with my music as i get better playing guitar but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will this will save me money in the long run i am very happy with it i like the five year warranty that came with it you can t go wrong great sound and its not to big nice size amp and easy to pick up nice looking amp ok i ve owned of these danelectro amps for one they are cheap in price loud in output and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon recently i purchased this item on ebay for bluetooth audio music receiver v wireless stereo adapter for smart phonesnow i can connect to my tablets smartphones and computers and use this amp as a great external bluetooth speaker plus the battery life is great try to buy a bt speaker on amazon with this wattage that s cordless and works from battery power and you will spend well over the included battery is worthless and dies in about minutes i installed a mah rechargeable v battery ebay and it lasts forever plus i can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when i want for this price its hard to beat this stand is very good nice and strong i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this it is worth a lot more then dollars this will last a life time and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash so i looked for something better and i am so happy to have found this at this price i didn t want to pay more then dollars for a stand but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for or dollars and in months its in the trash i would be buying another one so really this is the best deal i am so happy i bought this stand you can t go wrong with this one realy get it it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over its heavy enough not to it slides up and down nicely and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well bolts are not plastic witch is nice and very easy to put together and fast i got it together in one minute i only used regular pliers to put it together the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument i truly recommend this for anyone i did get the foot guards for to protect floor on carpet you will not need them and it comes with a year warranty and with the free shipping you can t beet it what a nice clear sound it has and smooth nice size for someone with small hands i got this because of all the good things people wrote about it in the reviews sense i always wanted to play so decided to learn and wasn t shore what kind to get so thanks for all the reviews to help me out and i am so glad i got this one it came in a nice plastic case not a cardboard box all throw i did order a case for it witch i will use when i bought this harmonica not shore what harmonica to get on a low budget this is the one you won t regret it i been around blue s a long time so heard many harmonica s this one truly sounds good nice bag padding it good i just wish the hooks weren t plastic not shore how long they will last it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later good design easy to hang on to these picks reasonable price makes it even better i don t often use picks but when i do i use these i will buy more in the future
621	bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price what more can you ask for at roughly this is a very useful guitar compressor it is a simple compressor that s it easy to understand with responsive controls i use compressors quite a lot in my pa rack i have a yamaha rack compressor and an alesis rack compressor in my home studio there are compressors in my track daw and in my computer i have the t racks deluxe mastering software with several vst classic analog compressors like the pultec as well as vst optical compressors i only mention these as a way of saying that i am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them i have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratios attack and release points and i have learned to use them sparringly and with care the behringer cs does a good job as a straight guitar compressor it is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp in recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working it s not being used correctly the behringer cs is quiet almost transparent unlike the behringer dc i discuss below yes it is plastic but it s fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years if you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long time if money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around and up keeley mxr digitech etc unless you go over i don t think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle if your signal path aready has hum and static this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because that s what compressors do lower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound if you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch this little behringer cs will do it behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the behringer dc it is all metal and attempts to clone the classic mxr pedal i personally would stay away from this pedal for live use i bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain you can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference i don t use the dc when i play live but i like it on my guitar when i record using my vox vt amp i like it better than the built in compressor on the vt i just play at home with friends it works well so far on all my ukuleles however every time you touch your instrument it s going to transmit that sound into your amp so it s nothing i d be using on stage if i didn t have to still it seems to be a good value but truth be told i haven t had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue time will tell i love my snark sn tuner it works smoothly without any issues and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately all you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock and it is ready to go the sn is smaller than i expected but the multicolored meter is easily readable and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position using the color coded meter you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp and adjust the string tension accordingly with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process the unit is powered by a cr battery which generally has a long life although the clamp has rubber pads apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage the instructions states that the snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes polyurethane french polish and nitrocellulose lacquer those with gibson gretch or taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning i have had no problems using this tuner on kramer ibanez charvel epiphone and esp guitars the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins i do not have either of those instruments but i imagine the tuner would work much the same as there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock it took me a little while to decide on the sn even after eliminating tuners by d addario and planet waves selecting the sn wasn t that simple as snark makes a number of similar tuners i am completely satisfied with the sn and believe that it fully deserves a star rating it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying if the finish of your guitar isn t an issue you may find the snark to be very helpful what a great little gizmo i had a boss rc looper it involved too much bending over for me and too hard to figure out the ditto is so easy i take my trusty fender esquire a cord plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal take a short cable from the output of the echo pedal to the input of the diitto pedal then connect output of the ditto to the amp set echo for multiple head repeats i like the setting between and on the program select knob then turn off the echo pedal get ready to play play the slow chords to maggot brain eminor d bminor c count each chord as as you come to start back on the eminor press the ditto button one time with your foot it will record you play in tempo its slow when you come back to the eminor you want to press the ditto switch one time to stop recording right before the count its tricky to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat but easy with practice anyway as soon as you press the ditto switch to end the recording it will automatically start playing it back then you turn on the echo pedal and proceed to jam on maggot brain till you achieve groovy ness you don t want to record the rhythm part on to the ditto with the echo engaged that would make too much echo with both the playback and the part you play on top of it both echo drenched no good that would be way too echo crazy it sounds much better and more effective with a dry loop track and a super wet echo second guitar part have fun
622	when i ordered these i wasn t expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly foot cable it turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all i plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static interference or buzz to explain the low price and all i got was a nice clean signal highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable
623	a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps the guides on these are not rollers but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon the only guides that i like better are the round s guides for tele s but then i like those asthetically only on tele s an inexpensive mode that looks and works great to the inexperienced eye this simple clean looking mod can make a mexican or chinese instrument look more like the made in america models i don t know what i would do without this little shelf on my music stand i works on my non manhasset sold shelf stand holds my pencil highlighter flute swab even occasionally a small speaker set that i have for my phone it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure very well worth the i have owned my g th capo over a year now as far as i m concerned it beats all the others i ve owned in the past hands down so easy to use can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed for years i played the original cry baby the vox wah and others i can t remember names of i was always on a quest for a good wah sound that i just couldn t find i didn t want to spend on a wah with a rack so at the recomendation of a studio engineer i purchased this wah about years ago i am very pleased that i followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah i was looking for the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable the user dials in the frequency sweep they want the volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix i recomend this wah pedal over all the others especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking nice strap very comfortable doesn t cut into your body at any point easy to adjust worth the price would definitely buy another this works great with the mustang i amp switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot a great addition to an already great amp at this price it s kinda like the amp itself a no brainer
624	i read a review saying that there bridge was floating out the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping i had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long so i did get to play em but all my strings except the a e popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar which it came with btw the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn have to use pliers sometimes but the strings sound great if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w medium gauge elixirs elixir strings are very nice so slick and last forever compared to standard strings but i will admit d addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often so if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed some people say they are too slick and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way but you will get over that once you see how long they last love elixir strings i bought my first pack over years ago and i ve been hooked they last at least twice as long as traditional copper wound strings and sound even better get these these make my cheap acoustic guitar sound almost as good as my martin no kidding fender picks are some of the best picks money can buy i have used these picks for years now and i just love them this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill but this is the switch for that amp for you get the best good sized heavy duty high quality amp with tons of sound construction solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff sound nice clear loud sound especially for an speaker and w amp you can definitely jam with a drummer no problem or just shred it wearing headphones effects there are amp models i e deluxe metal etc and with these amp sounds to choose from you can apply effects on top of any of the amp models the effects include chorus deep chorus flange tremelo vibration phaser step filter delay ms ms ms reverb large hall small room echo filter octaver etc so what are the presets each of the amp models has been pre programmed with three different presets meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds when you select a preset like the first metal for example the minute you touch the gain knob the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set same with treble bass volume and all other effects the moment you touch any dials or effects knobs you have custom control to tweak each preset just temporarily or save it if you wish it s so great because often i feel i would have made a present slightly more this or that simply grab the gain or change the treble or move from delay to reverb and make it your own very easy ease of use plug in your guitar spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects plug in ipod or computer with mm male cable it s that easy pc software i ve heard their is trouble installing mine said error and did not install on windows i know there are ways to fix this and i will do so when i have some time comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer works for mac or pc get more presets use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer play on guitar rig and amplitude awesome size perfect big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc looks like x to me the front metal looking grill is mesh but quality and looks great tuner super simple doesn t tell you which note is in tune just tells you left right or green in center for in tune all in all when compared to the line spider and many other fender amps this one has the quality sound the dozens of different effect combinations input for a footswitch aux for ipod and usb for computer it has it all i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it the reverb and gain distortion are so clean and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone my guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp don t sleep on this it s for a loud quality amp with s worth of effects peddles built in and did i mention easily customizable so easy i could teach a year old select a preset change the dials you want to change make changes permanent only by hitting save otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them love this amp and i ve shopped every comparable model this is the one hands down worth a minimum of louder than my friends w d one love fender mustang you rock
625	i don t know what i would do without this little shelf on my music stand i works on my non manhasset sold shelf stand holds my pencil highlighter flute swab even occasionally a small speaker set that i have for my phone it easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure very well worth the i m very happy with this stand it is heavy which i knew going in but for my purposes that is a plus the weight makes it more sturdy it folds up compactly so it is quite portable despite the weight adjusts easily and holds its position i bought my first one from amazon over a month ago and simply fell in love with it it cleans polishes wood metal although for strings i use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc with wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids i even recently bought a nd just because and yes the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use i knew it was time when it wasn t wiping off the smudges as quickly it came out with a slightly nappy texture to be expected really but still works as well as ever there is a vast amount of different polish cloth brands out there but you won t go wrong with this one works well as a tuner but i did return it to buy the korg tuner metronome combo thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine however this worked fine as a plain tuner
626	i almost always play finger style without a pick but on the occasion i need a pick i like these easier to strum sounds good to me if you re doing a lot of picking out individual strings you ll probably want something thicker but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good plus pick out a few strings here and there works great for my acoustic dreadnought if i had any complaint it would be that there s nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall it would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger a little cushion that would go between the wall and the guitar no reason i can t make something like that on my own though edit just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won t fit into this hanger nothing worth complaining about but just something to note if you need a hanger for a classical guitar this isn t it i bought this gig bag to carry my fender strat around i m just starting to learn guitar so i didn t really know much about my options i figured i had a fender guitar so i might as well get a fender gig bag little did i realize how good this one really is most gig bags don t come with all these storage pockets there s plenty of room for a few books an electronic tuner string winder strings whatever padding could always be more but that s the case with probably any soft shell bag you buy all in all i like this bag more and more since i ve discovered that all the other options in the price range aren t nearly as good had it for about two weeks and i m about to return it now things that i like d it s a classic fender and i was looking for something of good quality with great price sounds clear and crystal good unplugged this can be subjective but i think this bulletstrat is more comfortable than a les paul simply because it s wider and thinner all the previous four ratings here on amazon and even higher ratings on musician s friend things i don t like much th fret of lower e string is dead and like always i take quality control into my rating account i don t want to bother go to a local shop for a fix never mention that s in addition i couldn t figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound like not a bit i m new to electric but my les paul does change tunes in a much much more obvious way talking about plugged sound it s no where close to unplugged notes are pretty mixed up and not separated clear very loud though i don t know if it s universal i ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches what s worse is they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove i not even sure if i can call it a protective cover because it s pretty weak and thin this is overall an ok guitar consider its price it can be made at least slightly better for beginners on budget with less than i would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price for example me i got a sx deimos les paul which i m in love with now simply everything about it is better and i finally get the feelings of an electric i m glad i don t need to stuck with this anymore according to amazon stars it s ok stars i like it stars i love it stars checked it really is just an okay guitar to me thanks for reading and hope people find their beloved guitars thank goodness amazon doesn t sell this gadget for the forty dollar retail price tag i just got mine today and tried it out the sound quality complaints are no joke there is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the irig or iphone while playing will create a loud static noise don t know if a better quality jack on the irig would ve solved this problem or not but if you re willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings you may find a happy medium that you can live with still the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool if i find the need to really use one of these i ll probably spring for something that plugs into the iphone dock connector until then this ll be a fun toy to play with march just a quick addendum to my initial review i ve since discovered the noise filter in the amplitube iphone app and wow what a difference it sounds much much better now no more hiss no more static i bought this not for the tuner but because i needed a metronome however i had to give the tuner a try as well with my trustysnark sn tunerattached to my guitar s headstock and this snark sn on the table i proceeded to tune my guitar i was impressed that both tuners were showing identical tuning even down to the fluctuations as the note rang out as a metronome i don t know what kind of frills others may offer but this does everything i need to keep in time i only have one minor complaint you can t view the snark sn at any kind of sharp angle you need to view it head on if you place it on your music sheet stand that s great but if it s not facing you or lying flat on a desk you may have trouble reading the screen an integrated flip out kick stand would make this perfect if your going to use on amp get some two sided velcro and stick on amp or two sided tape etc for price its fine amazon is the best
627	apparently one can never have too many guitars and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access very stable the auto locking heads rock folds up pretty compact for travel the optional carry bag is a must imho tis makes it a little awkward to carry overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show what can i say these are great patch cables solid connection not too to stiff and no harmonics that i could detect and i ve had crappy cables that buzzed when you looked at them cross eyed these don t do that no gold connectors and if you need the best of the best maybe you should be looking elsewhere for the rest of us who are looking for good stuff at a good price these are the ticket highly recommended
628	i m not a professional but have been playing for many many years this is the best cord i ve ever had though i m sure eric clapton has something better these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex we ve tried d addario brighter sound d addario acoustic guitar strings set exp lite and martin a little stiff martin strings sp phosphor bronze msp in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar the difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nano s have a very light coating that you almost don t feel so if you like standard not coated strings the nano s are probably the way to go if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar for the combination we have these are outstanding strings on the strings lasting longer that s hard to say fresh strings do sound better it s clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non coated strings but i m not certain these last so much longer we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability corrosion or crud on the string isn t the sole factor in changing strings elixir is a wonderful company on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesn t perform up to your standard the other amazing thing i ve watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and i m still very confused the elixir website it s pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes it is so simple and so reproducible i love this technique this levy s leathers inch cotton guitar strap is good looking in an understated sort of way very well made adjustable and extremely comfortable and works exactly as expected we bought this for my son as a starter strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future highly recommended cfh lots of juice easy settings very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need i haven t jacked it up all the way i don t think the cat would appreciate that i get a little feedback every so often occasionally it s a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar but not enough to submarine this power packed amp how do you get that much noise out of an speaker
629	recently i was building a telecaster project a friend recommended using the way switch instead of the stock way switch this allows you to have the three positions normally found on a telecaster bridge only bridge neck in parallel and neck only it also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in series the result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge neck position and a slightly higher top end output this is clearly a case of your mileage may vary i ve been used to the traditional position switch on my other telecasters i m a bit indifferent to this mod if i was building another guitar i would probably use this switch again it does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the way however i would not change out a working way switch for this for me the added benefit just isn t worth the effort i recently traveled across country carrying similar guitars one was in the skb fender case on amazon the other in this gator case purchased locally i was told it was just as good as the fender case both ended up in checked luggage after flight from florida to lax and back non stop minimal handling the glue on the top section gave up the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape but after having the padding fall out i just ordered another skb fender case the gator will be re glued and used only for local trips the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on i knew it would be small but i wasn t thinking this small it shore is cute good enough for now but not for the long run shore its loud for the size but it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides from vibration if you keep it on lower sound its fine this is only for temporary use for me its an ok tiny mini little amp for it s size its good don t exspect a fender amp thats all very nice compressor i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone sustain can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing quiet much quieter than other compressors in this price range no concerns here i m not sure what i was expecting this definitely is a fuzz but the one i got doesn t seem to have much in the way of subtlety it s either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much it s not bad and it s probably just my personal preferences but this just isn t my cup of tea
630	this filter arrived very quickly i use it with a scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should good purchase just slipped this windscreen on my mic a wireless brand and it barely fit perfectly any smaller and it would be going in the trash the foam is obviously of good quality and it s plenty thick i m using it mainly to protect the mic s metal screen but also to keep others germs off the mic seeing as how they tend to put their mouths on it this mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a sm i liked what it did to live vocals vs an old mic i have that seemed to give everyone small shocks and probably cost way more in the day i originally bought this to check the hype out and can say that i will likely get more as needed instead of buying sm s i have not recorded with this yet but from what i heard online i think it will do just fine what we have here is an xlr male to xlr female black cable if you re looking for some ridiculous review this won t be one quick pros and cons pros it s a nice thick cable it s ft long as promised i measured not really it worked didn t arrive dead consnone really this seems like a nice high quality cable are there better i have no clue i m an amateur i needed an xlr to go with my gls es and this fit the bill plugged into my mixer plugged into the mic and transmitted proper audio from one to the other that s really all it s designed to do thus stars great for carrying with you works as it should good price i would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot this is my first mixer i d been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from usb powered mics like the blue snowball to something a little more professional and of course that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups thus i am an amateur and you ll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional anyway my pros and conspros this thing is way smaller than i expected i can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn t take up a lot of desk space it fits well where i put it it works as intended i use this with a gls es mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good i have my windows volume set at and the gain is up at about i have no hissing and no problems i did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co host we do it over skype said i sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball it s plug and play i plugged it in it installed the drivers and it automatically set itself as the default microphone easy peasy i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately the dials and everything was easy to understand cons you can t plug this into a usb hub or even an ac powered usb hub otherwise you ll get a hiss this needs to be plugged directly into a computer this high jacks your audio defaults in windows to fix it open your control panel open the sound and set your playback device to your speakers to fix the problem your sound will come out through your speakers as intended since i use this as my main mic i left it as default in the sound settings overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs i know there are better options but they are also more expensive and i m on a budget it s a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money if you re like me and a single person doing youtube video voice overs or podcasts this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person worth every penny as long as it lasts i ll update when if it breaks down but until then i do not regret this purchase
631	i got this pretty fast i took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it stars just for value alone i m still shaking my head in disbelief that i got this guitar for the price first the tuner issues that i ve been reading about replace the strings i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune a set of d addario s cured that straight away or whatever you prefer just change them the tuners aren t the best but they are not to blame it s the cheap strings now technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box the neck angle was so off the a string rattled no matter how high i set the bridge the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle yes i could have sent it back but i suspect i would have gotten another just like it i had to spend about hours shimming the neck and the nut never had to do this to the nut on an electric not even on a used guitar the nut slot was cut too deep as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable it required business cards to shim the neck which is the most i ve ever had to use after i got that straight i removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws in my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal but as i m looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work i m steadily staring at the qc passed sticker must have been built on a friday afternoon or something now after i did this it is sweet i play through a peavey valveking and it rocks as good as my strat w duncans and dimarzios the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all after adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them i d argue that this is as good as any epi i ve ever played as far as pups and all so don t hesitate there because i don t really care for epis and i m in love with it i bought this to sell mainly but now the build quality hmm if you can do guitar work go for it otherwise i d highly recommend a more expensive model the models are great right out of the box usually i ve been hooked on d addarios for quite a while the per unit price on these is great and i never worry about breaking one of these these were great i can t brag on them enough i am however an electric gitty player primarily i just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting i ve used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity to use these you put your strap on your guitar as usual then put the locks on rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap once the lock has passed the head of the guitar s strap button rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up close position which should be about degrees from open position very simple and works very well i have not used any lock system that s perfect every one that i ve used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly these work exceptionally well what i like about this design is that it doesn t require any modifications on the guitar or the strap you can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you don t have to replace the guitar s existing strap buttons but they do stick out a bit to keep the strap from sliding off so if you re concerned about looks you might want to try another system that s more discreet also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends these will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons i use these at parties and they work good for the price i paid i really have no complaints aside from sometimes you really have to get up on it to get a good clear voice in a live band setting i use a wireless for that now still for the price these are hard to beat seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks i wasn t expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner i have to say it is one good funny looking clip on tuner many useful functions i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything like the capo and metronome feature i just really like this little guy good job snark received these with lightining speed they came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up alot of adjustments to these and they actually adjusted high enough for me at to be able to sing at lemmy s angle great for singing micing amps and such these are each at a local music store so update these are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer s mic but if you grab it with some enthusiasm the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand i used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that i still say they are good for the price just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen they work great with my pedals not sure if it s the pedals or the cords but i noticed with my full rig and using all the cords there is a noticeable hum in the background i m sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well i can deal with it
632	this quality bag would probably cost more like at your local music store appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers not terrible but somehow chemical hope it goes away soon first i bought a fm dsp on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store that was my mistake i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks well here it is friends in all it s glory tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price it s loud it s clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it add a danelectro distortion pedal of some sort off amazon for distortion and you re home i own nine amps including fender crate and peavey tube models and this is cleaner if you play c w look no further if you fingerpick this is your amp electrified banjo mandolin or violin this is the amp but if you follow the darker side keep looking my first review was a knee jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it i couldn t get it to sound like i wanted it to i was so wrong in giving it only stars i must now rerate it with a star this amp does almost too much for the money my only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has it can do anything and sound any way you want it too wow i never knew my guitar could sound like this it actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have i am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite amp when i totally figure it out if i ever do the sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings so in short forgive me as i have sinned and judged too early buy this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it if you are looking for a small plug and play amp this isn t it but it you re looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities this is it it is growing on me and i wouldn t part with it now inexpensive and practical you don t have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this just about any angle will work needs little space another plus
633	still using it today years later i wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin these will work for soprano the j is a good investment for under bucks they provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play increases projection and tone to any stock strings not the best not the worse strings but an improvement use this for my desk mic at home it hold my mic right where i want it and doesn t move from where i place it worth every penny and then some works as expected clips onto pretty much any mic stand the movable head is awesome i write and record my own music when i upgraded to a new computer with windows it wouldn t support my m audio fast track pro so i had to upgrade the focusrite scarlett worked right out of the box i replaced the stock cable with a monster cable and my recordings sound great very easy to use just plug in a microphone or guitar set your levels and start rocking
634	the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire pin then ties to pin with the ground wire i use this to run a single mono xlr shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my tascam dr which saves me a step in post production the quality is fine and it does what it s supposed to do good price for a good product i first used this pedal when my green screemer died a friend had and os on hand and let me use it i had used boss s metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking so i plug into the os and i was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the os pedal produced i play through a fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones i have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and i am still impressed i have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end my search ended with this pedal i highly recomend this pedal to any rock blues metal country or punk guitar player this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians for years i played the original cry baby the vox wah and others i can t remember names of i was always on a quest for a good wah sound that i just couldn t find i didn t want to spend on a wah with a rack so at the recomendation of a studio engineer i purchased this wah about years ago i am very pleased that i followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah i was looking for the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable the user dials in the frequency sweep they want the volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix i recomend this wah pedal over all the others especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking excelent product great quality and useful in many different ways i specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing since it can record up to seconds and it will not end unless you stop it this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos i also have it connected in a fxs loop with the mustang fender iv and it works just perfect in stereo mode the reverse mode rocks allows you to do great fading delay violing efect this is simply the best pedal i got since it s so versatile i do play metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ love it
635	easy to usegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much i keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one i am using this on my martin string the spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok will need to check them next week or so if you are like me and truly value your usually expensive prized instruments then you want to make sure nothing happens to them accidentally or otherwise the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest they have a better base design and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling no worries just make sure you lower it all the way as it is designed to be these things are awesome also everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands all of the other tri stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together not here plenty of room for everything now this stand and the double version which i also own lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture also the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet with all other stands i am always worried that my guitar will slide off or if it gets bumped that it could fall out this mechanism holds it tight until you want it and releases it very easily and naturally for you but will not let it go while it s just sitting there check these things out you will not be disappointed also as for durability i have used and abused my hercules stand for years tossing it around my car to play at different places it s been tossed dropped setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when i first bought it it doesn t even have any obvious visible scratches on it it came with a bag but i discarded it and never used it meanwhile i had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before i bought the herc i will only every buy herc stands from now on it does a good job for it s primary purpose as a capo so i gave it four stars it works flawlessly but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn t easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood tis makes it a little awkward to carry overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great i am average build and play a strat i shouldn t have to feel like this thing just barely fits me i wish it had at least one more inch looks great feels great and works great the leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely great i love it nice strap but a bit too stiff might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying well built and good adjustability would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice it is a little stiff feeling compared to the others i have purchased but overall it is very nice such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes worth every penny mind you does require some length and height adjustment for some epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put so far so good i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together the glue didn t hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund warehouse deals are not such good deals another great roland product really easy to use and well built very good sound great for practice certainly do not get the rc get this rc model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later i did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big check for sales or demos
636	i had to make some adjustments on the neck of my martin d and remove the bridge pickup this left the saddle too low to the neck i researched the tusq products and found enough people impressed to give it a try i m pleased to say i find more ring through the body and a better sustain i ll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on haven t got to far into this thing yet but i do like it same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with definitely get some odd tone change to work with here i d say check your youtube channel to hear for yourself if not familiar with the tones this does some fairly cool things to the sound but there is a lot more out there this would be great for a new person experimenting with effects
637	i was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet i keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget it stays in tune and don t let the laminated top scare you its great i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel these strings are what i needed and they perform d addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar i do own a few behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range and this pedal will stay in my collection i ve spent for a few of my pedals but i order and try many other pedals within the same effects range because some i believe are just to costly for what you get and the sound quality usually are not that far apart i would put this pedal in that category this is my st compressor pedal and while i dint think i really needed this type of pedal for the price i thought i would give it a try wow the behringer dc dynamics compressor pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal board plus i get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set so i can go quiet on an apartment at late hours with a watt amp that s nice so i would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal cheap works great for playing and foot controllers will not handle bulk dumps so i have to use a different interface for programming and backups i really like this delay it s simple and works well i really am starting to love behringer great pedal for a great price
638	i haven t owned my electric guitar for over a year but i ve only replaced its strings once i ve been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new at this rate it seems that the current strings i have installed would last forever would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set the power supply which is not included is a funky size it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but i wouldn t recommend it only because it is not the proper size the guy that was using this was using it with a fender telecaster and a single tube amp he found that the volume was cut by even with the pedal turned all the way up any time a pedal allows for volume loss it tends to effect tone yes mr sound engineer tone is a real thing the pedal is pretty bulky and won t fit well in most pedal boards but it s not any more wide than the morley but it seems to be taller longer and heavier i gave it stars because it s okay but it is far from great and i would not buy this product again i understand the price is cheap and if this is all you can afford then go for it but if you have the extra cheese spread it i used to use the tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these i ended up using that pick for something like years playing times wk once i started playing hrs wk at my church i decided that this pick had proven its self so i order a small box i have never dropped one of these and have never broken one fyi i generally don t play hard and i always play acoustic nanoweb custom lights
639	its much better than what i got with my violin its been good i can t really complain considering its basically tree sap alright for the past years i ve been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string and let me tell you doing this process on guitars sucks this tool is awesome it takes about minutes to change strings now and it s well made and durable the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine i ts not perfect but neither am i so stars would recommend to anyone in my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself i attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually i fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history i just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty just be sure to buy thekorg cm l clip on contact microphone for tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing love this stuff i have been using it for years and it always does the job well cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent cleans off grease fingerprints old beer and restores that sweet shine this is a good quality product as advertised fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument i am satisfied these are fantastic and unique guitar picks i love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well it s always nice to have a conversation item and these little ones age great to show off to your guy friends love them and they re good quality picks too so i will use them these picks are nice they re great for metal if you like a durable pick the paint fade away after a while but don t let that stop you it leave no residue on your guitar and these have never broken on me the only reason i would buy more is if i lost some over time these are a lighter tensioned version of their popular j strings the pitch is somewhat lower than the j s and the effort needed to fret a note is much less nice for old fingers and beginners simply the easiest no hassle no mess way to clean your strings i have used on all my guitars it even fits my acoustic string update year later and the string cleaner is going strong wash up in soap and water and let dry i bought a nd one it s a working violin my daughter likes it her violin teacher suggests to up grade the strings and a new artino magic pad the shoulder rest is way too high for my daughter but i don t count that as a defect i like many things about this tuner the fact that it turns off quicker than most and you only have to press the button to turn it off unlike the fender which you have to press and hold may not sound like a big deal but if you need to change tune in the middle of a show this one s faster the fender tuner in my opinion and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up but this one s cheaper ahh decisions decisions still you can t go wrong either way i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews when i use my music stand i just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job this is that device i leave it on my stand and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger and it s on and i can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the snark head tuners in addition this one has a metronome i like this very much and may well buy another enjoy
640	works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too i wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin these will work for soprano the j is a good investment for under bucks they provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play increases projection and tone to any stock strings not the best not the worse strings but an improvement in our acoustic guitar band i often play intros and solos heavily amped but when the rest of the band members come in my strumming overpowers the rest so i needed a way to throttle back to either nothing or slightly amplified in between intros and solos then apply full power as needed this volume control foot pedal works exactly as described also i had an extra volt netgear router wall wart that saves battery life during practice i use the battery during gigs despite some comments i ve seen the battery is extremely easy to change no problem at all the device does reduce some of the signal going to my amp hence only stars works well very well constructed would it kill ya to add an on off switch so that the batteries don t run down other than that it s perfect
641	what was it brillcream a dab will do ya something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning worth the coin spectraflex makes great cables i bought this right angle red cable for my older ibanez guitar this cable is built to be extremely durable is made in the usa and comes with a lifetime warrantee the gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial especially compared to a cheaper fender cable i had been using that required almost constant tightening though spectraflex cables are not the least expensive nor the most expensive they are a great value and i am definitely a fan i recommend this cable without reservations i put it on the boom of my mic stand tight on some not on others i need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place the jim dunlop cb capo has a powerful spring and works on both and string guitars just squeeze and slide it where you need it available in several finishes to match your taste this is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars the upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over the stand can be used with or without the upper brace on mine the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as i d like it to be also the feet don t spread as wide apart as i d hoped a few more inches would have been appreciated all in all a good but not perfect stand in my band we have a song where i use a kazoo for one song and i needed a way to store it until needed this cup holder does the trick it also holds my water bottle with no problem the problem is it doesn t do both at the same time that s on me this is a good product for what it does i have a home brew pedal board with pedals on it this allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems the blue led lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions not a bad price either
642	i use different kinds of picks this one is very special the strings rings out really pleasant and great for speed picking too if you like jazz guitar picks and if you like tortex picks this is the perfect marriage these are the best enjoy ever since i saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used jazz picks and after having tried them that he simply couldn t use an other pick i decided to try them out and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks i always had issues holding picks and keeping them put while i played and the jazz iii was no exception so it didn t bother me meaning i didn t really feel like there was a problem other than me being that problem then i read about this new ultex thingyit looked like a jazz iii and every one seemed to like it sooo i figured why not have a go at it i was skeptical about this impossible to drop thing which i read so i was dieing to feel them well they came i tried them and after playing for a while i didn t even notice that i hadn t once readjusted my pick not once it was like there was no pick i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be it stays there to me that s just freaking incredible holy wow i love this thing love it love it if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller
643	i ve been using dunlop nylons for almost as long as i ve been playing guitar twenty one years now i find the s are just a bit too thin but for more chord strumming style playing such as playing rhythm the s are perfect they are flexible but not flimsy the tips will wear down after a while as with all picks i estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you ll get with a pristine tip however they re definitely still usable after that one other advantage these picks have is that they never break so i dont see how you can go wrong nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad it serves its purpose and is simple which i cannot complain about i have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body people watching me can t really see it and it s right where i need it full of picks if i drop one wonderful little invention buy it if you don t want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket tried them all these are the best sounding in my book they last pretty long for non coated strings and play nicely too love this capo on my electric guitar i can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily tried other more expensive capos but this one is the winner there seems to be a trend in using a ukulele in modern music these days a guitar player for years now i decided to give it a try this was a low risk cost way for me to get my feet wet without committing it takes a little getting used to with such a small instrument little neck and only strings but it sure is a blast to play i wont be making an upgrade any time soon but the sound and build quality is reasonable for the price and for the few songs i use if for it will serve me fine highly recommend nifty little item that does what it s designed to do realistically it s not worth yes save your money i regret this purchase for what i paid for it i love my snark sn tuner it works smoothly without any issues and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately all you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock and it is ready to go the sn is smaller than i expected but the multicolored meter is easily readable and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position using the color coded meter you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp and adjust the string tension accordingly with a little practice tuning becomes a quick and easy process the unit is powered by a cr battery which generally has a long life although the clamp has rubber pads apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage the instructions states that the snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes polyurethane french polish and nitrocellulose lacquer those with gibson gretch or taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning i have had no problems using this tuner on kramer ibanez charvel epiphone and esp guitars the tuner also works for bass guitars and violins i do not have either of those instruments but i imagine the tuner would work much the same as there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock it took me a little while to decide on the sn even after eliminating tuners by d addario and planet waves selecting the sn wasn t that simple as snark makes a number of similar tuners i am completely satisfied with the sn and believe that it fully deserves a star rating it is also the least expensive of the tuners i was considering buying if the finish of your guitar isn t an issue you may find the snark to be very helpful
644	hey i got this and an ovation idea from go dps i couldnt be happier with these items especially the ovation idea i have to brag on go dps some they are wonderfull dealers i look forward to buying from go dps again ernie ball is the standard for guitar strings i tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the ghs boomers and d addario i have to say i only had a pack of slinky strings during my last setup and i m glad that s what i used because they play great and sound amazing it works great it keeps my music in order i am able to see my music this has been a very useful tool works great just what i needed to have to walk all over the room now i sit in my chair works well very happy holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened this bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount i am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an ernie ball strap the raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest
645	i m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they re what they are guitar picks however the price was good i was using the standard version of these i saw these at amazon and figured i d give them a try these cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables i was using however the ends seem much more well belt doesn t make a difference in the sound i don t know but i am satisfied with this purchase so far i really like these the thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light medium the grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool i got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out i doubt i will lose them this might be a really really nice stand but the one i received was defective one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won t attach so i have to return it for a refund i ll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it s intact this time
646	this little amp kicks major ass dood i think i may have blown the speaker or it s just how it sounds but it s great for a lo fi kind of fuzz e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up the clean tone is really nice too a little to bright for my taste but for a mini clip amp it s not too bad i can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away theres a headphon jack a v power supply and that s in for plug ins no line in so you can t plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well if you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great this product has a simple function but if you need a v adapter this is the one to get i trust the planet waves brand long wait for overpriced item arrived on time but there was a week wait overpriced but was expected as fender name on product
647	my son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on christmas morning i am pleased with this product very good guitar strap thick nylon webbing material well sewn and the leather ends not only look sharp they hold really well on your guitar studs the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar i would recommend this strap to all it was great to get quality christmas gifts that my son was pleased with the budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town so thanks to amazon for making this possible
648	it s okay i ve bought stands for less that were more balanced and sturdy and the little safety strap is a nuisance more than a help this is a fine stand for the price but i was honestly surprised at how light it is i honestly think on stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price i do use this stand but i wish i would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future it works fine just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past i ve been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately and this is my favorite purchase as of late i ve bought nice straps but when i m practicing for hours at a time this foot rest is a great reprieve and literally a weight off my shoulders all i wanted was a simple tuner that s what this is if you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect pros works fast accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale cons built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped also tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room fyi snark makes more complex tuners which are actually cheaper on amazon that also have or extra features
649	d addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and i have yet to find a better buy i am proud to have this product fits my fender well looks amazing great quality in it also i am pleased i love this tuner its awesome to use and efficient the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are to my ear it sounds good but you never know
650	i bought this guitar about years ago and i have played tons of different acoustic guitars from taylor to fender and more this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well i love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars additionally this is my favorite guitar and i would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic this guitar could very easily pass as one of the dollar guitars the guitar has no finish which i prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature i promise you won t be disappointed and i have been playing for years so i know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar thanks takamine tried them all these are the best sounding in my book they last pretty long for non coated strings and play nicely too don t know what i expected for such a cheap price but this product s quality is in line with its price also the fit over my ukulele s fretboard is very tight making it hard to put on and remove it fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection storage compartment could be larger but good for extra strings and picks you can t fit a full sheet of paper or an x paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment i would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarcross straps work well for carrying zipper system works well it is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price it fits my jasmine es c dreadnought acoustic electric guitar just fine you really can t beat it for the price i wasn t expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner i have to say it is one good funny looking clip on tuner many useful functions i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything like the capo and metronome feature i just really like this little guy good job snark
651	i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine they do what they are supposed to do but i know i can spend a few more dollar dollar bills and get a higher quality cable but the tonal difference wouldn t be anything significant one spot has become the standard it is not cheap but it is well made and useful with this you get the power adapter the extension cable to hook up multiple stomp boxes and a bag full of converter cables the power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet so far i have used it successfully only to power two pedals so i cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board but i am sure it would do so without issue as i have seen other do it without a complaint works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too cheap the best way to describe this stand it serves it s purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand
652	i have purchased of these strap locks i would recommend them to all they work good very solid hold thanks i do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a lp case i have bought a lot of stuff here on az so looked at this one and had it shipped to him he says its great so that is my review prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping stars is my tops anywhere i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks a friend and i have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing restoring older guitars my friend had a tele custom made for him and needed a case so i ordered this one and it hits the spot the neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesn t move at all my buddy likes the case so i am happy nothing gets stars there are no generals present i retubed my carvin x combo with a duet of mullards and of these eh preamp tubes wow they all come to life and make the amp sizzle the price was right from amz i love snark tuners this not being the first one i bought nor the last i loved the fact that i didn t have to press all the buttons like the other ones just get it relatively in tune by ear then this thing will help you with the rest my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip it has already pulled up and i only put it on and off my guitar maybe times so far i mean i ve had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad i m just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe
653	for those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you and it folds up keep it right in your case very cool tool to have thanks these picks are great the best part is the pack i always have spares this is a thicker pick i would recomend you actualy try one before you by of them the only complaint comes from my wife since they tend to pop up all over the house i am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment paired up with a nice pop filter this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings you d be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic it took me some time to get the hang of miking amps positions and vocal distance but i am truly getting more than my money s worth for what it s putting out check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing i am very glad i made this purchase i ve owned this mic for years if you re curious about durability i keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost what more could you want i had to get used to this tuner at first i have used a different brand up until this purchase an experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me glad he did the price is way affordable on this site and it s really easy to use
654	fist off guitar center had this for bucks i know right it was in front of the tag for this bucks and the sp for so i got it but it was in the wrong spot i went got the price tag and after minimal drama they gave it to me for the price they had it incorrectly listed that said the pedal is great the problem people have with the pedal as i can see it if they say it or not is that some sounds don t have the same sustain as a piano or synth sound it has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to pump the pedal to keep sustain and not wash out the tone this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth i have a casio wtk i believe it is as good as you need as said any over sustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again which is the true art of it bucks robbers it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt i don t use it for feedback i use it to protect it from the dust it fits tight but it s fine i like the drum machine and the tuner but i don t like the effects i don t have an electric guitar i only have acoustic electric guitars and i thought that maybe i could make it sound like an electric but the sounds are distorted and not very clean it sound muff for an electric guitar maybe it would work fine but not for an acoustic electric guitar we have my grandpa s really old mandolin now so my dad and i wanted a nice case for our year old mandolin i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work well it works just fine the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there it arrived on time i have an epiphone hummingbird acoustic guitar so i needed a pickup for do some recording it works well but it s not very loud this thing should sound louder next time i ll buy a duncan pickup this is a good product these work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on i like
655	i get everything on amazon now need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment he makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings i do not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time stretch them bend them and they don t break if your bending a couple steps or more then i would love to know what string holds up consistently thanks much i have used these strings for years and this was a great price shipping time was good these tubes just aren t for me they don t sound great kind of flat and lifeless also unreliable one out of arrived doa and another has failed since i like the adjustable tension of this capo i don t think its as easy to put on a kyser capo of this style but once on the neck the planet waves ns tri action capo moves easily and has even pressure across the fingerboard a result of the adjustable tension i surmise some day i will use the pick holder not right away some night when i m feeling i need my pick held d addario strings are like the kias of the string world they make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time these strings are ok i ve always been partial to nickel wound particularly semi flatwound but i digress my typical strings are elixirs so i m used to them lasting a long time in this case the strings sound good like most nickel strings do but they didn t last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless and stopped keeping intonation accurately so like most d addario strings so they re not bad but don t expect them to last like elixirs do you get what you pay for this is one of the nicer capo s ive used certainly superior to the old school band based jobs from yesteryear one of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab position release and go heck you could probably place it mid song if you were so inclined to do so also it clamps without bending the strings i ve used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints i hardly ever use a capo but if i need one i am glad to have this one
656	it makes restringing way easier it s pretty stable and sturdy it will work on pretty much any guitar so far iv used it on my electrics and my taylor acoustic in my experience these cables were not great the connectors rattle they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise i can t expect miracles at that price point but i certainly expected better i avoid this brand of cables i just got this and i ve noticed that it when i activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone i have a crybaby that doesn t have the range the does but its x s more transparent there may be other factors at play here as it is new but the lesson is try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you lifesaver i bought this and a planet wave s o port which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well i use this at every show where i have to plug in this is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn t want to worry about feedback this is great but i needed an actual sound hole cover i bought this along with the planet waves screeching halt sound hole cover though only using it for a short time i did notice the bottom end seemed more focused i had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy so i wanted something that would grip the ipad this stand does the trick i don t have to worry anymore about my ipad falling off of the stand some people have said that it s not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position i have not found that to be true since i ve had the stand i have never droped the ipad out of it a lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic because of the way that i stand with my guitar it s hard for me to see the thing when i use the clamp kind this one uses the mic clip treads and because it s on it s own stand i can put it anywhere at any height and see the ipad the only drawback is you can t have your ipad in a case or you have to find a case that s ultra thin otherwise it s great i have other capos and decided to try this one and i have to say i love it i have used the kyser spelling for years as my favorite and that is a good capo but i will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz i will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up but i love it so far i use it on my taylor ce taylor e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
657	small light and stays out of the way it just works folds up if needed for travel i use with stratacoustic i use this all the time it s pretty basic but really good for a beginner not all chords are in here but the core chords are worth the price as i am one of those forever beginners when it comes to playing a guitar i may not be able to tell you all that this capo does the reason i ordered it is to hold my strings so i can set my guitar i may play around with it to see what all it does good price just as described
658	i bought this because i wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short i m pleasantly surprised with this cable it s decent sound and decent build quality for a good price i have been playing guitar since i was years old over decades and i must say this was a very pleasant surprise i haven t had an electric in years and didn t have the budget to get a gibson so picked up this epi les paul instead along with a fender mustang i amp great combination this guitar has a very sloid feel and came set up perfectly right out of the box all it needed was tuning unlike others i didn t feel that the strings i got needed to be changed right away but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them replaced mine with ernie ball not even slinky s and couldn t be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds great sustain beautiful harmonics the clean tones are warm can get nice blues tones out of it and superb thrash metal too very versatile it does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasn t really meant to the action is extremely easy fret board has a great feel to it good width on the neck not too slinder but not too thick it just feels good in your hands the finish on this product is very nice one thing though the pick guard is kind of a tan cream off white color not bright white as pictured but it still looks great also not mentioned in the description but this does come with a foot cord but it s not the best quality would recommend picking up a new one when you order overall this is well worth the that they list as the msrp at less than half that its a steal if you are considering this instrument don t hesitate now a days i just search amazon because they have always got what i want at reasonable prices this is no exception i am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my epiphone les paul custom pro to the guitar guy for setup etc this was was better then i expected it is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit in other words great all around i know it sits on a self with many other guitars when i take it in to the guitar guys so i am perfectly confident that it is well protected and it is lockable with key if you are looking for a more then good case for your epi lp just get this one you will not be disappointed also i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day no special shipping maybe it is my locations but that was great too well packed serves the purpose i needed a stand at home and this does just fine i liked the price i would prefer the cradle not to swivel but i am happy very nice guitar pics sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics very lovely size was as expected great sound luv it i had version and this amp isnt much different they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software
659	this thing works great and it looks very stylish with the guitar hanging on the wall this also keeps it away from the kids who always seem to want to play it very good idea and holds it perfectly love love love this pick holder this is the second pick holder like this that i have purchased for different family members it s semi secure on carpeting or hard floor but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand the bottom piece has no way to lock in place and although with the guitar on it it is more stable i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall this one meh not worth the purchase in my opinion booooooooo i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes easy to use and perfect size
660	makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body everything conditioned and polished great quality product highly recommend these plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for if i buy more in the future i will be checking here first xlr cables are hard to mess up these are great they do the trick why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap i have large hands i wear an xxl glove but i guess not thick fingers ring size if you want to use this one on your ring finger consider getting a smaller size as for the tone of the slide it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass nice to see something well made for a change most guitar straps i see that are less than are all cheap and that fake stuff these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch the soundis full and fills the room
661	quiet almost hum free clear respose no volume control doesn t befront me because i use it to record to play thru a pa where either i or someone else keeps the volume under control it tends to be bass heavy but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that i had used one in the past this is a more solid unit fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar also in two others i use here and there great job great value got herre quick in a nice little carry bag i will update if problems come later don t see why or how tho i didn t know what to expect given the price but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money i am impressed by the quality of materials components and construction for example the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed they work smoothly and firmly hold the strings in tune the instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box the action didn t seem inordinately high but i couldn t resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so and now the guitar plays even better i might tinker some more at some point probably when it comes time to replace the strings but for now i am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full bodied dreadnought which is rich and resonant and very impressive i still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price but the proof is indisputably before me this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar i use this to play in the church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold i was happy this thing doesn t tip over easily which is perfect for my teen son who isn t all that easy on his equipment adjusts easily enough and the price is perfect i ll try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said setup was fairly easy although the instructions were downright cryptic the adjustability is wonderful and the kit looks phenomenal out of the box that being said one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them i ll soon contact the company for a replacement the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard and even then it s no guarantee and i m guessing due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads the snare often activates when i strike the hi hat at first glance the different tone kits don t bring much to the table but there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls to a small extent i ve even been able to cover up the less than responsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces my only other complaint is that the bass drum doesn t bring much to the table it sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal in short this kit was somewhat defective out of the box but it s still fun to use so unless you plan to record with your electronic kit i d recommend this product as a fun musical toy but it s certainly not up to par with some of the more expensive kits i ve used and recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare
662	cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and don t break end up losing them verses breaking this mm is a bit soft for my liking will go a size thicker next time i m not a pro by any means i am enjoying this guitar it has all i expected it to have in terms of playability and range it may tend to overdrive a little bit more than my other guitars again not a pro one of the screws by the jack was loose nearly stripped when i got it a drop of wood glue fixed it had i paid or more for the guitar i d have been upset but as is that was an easy fix my biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less natural that the image appears to be it s pretty enough and fine for a guitar but i really wanted natural wood and it isn t otherwise it would be a star i play it every day these strings have a powerful tone for lead work however they re not on the bendy side which is great for rhythm work the tone you get from these is punchy powerful and great for rhythm if you need an overall great set of strings get these you won t regret it these are really well made straps for the money the only problem i had was that i wished i had ordered more of them i bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an all in one guitar amplifier etc kit that finally went bad seriously for the price these can t be beat i d even pay a lot more for them don t let the off brand name put you off go ahead and get them you ll be glad you did i m using mine on a strat straight into the amp and also through effects pedals and through both paths they work great no added hiss or other noise no pops or cracks nothing perfectly quiet cables that deliver the signal from the guitar at full strength without modification get em
663	yes these strings are amazing i discovered these on my new taylor and now i ve put them on all my gits they really are the better string i was a fan of ernie ball on my electrifieds and d addario on my acoustics but no more i m only using these they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings but it s worth it put these on my prs se and i love em i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe they were a perfect fit no problems whatsoever a bit invasive and awkward i like another brand more because they feel a little more solid these feel a bit weak
664	look it s a plastic box that s just square and deep with a cheap three inch speaker inside it produces decent sound although there s substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital static from my computer it s ok as a practice amp but i certainly wouldn t want to perform with it in short it s only a small step above toy level which is what you d expect for a twenty dollar amp that doesn t mean it s not useful but you need to be realistic about what you re getting here if you play a string instrument this one is a must i have several and a snark for each one unfortunately in the span of about two years they ve gone from about in bulk to about double that it s a good product but shop around wisely for the best price and hint read the fine print if they include a battery you ll pay lots more i even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store five stars for performance take away one for greed and another comment in i decided to buy more but went to another source which only charged one shipping price not shipping the epiphone comes wrapped in protective foam inside a gig bag which is inside a sturdy standard tri shaped box which is itself shipped inside a huge box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic that huge box is then inside yet another huge box honestly to protect this better they d have had to contact tony stark it would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping excellent job stars on that alone size overall length fretboard nut to bridge so good overall medium size i like that it s a bit larger than a soprano uke it is concert size which i greatly prefer over soprano frankly i d like to see a baritone version the length is an excellent size for both adult and youth child fingers quality from stern to port this instrument shines beautifully lacquered flawless finish protective edging plastic finger guard which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic solid neck screw joined to heavy wood body the whole unit is heavy wood and very durable nevertheless the sound is quite good the tuners are acceptable quality nothing amazing but they work well the frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes the amp jack is chrome metal back plated to the body it s not coming loose strap holders are already mounted saving users the hassle and of course the impressive epiphone and les paul signature stamps on the head for sheer class sound i found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box despite the fact it s pretty solid wood electric i expected it to sound dull it doesn t but i still bought a set of d addario strings a brand i ve loved for years and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added action i ve rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception the action is fairly high not uncommon with off the shelf instruments one will need to remove the strings keep them for emergency spares file down the bridge bottom easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper and add a new set of quality strings i m a perfectionist when it comes to action as are most players i know so this will be tweaked durability it s very durable that counts for the gig bag too no cheap tent nylon there but thick nylon that will really resist tearing as others mentioned i d still look for a decent hard case they average under a good instrument is worth protecting but i d say this could take some real punishment and still play well not that i d go bashing it against a stage floor that would be goofy weird suggestion hang on to the box it comes in it makes a great temporary hard shell case it s made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke great for hauling around in your car if you can t shell out for a shell seriously that is some stiff cardboard protects well electronics the sound is clear sadly there is no volume tone control no battery to preamp and thus the signal to the amp was quite low they could have done better on that end but wow at this price how can one gripe two solutions to this open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible that s the tricky way put a preamp on this you can buy one here on amazon for about bucks if you have a mini mixer you can do the same thing with that even with that little extra expense you ll come out ahead aside from the passive electronics this is a prime instrument it is a mid size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano if you re careful and don t tune it too quickly or a baritone guitar th st string e high depending on the strings you choose considering what you get for the price i don t think this can be beat unfortunately my extra long fingers find this very difficult to play something i didn t consider when ordering a uke but that s a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument the product itself is excellent this boom has cleaned up my desk quite a bit and is great value for the price performance ratio i have an at in it and it holds it in place with no problems wish i would have known about it sooner
665	the price is a great selling point just by itself i use it with my acoustic guitar and the on stage fs b guitar foot rest that i bought off amazon as well it s a good combo it leads me to playing for longer periods it s solidly constructed it folds and is definitely portable great buy this thing is useless good idea but way too light rickety to be useful unless you re constantly aware of it of the time you ll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it pass on this i ve bought three of these now this is an awesome well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily the most recent was for something rather unique a fanned fret compound scale eight string and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare there are more expensive options out there but for a non fitted do it all case this is the best bang for your buck hands down i am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs great case great price i have a lot of high end instruments and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying this stuff is fantastic much better than lemon oil dries a lot cleaner and doesn t leave any oily residue on the board at all an hour after it s applied it sets up and doesn t get on your hands i apply it on occasion with the strings on i use elixirs and have never once had a problem the best few bucks you ll spend on guitar care stars not much to say here they re knobs they look good are well made and fit perfectly on the cts pots in my guitar
666	when i first saw this item i wondered why is the regular guitar version and the bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and i realized the bass version only has to tune four strings instead of six so it costs less because we don t need to use it as much but then i remembered there are string bass guitars and i thought okay shouldn t they have a one for string bass guitars sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when i realized with some dismay that there are even string bass guitars will this even work on a string bass after all that s more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool its function is three fold string winder string cutter peg pullerso no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably priced tool made by d addario the quality lives up to the brand it s solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed it does everything it s supposed to do does it well and is of good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons the winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use i would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening because of this design flaw stars instead of i note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys what i believe is that it is a mistake to sell the bass and standard guitar version on the same page from what i can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the bass guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity it s obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge the one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn t careful the same holds true for needle nose pliers bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they re doing don t get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using any modification tool i suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings to in seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didn t simply start a new listing when redesigning the device this is not the greatest product they make but it works quickly and makes the string spread when needed to do so more easily than most i own three of these and have them attached to the back of my headstocks great idea great concept and great quality only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that i have recently adopted dunlop jazz iii the dunlop max grip jazz iiis and my dava jazz picks just won t stay in there without slipping out for regular sized picks it s a perfect product for smaller sized picks i improvise by using sd card cases perfect fit for jazz picks what can i say about a guitar strap it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price great item sturdy had it for a few weeks now small light durable holds the strings down perfectly too great capo planet waves signature guitar picks always the best always reliable an excellent useful product that i not only use myself but often give as gifts to other musicians michael haller captain soul s sound circus
667	pop filter works great this really eliminated many subtle flaws i had with audio recording granted you can make a make shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon but the adjustable clamp is really well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations plus although it is flexible it is also very sturdy so don t worry about and vibration noises coming from this i like purple and it is purple the strap is sturdy it works what else needs to be said it arrived timely is decent quality and a nice color surprised really for the price i dont think i could have done better nice case come with stand adapters and make me sound pretty good and i cant really sing dropped one a few times and its still working good feel weight on off switches on each i record to daw and the recordings sound fine i usually run everything through a bbe so that might be part of why i am pleased with them but i do recocmmend these for mics in this price range this was a terrific deal my son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic so i decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great it s always been a problem trying to keep the desk microphone in one place promblem resolved by purchasing this stand my heavy shure stays in one place the only thing is i wish the flex was a little longer about three inches would be great but otherwise a wise and good purchase
668	first off let s get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the dr on the epiphone web site length bout length lower bout thickness lower bout width so now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it the only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the length most bags are you can always opt for the epiphone hard case edread or world tour rwg d or gba the bag i got now that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the review as my title says the guitar reminds me of my samick st which is a very well made spruce top acoustic which is also made in indonesia i have played guitar for over years so i have a collection of over guitars and of them are acoustics but this is the first string and i bought it just to have it around for songs like hotel california etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar i would rarely use i am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under asking price it tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out you constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure the bridge plate on these strings must be huge i found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you don t hit the large one right next to it i have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which i like the nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of that the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out i have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one i have is the later although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal i was recording in an hour had the software on my mac talking to it it sounds great with little of it s own noise the percussion loops are fine at least provide solid guides for recording i have a gnx that i love as far as this pedal goes i am just as happy i echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over fiddling with the small knobs update the software works well is very useful it loaded right up with no problem memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once i start using the pedal more often that s the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal more than worth it though i ve had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone right out of the box the hd totally blew me away i know their marketing calls it hd because of the added tonal characteristics and it s true there is a huge difference between the hd series and the older pods i can t really say why they sound better but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older pods without much tweaking and no eqing although one can tweak the tone with several eqs one complaint with the older pods that i agree with was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone this is not the case with the hd i ve been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work at first i purchased theline pod hd because i didn t see the value of the hd after thinking about it i decided to pick up the hd and compare the two pedals i definitely think the hd is worth the extra cash even for a hobbyist such as myself there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time the wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the s i could be wrong but i do remember them being different the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd are amazing i m sure i m forgetting some differences but i know i m happy that i went with the hd over the hd the drivers seem to work great on both windows pro bit and mac os they have bit mac drivers now the included software is ok i get the feeling they are still building it out it s a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part the software updater works great and i ve already had a couple of firmware updates since i purchased the hd bug fixes there is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct tube amp feel and behavior i nearly purchased the m to plug into myfender super champ xd electric guitar amplifier but i noticed the hd had the same number of effects plus amp modelling for the same price i know the two pedals are designed for different purposes but for me the hd made much more sense i can use it to practice with headphones or plug into my amp as an effects pedal to use it as an effects only pedal one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup i also decided to test playing the hd directly into abehringer eurolive b d active watt way pa speaker system with inch woofer and inch compression driver which may replace my other amps as my primary rig i get the behringer today so we ll see the build quality over the pod x live has improved the case is now entirely metal vs a combination of metal and plastic i can definitely see this being heavy road gig worthy i also purchased agator gk compact keyboard gig bag which fits the hd albeit very snugly overall i m very happy with this setup and recommend this amp modeler effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home especially with headphones on a wide variety of musical styles works very well and is almost hidden on the guitar it is one of those things that once you have it the other ones that stick out seem poorly designed this one will stay on my guitar the others i always took off once it tune as they look so awkward i bought the special pro pack keys g a c love them was using cheep pidmont blues harps toys i had to have more like an addiction i bought a d then this bb then e won t be long i ll get a f this harp bb has a beautiful tone always loved the sound of the bb made in germany quality musical instrument not a toy if you own special s then you already know how good they are if you don t try one you might end up with like me or more in no time worth every cent if they are good enough for john popper bob dylan they re good enough for me a pleasure to play joe i am primarily an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago a gibson les paul what i am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars most name brand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others a few are actually a notch above the others these nyxls from d addario are definitely in that notch above category i find them easier to play better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others i have tried i plan to stick with them a few comments about each area playability these nyxls bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting left hand than do most of the others of course i have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time most electric guitarists who i know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly i prefer a blend of both just as i do for my acoustic instruments these nyxls provide the closest blend that i have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics andtuning tuning and re tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction even some really good sounding strings don t hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used less time tuning more good time playing all in all i found no flaw in these strings there is always something new coming along and d addario s formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them
669	i love the idea that you don t need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick further it will not add something else to find loose in my pants pocket pretty flexible due to the mm thickness i would recommend the dunlop max grip picks over these picks the max grips have a much better grip please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i originally purchased these strings because of the gauges i wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around upon installing these strings i can t really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge but maybe it s too small to notice with the naked eye i m not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old daddario strings that they replaced they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new the guitar that i m using them on is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice and smooth overall i m satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings but i don t think i m ready to give up daddarios yet i have a few planet waves products and i can safely recommend them this is no different it works i have no issues with the product if you are looking for a peg winder or any accessory i d recommend you look at planet waves among your research in brands please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help simple enough right works as advertised a great simple idea that i m glad someone put into production for my taste the loop is too long where it wraps around at the headstock nut area so i just tied it up snug i had been using the martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto a plastic button and this is far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off of the button on the martin holder however folks with brand new shiny expensive guitars might want to take note while the nylon lace that wraps around is nice and strong it is fairly rough and abrasive and my experience is that it will very definitely wear at the finish of your git in that area won t rub the finish off or anything to that degree but if you re freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection on your guitar which i am not you will definitely notice the finish rubbed and dulled and even chipped a bit there at points of contact i can think of a million simple solutions to that but that s another story overall great little item the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion it does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but i d keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner if you value your guitar not a specific knock on the hercules but most low and portable stands like this are the same they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down you may be careful around it but it s hard to say for others nearby for a cheap guitar i wouldn t mind using this but for a more expensive guitar no thanks please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help i picked up a couple of these straps one for a les paul and one for a bass anyone who s ever played a les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a must have this one fits the bill the end pieces are thick with a peg hole that just fits not so small you have to cut and not so large you re worried about the guitar slipping out the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable it doesn t scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesn t grab your shirt so badly can t complain good strap at a good price these are a little flubby thick and soft for my taste in guitar picks but they mellow out the tinny sound of my mandolin beautifully the textured grip surface is great
670	this little stand collapses and sets up so easy holds my guitar perfectly may buy one for my dad next i use this all the time it s pretty basic but really good for a beginner not all chords are in here but the core chords are worth the price i really like this thumb pick the only thing i dispute is that this may be a large for a girl but no way is it a large for a man i think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably so ladies this is a good purchase not so much for a guy works great right out of the box easy to use and accurate a must have for any guitar player turn it on clip it on and tune right out of the box playable i did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime the electronics are just fine on the guitar i got i did have to adjust the string action down a bit but hey that goes with the territory there were some minor flaws in the finish but for the money spent this is a real workhorse and plays great great gig bag for acoustic guitar very well made with good padding it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps it fits the guitar nicely i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag the strap and picks were an added bonus a great value
671	kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but i only use it for walking around the house strumming when i am playing my secondary guitars it s fine for the price this is a very good and stable stand light strong and very balanced it makes my guitar feel secure it is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me good deal will order again came on time works very good strong spring that good start if needed i would buy another for me and my son it works great
672	this amp plug is great for the price its ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price the build quality could be better ideally the nut needs to be replaced the cut is a rush job and the neck needs to be reset there s a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn t completely cleaned out when it was put on but what do you expect for this price it is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you re willing to invest another or so it can be a great starter guitar for a young smaller player or a nice travel instrument i used this on my bass which up until recently i was trying to tune by ear i had it close but it s the fine tuning that really helps this tuner really opened my eyes to how much even being a little bit off can change the sound i am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one but the tuner was a snap to figure out and i had my bass tuned in less than a half hour these are great they re small light weight easy to read accurate inexpensive this one offers an additional feature tap tempo metronome this will work with my daughter s ipod touch generation however the garage band app is for ios and hers is an ios and will not update to so though she can t use garage band there are others that are supposed to work she downloaded the ampkit app and it works great with her ipod and the apogee jam here is a list of other apps that are supposed to work with the apogee jam ampkitamplitube version or greater amps cabsanytuneapple garagebandaudio deck professionalbias iprorecordereveryday looperfairlight samplerfantastocrats studiominigibson s l m hindenburg field recorderianalyzerimovieirecorder proishred livejamuploopymcdsp retro recordermultitrack dawnano studio trg pad sampling pocketamppocketgkreap dfxriot fxrock prodigy guitarscratchtonessonoma fourtracksonoma guitartonestudio devil guitar amptaylor eqvocalive version or greater voice memosxewton music studio it s a pretty cool idea but the cords are a nuisance most electric guitar players like to stand while playing and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections i was surprised at how small the jam is slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around and it saves on other s ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings especially if you are beginner guitarist overall pretty good and very simple to operate just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice my daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do
673	i m a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves what does this add to the others well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo in other words it s freakin perfect so i d give it stars except it gets because that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius full marks you can t miss with this product i have preferred ernie ball extra lights which is a nickel string they have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference the nyxl s have a brighter tone good playing ease and stay in tune better when making new string changes if you have a mahogany body guitar such as the les paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies these are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are pertaining to output i am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in acoustic unamplified output but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears these do stay in tune better than my usual ernie balls nickels when you first put them on the nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch these have their tension adjust better on the first day of use after the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference i find that by lightly sanding the nut with grit paper and using big ben s nut sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other having these nyxl s on there is just one more added benefit i would say if you are looking for a brighter tone with better tuning stability these are the ones to have you can tell from the wall to wall star reviews these are the one to have i m a d addario man myself but hey free is free so i jumped at a chance to try these strings out thus far they have proven durable both in terms of playability and longevity of tone so many other variables to consider when rating strings such as the guitar they go on the gauge of string being used the playing style and climate of the end user etc these are a solid performing string set though i am unlikely to switch allegiances from d addario any time soon still there is no reason to fear trying these elixir s out
674	i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles it s also cheaper like all of dunlop products this worked great it s real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance i m a dunlop fan these are my favorite picks to play with the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness they are also a bit pointier than regular picks and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery the compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons school or a gig works well the cradle guitar stand was for a friend he was happy with the cradle guitar stand hasn t had any problems with it
675	this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length about the same tension as s on a strat so don t want s and s too tight then s it is nice strings tc makes very high quality pedals and this thing is built like a tank i ve had it for over years and done many gigs and a couple tours and all my tc pedals are in perfect condition now for tone this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when i m leading worship n my band we play heavier music so i was messing around with this overdrive so i could use it there as well and i discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal it makes your tone really muddy but if you send a dirty tone overdrive or light distortion into it it screams beautifully i have checked this amp out twice once with an orange ppc and once with the version with both a strat and a les paul and i am very disappointed in this amp now admittedly with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones so without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing bottom line unless you want full on distortion of the time you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp if you are committed to orange and boy do they make some stunning amps go check out the dark terror first of all its huge no like really huge but finally you get over that but seriously its huge the three presets are what sets this apart but this could have been so very much better why the midi clock sync implementation is flawed a the midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on off b to have a midi in and not be able to midi sync quantize the looper sigh like really this means you cant play with a drum machine sampler sequencer or play with anyone that does so while this offers some functionality above the flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays only one of which can be used at a time and can be used as a basic looper along with the delay defined by the knobs the downside is a very large footprint therefore buy if you have the space and either need the three presets or have neither a looper or a delay consider passing if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision both are weak after the fact implementations
676	i ve been using a one spot to power a gator small pedalboard for about years now in that time i ve done probably over gigs and i ve never had a problem is it super quiet no but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups there will be noise it s a fact of life i ve never found it to be excessive turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you re not playing i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard i mix and master all my own music on these guys before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen i cant have giant krk monitors blasting in my small apartment but what i can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light these are not beats by dre they will not make all your songs have super bass and they aren t a great fashion statement however they are work horses and will show you how your music really sounds nicer headphones exist true but these are the best in their price range in my opinion this behringer unit has all the necessary features to give you solid performance in a stompbox delay pedal i say why pay more still glad i have it would prefer to exchange a slightly larger package for full size keys and the action is a little weak less than synth action but it works great weighs almost nothing and is ultra portable i got these recently a local music shop was wanting per stand so couldn t believe the price of these was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised great quality an very robust
677	these screws are not a shiny chrome so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black fender strat body they are good quality screws not a lot of moving parts on this piece lol its a simple piece to attach to your strat body bought these for my squire strat i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips these nobs fit great and look great i would difenantly recomend them i am self taught guitar for about months without this i would be lost i work with a guy who has played guitar for years he tunes it to itself when i had him try my tuner he found that his guitar was tuned to itself yet so far off for you cant beat this don t be so cheap buy this and enjoy it my studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs i purchased several of these cables at varying lengths and found them quite acceptable for this application i m not sure i d put them in my remote recording kit they re not really heavy duty but for speakers or other static applications they re just fine these are great strings and were my favorite until i found fender pure nickel strings some may like the sound of these some may like the pure nickel
678	bought this for my dot it fits snugly and is adequately padded the outer material is strong so i feel comfortable carrying and storing my guitar in it a must if your already paying so much more for the guitar that will go in it a bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews plugging it in and playing it for minutes one can see it has tons of gain on tap it responds well to the guitars volume knob it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love the pedal cuts through and is articulate it s not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock think ac dc and van halen to metallica it s a classic rock pedal that screams buy it i like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments i run this through a furman pedal board and there is little to no noise for the money this is a good product
679	when i was searching for midi cables for my art x foot controller i came across these hosa ones and they were dollars each as they are now i realize i would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly you must realize that they are only feet as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect i bought these to try them out i have used remo a little then i used to have some aquarian heads and wanted to try evans to see how they are amazing i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them i ve got two other levy s cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they re fantastic i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what i had bought before i suppose it s just easier for theno big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and you re a big guy like me and or you play with the guitar bass around your knees you may not be getting what you thought in any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last although i purchased a lanikai lu ukulele some time ago i have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours despite that i ve been highly impressed with its quality and sound as some reviewers note nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp however that s more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele the lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range the tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well if i were going to be playing gigs i d probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument and i probably would not purchase it without trying it first but for having some fun this is a workable and recommended instrument remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store sticky hands per unitthese are kinda like that but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately x you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed they even work on cymbals if you re looking for a quicker decay the closer to the center or more pads you use the more dramatic the effect you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed if you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them i ve been using them for years and they work amazingly
680	great strap durable and good lookin it works great for me i like this type of strap s simple durable try one these are excellent inexpensive guitar strings they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently for the more casual player these might not be the best choice for the gigging musician there is nothing better than these d addario strings they are light weight have great sound and are inexpensive these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings for the more casual musician somebody that isn t changing their strings once a week these are probably not a great choice personally i use elixir strings on my electric guitars a les paul standard and a gibson lucille i do not play gigs so a set of strings doesn t see an hour or two of really hard playing per night the coating on elixir s helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers i like their feel a bit better than these strings i get about a month of playing from those strings sadly these d addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing i ve tried a variety of strings ernie ball elixir and d addario on my guitars and the way i play the elixir s just sound and play the best to me of course your mileage may vary if i did start to play gigs i would probably switch to a more affordable string like these a silly cosmetic thing i hate the packaging of these strings d addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products the strings come in a cardstock outer box with a single plastic package inside each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge i change strings myself and i really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings with the gauge clearly printed on the package if you are new to changing strings or only change them infrequently this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you especially at first i preferred to work with one string at a time d addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic i kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started they could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary in the end the silly colored balls at the end of the strings well they look goofy on my guitars i wouldn t mind the colors on an acoustic the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway but those balls are visible on my electric guitar i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings these strings last days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch ernie ball strings are garbage the only time i will buy these is if it s the only thing available most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than days out of a set of strings touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh you can spend for a set of ernie ball or d addario every days or you can spend for a set of dr strings and change them once a month or you can spend for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every months it doesn t make sense to use these crappy ernie s unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars if your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise interference i installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music no more hum noise crackling etc overall this was an excellent buy
681	durable yet lightweight and sturdy and the price is right pacific hardware is excellent right up there with tama i would buy this again any size wuhan china sounds great this little inch model is high pitched but has that trashy wuhan sound i prefer wuhan to any zildjian paiste or sabian china very comfortable bench it s wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use it feels heavy duty and stays still during use mid level quality the shoulder strap tends to move while you play gets the job done but not for the serious guitarist this little unit is packed with great effects for i m very impressed has just about everything you need in a entry level pedal except for a pedal control all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for while this isn t the new break through tech or the rave of the much much higher end mics it does deliver with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response been giggin since the early s and have been hosting an open mic to boot i get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice super affordable microphone it s a charm b b
682	just what i needed for my home studio monitors that sit on the table next to my computer and my daw system was surprised at how many different versions i was sent they all work well thanks heaps i bought this mic after hearing good things about it but i had never tried it it has impressed me quite a bit since then i use it in a small home studio set up along with a presonus firebox and logic pro on a macbook for the price this mic is a very good deal it sounds much better than an audio technica that i had and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic i also got an oktava mk that is a much more expensive mic and that was then sent to be mod ed by michael joly and therefore cost even more and i d say the two mics are very similar i end up using the cad m a lot more because it s less valuable but sounds just as good what else it has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant it sounds particularly great for male vocals in my opinion although i have used it for as a room drum mic i would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point i ve had it for about a month now and it hasn t fallen apart so i guess that s a plus but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore useless thanks to this problem i am only able to use two slots out of twelve it s definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting stay away from this these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too
683	this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne the only issue i have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post not a big deal works like the picture shows hangers adjust to required width of head stock wood finish is nice look on the wall i bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project i can say that it worked amazingly well for this and did an excellent job at recording the bands without any distortion or excessive noise the recorder stores two files at the same time one being a file at your chosen sensitivity and another safety track at a lower level in case there are any clipping issues with your main recording this accounts for quick transients or anything that might cause the recorder to overload and ensures that you will get a good take the microphones can be folded out to extend the stereo field or in to tighten the field in addition you can use external microphones or xlr inputs for professional level input from the soundboard i found that the internal microphones did a wonderful job of reproducing the audience experience and i can t say enough good things about the performance this is an absolutely wonderful recorder bottom line highly recommended while the tascam us audio interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included cubase le software i am not a novice at home recording as i have used many devices from track cassettes to protools setups over the years here is a rundown of my disappointing experience plugged into my ipad using the camera kit usb connector got device not compatible with ipad message too bad but i can still use my art usb interface which works quite well with garageband installed driver on my old g mac running opened garageband got no input message could not evaluate the cubase software as it requires mac os if i get a new computer i will update my review until then i m disappointed these strings are really quite good but i wouldn t call them perfect the unwound strings are not quite as bright as i am accustomed to but they still ring nicely this is the only complaint i have about these strings if the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter these would be star strings as it stands i give them stars not a big knock actually the low end on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm i put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the jumbo aspect of my acoustic the sound is very big full and nice definitely a recommended product stars
684	yes you can tweak it so its less but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable when given a budget for cheap microphones the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one i like the fact that it adds a deeper bassier tone to any voice but it s missing clarity if you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity spend dollars less and get an mxl instead it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case i hooked the up to a cheap art tube mp preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it they agreed that the was clearly superior to the v g that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp some vocalists actually prefer the mxl over a couple of my shure condenser microphones i ve bought a number of these for use on my pedal board they have performed excellent with no failures noise or loss of tone recommmended if you don t mind a molded cable run this into my laptop from a behringer fx mixer windows didnt need to install any drivers it was plug n play reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record i will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting i found that others had the same issue i had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer click recording devices select my uca not internal microphone from the list click properties at the bottom of the sound window select the levels tab and reduce the level to around or to have an equal volume from themixer into windows and reaper until i did that every signal into reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothing i tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problem so far the behringer uca is working great and signal is clean this is a great pedal i bought the extra footswitch to go with it it makes it alot easier to operate does all i need it to do wish it were stereo stores loops doubt i d ever in my lifetime need that many i haven t tried the computer interface yet works perfectly with iphone and ipad the app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed my only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it but it hasn t broke yet and it might never break works perfectly with ear buds with mic controller great idea
685	i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall if you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good tight spacing i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn t be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures so i will have to do new pictures but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack decker bdl av all in one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about minutes i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional looking installation as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shape i do not however recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately edit i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in it took about minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line at any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage no doubt it s not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should first impression of the guitar was terrible i took it out of the box and started to play the neck had a huge bow in it the truss rod was completely loose i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable i m not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn t set up or if that s the way they come if they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised the guitar sounded pretty good the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric action was good upper fret access is really good the guitar stays in tune while playing plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch i expected red paint i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting they are a little small for a roundback is really a no brainer if your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers i love the dunlop formula polish and cleaner it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism i ve used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles this one works almost like a mist it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints i spray it directly on the surface of the guitar and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth after i m done the shine looks glassy and great wow this amp is something else when it arrived i almost didn t realize what it was because it was so big this thing does everything you can set drums record cords over it and then dub in to the already recorded track and solo over it but what s even better is you can attach drums to it a bass to it a mic to it and a guitar to it and have a killer jam session it has more sounds then i had time to comb through at first glance and more features then i know what to do with amazing amplifier
686	the first thing i do when i get a new instrument is put a straplok on it before gigging with it they re easy to install i haven t had one fail on me yet i have straploks on nine instruments right now and i just ordered another for my new bass i can t recommend them highly enough i bought the mm picks i would consider them medium thickness if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness the mm is right for me i really like them wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better to be clear i am quite the newbie guitar player after i managed to break a string on my electric guitar i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself as most guitarists do things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke i just figured it was something i did and wasn t the products fault so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine overall i ve played quite abit with these strings and have yet to break another one pretty good sound quality and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture resistant package to prevent corrosion use it on acoustic and electric always lose them before i ever wear them out i dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker i love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly the tuner picks up vibrations so it doesn t require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar there s just one button so it s idiot proof however the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soon speaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but i hate that they used the cr battery it just doesn t last long and in brazil it s really hard to find this battery at all
687	better than i expect i going to order more very stable easy to assemble and a nice price i wanted to wait till i got another phono preamp before i wrote this review i did get this from amazontc black phono preamplifier switchablei really needed more aux inputs for cd etc but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others i am using a vintage garrard turntable the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp they are tight but do not make good contact and i need to mess with them this problem is gone with the new preamp overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues if you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where it does sound ok other than being a little bright it does do what is supposed to do i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well yes there many banjos and some with more frills there is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely i see no flaws on my banjo i did not have the problem with the th string machine being to tight as others i bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was bucks cheaper with free shipping if i could give it more than stars i would i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either a keeper for sure love the snark sn works well on my bass and does a beautiful job on both acoustic and electric guitars tight tuning and easily used very good product overall not to mention the reasonable price buy it
688	it s a cable no frills tangles pretty easy and due to it s design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should strong and won t tip price is very affordable i own several and have had no trouble with them buy it and you will see nothing fancy about this strap unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end just well made and functional i got this for my grandson s squier by fender size acoustic it doesn t have a strap button at the top end it would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut but i work with leather and i found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand
689	filter works very well and looks professional only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure these are obviously designed for microphones with the shure sm series form factor i use mine for the much heavierblue microphones encore studio grade dynamic performance microphone and this clip holds it right where i adjust it to the threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision machined mine effortlessly mate with anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom black anon stage stands b tripod boom microphone standand amusician s gear die cast mic stand black which are the only stands with which i ve used this clip bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the shure sm and pg and similar or a different brand that uses that form factor then this clip will probably not work also i cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares actually you should do that i am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model i have five or six on hand including a few spares and if i needed more clips this is the one i would purchase i bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well for only it is a steal the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy i have used it with multiple mics such as the audio technica with the samson sp shock mount a rode k a studio projects c and a neumann tlm i have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic i was not going to write a review for this product but i came across another review that stated i purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a at with a sp shockmount mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what i try this is absolutely false the samson sp shock mount works perfectly with this stand as any shock mount or mic would since the threading is a standard size i just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion also almost every shock mount has an adapter in the mount where the shock mount connects to the mic stand that is slightly smaller than most us mic stands but this comes out all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it from the shock mount after the adapter is out the samson sp will connect to this stand i highly recommend this product be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy other than that an excellent value i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone it matches the mic well color wise and fit the c fits the mount perfectly i recommend this mount highly http www amazon com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable
690	this winder makes changing strings a breeze and i like that there s an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string i also love the part on the end that pulls out the pins from the bridge so this item is three tools in one if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster got a vintage instrument you don t ever want to see hitting the floor well here are is the long term secure solution i would give this stars for the way it works but a page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much something simpler would suffice really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it if you don t mind spending the time to learn all it s capabilities it s great awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere much cheaper online too for the price its a steal
691	the mixer arrived early which was a life saver i immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre amps were used for three vocalists and one flute and the cd input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs i am looking forward to using more of the effects yes you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this trick treat your room with sound deadening works amazingly so far i am definitely proud of this product will be buying more in the future great buy
692	this makes sliding on the bass real smooth it s also nice for cleaning it is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time and it s super easy to apply even though you re not a pro act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play as other reviewers have noted the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to click into the jack of your guitar or amp easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about then the cable is fine other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes
693	look at the price because this thing really sounds good it s no toy it s a real retro electric guitar effects pedal i m very happy with this purchase the regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end my fender excelsior with it s inch speaker rattled the walls of its sweep and can give a very cool effect i notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed also the speed know has a great range with second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones the depth knob does it s job it doesn t have a manual knob to move the sweep but i leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it s no big deal for the price this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my vox modeling amp this pedal is remarkable for useful tones the sound may not be for everyone but i already have a boogie for the really metal like distortion i needed something that was different but still usable and i feel this pedal fills the bill the low price tag didn t hurt my feelings either this is a win win buying decision as far as i am concerned i just received this mic today and tried it out i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers this is a heavy solid high quality mic are you kidding me at this low price they giving it away heck the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and it s worth all by itself i recorded a song today with it and i sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping you can t beat this deal awesome nice mic
694	i use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough i can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound i won t rant about a string winder they aren t that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter i do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but i am not going to be that picky this unit works just fine and i am sure that i will lose it before it breaks its a windscreen this is the first one i have bought but it seems to work how it is supposed to it could be less dense i think idk i use these strings on my practice guitar because the smaller strings are easier on my fingers i can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good bought this to replace my ft mice cable now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want
695	this cable is dirt cheap but the quality seems to be just fine i am using it for my primary rig setup and i can t tell the different between this and some other cables recommended i bought a second pair of these all i gotta say is that they do their job for a good price good stuff this strap is pretty thin not like some of the other for the same price that i have purchased on amazon still does its job but we ll see how the quality is after a while i bought this to tune my string without using the end jack the headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough feel the tone of each string with only minor plucking i use it on chromatic but it includes bass uke and guitar too
696	i love this pop filter it is every to attactch and doesn t scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do the adjustable arm is very flexible yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement whether you re a beginner or have been playing for a long time you can never go wrong with ernie ball strings this mic stand does everything it says it will and is adjustable in every conceivable way in fact the boom has a really nice adjusting lever making it easy to loosen and tighten the only drawback i found is the tripod configuration of its feet making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances especially when you re emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on i would much prefer a round base other than that it makes for a great home garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin it nuff said my buddy used this for a long time so i thought i d give it a try shines up guitars very nice i use it every time i change my strings for a little zaz it does it s job in fantastic fashion but doesn t last the longest the shine will fade soon enough but looks great while it lasts
697	this capo is as good as i ve ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat great deal these are good strings for a good price i have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time i bought one of these a couple of years ago i used it to connect my behringer bcr in midi mode naturally to my computer for mixing duties in reaper it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints a few weeks ago it stopped working i had bent the usb connector and so i thought that was the culprit so i bought another the replacement arrived and installed with no issues but i m still having trouble getting it to send midi data into the computer midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine i m not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky windows update that s happened lately but it s certainly not ideal in my haste having seen it install ok but without trying to actually use it i discarded the packaging unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit so now it looks like i m stuck with two possibly broken usb midi interfaces i have reinstalled windows tried both with another computer uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers all kinds of good stuff and i still can t get either of them to send midi data into the computer i was v e r y close to throwing my behringer unit away as i thought it was broken too thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok this means i just need to get and buy some midi cables and i ll be back in business so i d say buy one of these and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away when they work they re absolutely great and they re so cheap if you receive a lemon return it and order another it s worth it if you re not in a hurry if you are in a hurry then order a few of them or just get something else i d also like to advise people that reports of midi latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer i strongly suspect that the speed of transferring midi data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think and the actual latency you re experiencing is that of converting your midi data into audio this happens inside your computer and has nothing to do with this device s performance it s purely down to your hardware and software configurations all this talk of asio is only really going to help you on the audio side of things if you re using this device to record midi data then you should have no issues at all as long as you get one that works cheers i am a beginner and wanted a set that i can learn on but would also allow me to experiment with other percussion instruments besides a rock drum set and would take a small amount of room and allow low volume levels i ve had this set for about a month and a half so far it is working well for me the rubber drum and cymbal surfaces are great for keeping the volume low enough when playing late at night each drum and cymbal seem to have sweet spots where i imaging the triggers are depending on the devise hitting further from this sweet spot might change the sound and or volume produced the impression i get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another so it seems to be whether the problem s are something you can live with or not also you can t play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that i can enjoy it and feel like i m learning the drums it takes up very little space compared to an acoustic set which is great for me since i have little room for it there are a few problems that i m not likely to encounter until i become really accomplished one is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hi hat or tom simultaneously one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about half the time i found this out when playing these combinations rapidly which i m not likely to do maybe ever but it is still an error in functionality i called alesis and they said this was a common characteristic of this model drum set there is a firmware update that has been mentioned in earlier reviews that i but it didn t make any difference in summary for the price and my needs i am very pleased with this drum set more expensive sets with more sounds and better nuance control don t have the rubber surfaces that i want plus according to reviews they all seem to have problems of some type so spending more money doesn t necessarily eliminate problems
698	great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek glaesel violin ultra practice mute is good tool for your violin if you are afraid to disturb your neighbors when you are practicing violin just buy it it will put the sound down it really works just what i needed to position my guitar while seated i was worried it would not hold the weight but it does well the strings are slightly smaller than the j and deliver a great sound several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try thanks again i have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners they all work fine for me however the snark sn just has the edge it s performance look and feel are great the added features are also a plus i use the snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar it s my go to for chromatic tuner highly recommend this picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while i really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge which gives a warm round sound but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound all you need to do is file down one edge to what you d like and you can have it all great pick i recommend it
699	it works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make shift panty hose pop filter what else is there to say the best deal for recording beginners this mic can handle anything from vocal guitar drum to all the other instruments it s definitely flat and natural sounding which i like just be aware it comes with a plastic shock mount not a metal one like the at comes with however it s usable i own several of these and general buy from gls direct but i needed some quick and had other orders from amazon so i got them hear at same price gls is great quality and durable i use there and cords and have never been disappointed i desperately needed a real audio interface i was tired of my toy behringer i o rca usb thing after reading reviews online this seemed like exactly what i needed it s small lightweight and fits nicely on my desk it s got some solid pre s and has enough for me to work with i didn t need the extra i o enough to break the bank so i is all i wanted i m really pleased with this the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great it handles line and mic inputs just as well and the general rule of thumb sticks here that about o clock on these knobs is a good base level for the pre s phantom power works fine and the direct monitoring switch is really useful i don t like dealing with latency in ableton so to be able to just monitor directly when i m playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great and the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other all in all i d say the design of this is very user friendly some people reported driver issues with this and i can t say i ve really had any problems i m using windows and i have to suggest using the asio drivers whenever possible i had some issues with itunes where the audio would just stop and the level in the windows sound menu was frozen at whatever had been playing all i had to do was disable and re enable in the device but that got kind of annoying i e mailed focusrite about it and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me but the problem kind of faded away so i never really figured out what that was i started using fubar because it supports asio and i haven t had any issues with any program that uses an asio driver i have since started using itunes again as well still much easier to manage the library in there and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then so who knows
700	what a great multipurpose guitar tool it works great i really like the fact that it is cutter a winder and a pin remover all in one the quality is really nice next time i place an order i m going to get another one as a spare i d be lost without this tool i ve been playing over years and got one of these for my year old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does for it s an ok starter guitar for a kid and i guess really short people who can t play a regular fender but not something i d recommend to anyone else and my kid thinks it looks cool so he ll be more likely to stick with it even though it has a laminated body the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood the frets are crowned ok but have some sharp ends to them and i feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed it s light and easy to handle the hardware isn t bad with a stable bridge good idea not to put a floating trem in this way blade switch solid jack and strap anchors and smooth knobs the pickups are not top notch but work well enough a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does so i m not complaining it has a nice red paint job on the down side besides some sharp fret ends it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be the fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret the nut on the one i got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side so the low e string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings it has one small pit in the red finish it has no paperwork or owner s manual the tuners are kind of choppy and the body neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune it comes strung with fender s which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down so it s good for a kid just starting out i actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound but as soon as he gets bigger we ll ditch this for something better these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar i would rather concentrate on making music why fight your guitar bought this for my dot it fits snugly and is adequately padded the outer material is strong so i feel comfortable carrying and storing my guitar in it a must if your already paying so much more for the guitar that will go in it i have many planet waves cables they all work well are well constructed and are a good value i would highly recommend any plant waves cables better than dunlop polish it really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine mine didn t come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though these strings are different and really quite nice the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings i really like them only possible difficulty is that high e etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string i have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my epiphone as well the standard earnie balls i wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features though it s not perfect it s like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps pros amp models cabinet models effects thousands of available presets tones galore good software for managing tones and creating new ones can be used in front of an amp in case you want to know how a modeled mesa boogie would sound coming out of a real vox lots of connectivity compact enough that i keep the unit the cable and the power supply in my case no tech problems at all built in noise gate and tuner easy to use tap feature cons there s a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models manual is a pdf file hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit though you can rename and re arrange them with the software presets based on famous songs don t always sound right minor background hum uses aaa s in a few hours and the manual says don t use rechargables though it doesn t say why for legal reasons the unit uses generic amp names check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they re based on with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy doesn t sound as nice as a good pedal and a marshall half stack no kidding right and i still don t sound like alvin lee as an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp this thing is cool you won t get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it master some of the amp cab models and how to tweak them for gain reverb delay etc before you dive into the presets and once you ve got the presets you like best use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily the line pocket pod pack includes a patch cord power supply usb cable cd cheap ear buds and mp player cable the pack is new so if you re going to buy the power supply then just get the pack if you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it s like new again these are well made good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own will purchase again enjoy i really like this little tuner is is maintenance free small light and easy to use highly recommended for the price i bought this recently for to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades for it s an awesome deal but objectively when compared to an epiphone style case i bought last year for it s deserving of stars which isn t bad just not great pros decent build quality four buckles one locking and three hinges very nice plush lining not heavy knobs on bottom so it stands on end knobs on side and back so it s never directly on the floor fits a dreadnaught well cons not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut the one locking buckle wouldn t stop anyone the big front and back body panels flex more than they should exterior covering feels somewhat cheap the handle is hard plastic and not padded so for it s a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard but it doesn t measure up to a basic epi case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes it also had a strong chemical odor but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away
701	not much to say here strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player you need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style these are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years i replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping times a year the strings are great priced great and was on sale which made it even better there is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that s good too i love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more i m hoping they last a while i like it got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use thanks for getting it to me so fast and i recommend going through the vendor i received this from it works great i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments i love these strings i m a novice and have been using the strings that came with base which were roundwound strings i don t like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes with these flats the sound is gone what more the sound of these strings is a lot more bold and has some awesome tone it s easy to tell what strings are for notes but just in case you have a hard time telling thickness for some reason they are color coded to help with that i can t speak out about other types of strings but i love these over roundwounds in both how they play and the sound i will experiment with other flats over time but i am very happy with these this was a great addition to our studio here at the price was great and quality was awesome highly recommend
702	very very good product i have no complains about it definitely a great buy and a must have in your pedalboard as a pro musician i am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations i had a bad experience with a few compression pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet give up on the thought when i upgraded my pedal board i decided to give the idea of adding a compression unit to give my g l american legacy stratocaster style guitar more sustain at lower volumes boss is the company that dominates my effects board i rely on their chormatic tuner digital delay of them line switch direct box almost every night for gig practice with a somewhat negative attitude going into this i had a great surprise to find that i really really like this unit it did what i wanted then some great tone sustain oozes from this little box stays in the on position for most of the time i am playing my electric guitars especially any stratocaster styled guitar i own if you are playing a guitar that costs several hundreds to several thousand dollars why would anyone buy a cheap guitar strap to hold it up i have friends who think strap locks are the best invention of the century but i believe in buying a quality guitar strap levy s produces some of the best on the market i own several acoustic electric guitars for the most part i have a strap for each one except the pieces too valuable to take to a gig every strap is a levy s i ll call myself a veteran pro guitarist i don t believe in using the word old who gigs about days a month this strap is comfortable to wear strong enough to hold up my gibson les paul standard without any worries of dropping it i ve watched friends band mates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps i offer my advise to buy a quality strap find most continue to use crap straps buy it you will love it i m a professional musician playing times a month this pedal does far more than i need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles i really like the second looping function that s plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative don t forget to order the external power supply i would have happily paid a little extra money to have it included not sure why it s not double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would i haven t had a chance to play with customizing patches etc but i m sure that i ll be pleased with what it has to offer i ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row on a pedaltrain board it s the perfect length and the very slight bit of excess can be zip tied against the pedaltrain leaving a total stealth install since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard jj tubes are the best sounding vacume tubes the only tubes that go into my vintage boutique amps
703	i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great no complaints on a side note i always clean all my cables with caig deoxit gold g spray contact conditioner oz and hightly recommend it to all musicians you will hear the differnce i also spray a q tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it there on the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal right at the upper lip works well for me the bass cut and presence boost are convenient use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids flat s where it s at flat sounds most natural being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might though it takes eq well and you can eq that in if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix so what does it sound like the sound is very natural and true to my voice it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic this thing is heavy and rugged the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one but since my room isn t perfect this will do the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser it really does of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well seriously a db shelf in the highs another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest this rack stand is made up of a heavy steel and welded together very well i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under minutes my audio equipment mounted easily with the included mounting screws and everything looks great and i don t have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over it is very sturdy and very stable i recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to audio or networking devices i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly very useful for acoustic guitars electric and bass if you don t have a pedal board with a tuner this is invaluable to quickly tune up small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case good accuracy compared to my korg pitchblack
704	i had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified then it worked like a charm glad i got them much less hassle tuning up for a gig the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes i don t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound this cable is complete garbage never again
705	put these on my prs se and i love em i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe they were a perfect fit no problems whatsoever now this is one great piece of kit two chanels watts rms real power and super control over the sound of each channel only complaint it s buh tugly sickly brown cheesy looking if she was my prom date i d put a sack over her head yeah well not that i m another george clooney or anything i bought this to use primarily with my newly bought ukulele but it also works perfectly to tune my old acoustic guitar too the display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate i wish i d bought one of these years ago instead of tuning my stringed instruments manually by ear until now i d assumed i tuned my instruments perfectly well but this unit proved me wrong both my uke and guitar sound better after being fine tuned with this this little gadget saves time improves tuning accuracy and is absolutely perfect for the job it is designed for it comes supplied with a cr battery and a basic protective bag to keep it in when not in use i really wanted to like these but they re a frickin lint catching sticky frickin mess they went from my wife s snare back into the holder in a new york minute have never seen the light of day and may have been thrown in the garbage save your money we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now
706	i bought this hoping to use as intended angled into guitar straight into mixer wrong have to use it the other way around sad i have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings within days of installing i play professionally and have a lot of experience installing strings nothing wrong on the guitar hopefully the next set will be better nice for the price practical everyday useable money well spent on this one for sure glad i did it sweet suede the feel of suede is hard to beat this strap fits right feels good and looks handsome levy s is dependable reliable what more thank you all i can say is sometimes you get more than what you paid for while this isn t the new break through tech or the rave of the much much higher end mics it does deliver with a decent mixer you can get a very nice response been giggin since the early s and have been hosting an open mic to boot i get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice super affordable microphone it s a charm b b this is a great stand and highly adjustable can be used seated or standing for a person over feet tall there was a review i read with negative comments about the design claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off nonsense there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock solid because it s lightweight and portable i could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height but this is a great stand
707	i have had them on my loar guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine we will see how long they last i have used elixir for electric and while they do last longer i wish it was a bit longer these strings have great tone and feel they seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time this is a really nice item and i got two of them unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and i had to force it which has created a little wobble that s the problem with mail order sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it oh well so far its working ok with the my old classical beater guitar i have hanging on the faulty one the other unit seems to be rock solid oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar these were the same strings originally strung on my godin seagull and i absolutely love their sound feel and durability the one reason i actually needed them because my g string broke while i was tuning too fast the sound is almost identical to what d addario describes these strings have a great uplifting sound to them hard to soft strums playing feels great with them nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel clean and smooth when replacing i ran into no problems quick and easy i love the strings and their price definitely will stick with this brand as well very good rosin and does exactly what is described a nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows no need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity this is the nd tuner like this that i have purchased it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar the battery lasts a long time as well which is not true with all little tuners like this one all in all i am very happy with this purchase small price to pay to be in tune i would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument wow very cool gadget and well executed this review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks i have not tried it with other stringed or non stringed instruments the thing is quick and accurate the display colors are bright and easy to read it does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing in fact if you play a chord it will usually guess the root note of the chord it clips on easily and firmly it is very sensitive i find that i have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work but i can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune usually without having to pluck it again before i have it right as an added bonus in my case the color happens to be a great match for an epiphone sg g in cherry red snark tuners are great since i ve bought snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way i ve had some for years that i still use today without ever changing batteries or anything they are great and last forever this one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine tune your instrument it have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played really nice piece of equipment for a small price i m a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars i learned a long time ago that guitar like instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung this is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but i also thought the instrument would double as wall art so when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric acoustic uke from hawaii i immediately went shopping for a wall hanger there are more expensive ones out there but this wooden string swing turned out to be perfect easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall call me a satisfied customer jm tepper have used them for years bought some new guitars had to have wish they had something for acoustic electric backplug
708	super low capacitance on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from mogami canare etc the connectors are fantastic and they come with planet waves super handy elastic cord wrap these are outstanding guitar cables at a very good price i used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors but with these i don t see the point the lifetime exchange warranty also makes the diy repair thing kind of pointless too of course amazon s return policy is still days so be aware of that you d need to mail it back to the mfr or take it to another dealer to exchange that is if you ever had to i can t believe these were actually sent to me the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china i am sending them back there is no way i would use these any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost i ve been eyeing these stands for a while always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright i d spent a little money usually here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base now that i finally have one of these i m throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these hercules stands it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well with the extendable neck it can also handle a bass guitar the angle this leans back makes it very stable and when a guitar is hanging on it the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over it holds both electric and acoustics i haven t done any full drop tests but regardless of which guitar i put on it the stand didn t once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitar piece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars and this stand lives up to expectations and does exactly what it s meant to do believe this feet cable is no small thing the jacks are high quality construction very very durable the cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable i plan on enjoying this cable for many many years i m glad i bought it and thanks to amazon who made it available excellent strap for the money the leather is thick and supple in fact the materials are so thick that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup a note about length some might find the standard levy s strap length too short so be aware what you need and note there are xl versions of these for me many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me including those from franklin dunlop bmf wide and mono even the short model was about an inch too long i m a bass player and when standing i prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height a few basses i prefer higher i d suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable measure button hole to button hole and be sure you re ordering the right length the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing sent it back and did not reorder as the title says weeks in and no issues at all it s comfortable and sturdy what else could you want in a guitar strap even though i have a tuner in my pedalboard setup and one on my imac via mainstage the snark is indispensable it s perfect for those times when you don t want to drag out a bunch of gear and just want to noodle around even without an amp i use this little guy for electric guitars and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag if you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button these are great buttons to use it comes with two buttons two washers and screws two different sizes i ve only spent a few hours with it but so far it is fantastic i wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions jams rehearsals and gigs but i also wanted the option of just capturing a line source such as from the di on my bass amp bingo toss in the dual mode overdub phantom power ability to run off usb power and it is a total winner in my book when you select the recording format and encoding or resolution wav bit and resolution mp bit rate etc each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card i also love that it uses full size sd cards microsd can be used with an adapter of course they re much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinky nail sized micros i ll update this review after i ve had some more time with it
709	i use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone it is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place i haven t used this mic much yet but so far it has a great sound it is loud and projects the voice out front of the music for bucks i don t think you can beat it i m happy so far i may buy some more of them it is not too short as one reviewer complained it is a standard length just like the sm later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p a with an xlr jack and phantom power it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u the description on amazon fits the c u not the c so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p a amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a r t having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free i ve ahd this cable pair for more than years and have had no problems with them at all i used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones here are their key points good quality construction secured heads very long cable no signal problems overall great cable buy with confidence i use to protect my microphones of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone very good product i recommend
710	very high quality they look as nice as my fender originals make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue adhesive during installation you want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar hold a tune very well and sound good the seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge but thats ok if you dont wipe them off after playing they wont last long but i always do and i change strings often so that isnt an issue for me overall some of the best strings available v starbugera customer service starslets be realistic this is a very inexpensive tube amp nothing more nothing less its price reflects exactly what it is and thats a good thing and also not so good first off the amp shipped with bad tubes microphonic not a big deal it happens all the time but bugera was no help at all their customer service is by far the worst ive ever dealt with they are clueless arrogant and condescending i bought replacement tubes and solved the issue but thats not the point this experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another bugera behringer product now about the amp itself its ok at best it has no headroom even on the w setting i realize a tiny combo wont have much but this thing has nothing it clips far too easily and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it you will only get a muddy garbled mess clean tones are ok but dont expect fender type cleans they arent there think of marshall cleans or even vox the speaker isnt worth the paper its made from i plugged the amp into a celestion x cab just for comparison and it was a whole lot better its built very well even compared to many amps costing far more if youre looking for a vintage tube amp but either cant afford or cant justify the price of a good one you should try a v im the latter because i only play at home i simply cant justify k or more for a good tube amp the classic overdrive sound of the s is all over this amp if youre looking for a late s s cranked amp stack tone well its here but only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low turn up the preamp and all you ll get is a flat flubby farty unusable tone i love and hate the v though the price is unbeatable its shortcomings no headroom horrid overdrive are hard to live with you sometimes what you pay for and in this case if you want that vintage s tone at bedroom volumes you cant go wrong with the v awesome pedal i love the joyo pedals they don t break the bank and sound awesome glad i bought this pedal does everything you d expect it to do as well as a couple of things you might not like first when run before the amp it adds a bit of treble to the tone and a hint of distortion not to the point of being unusable but you guys playing with the fender clean tone might notice i certainly did playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable as you would imagine ive noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop the treble boost distortion isnt there or at least not noticeable in my experience of course ymmv those are minor complaints though as the pedal works well has more than adequate delay times up to ms and is built well i strongly suggest using this with a v adapter because this pedal will eat a v battery in a matter of minutes overall its a great deal no its not as pristine a delay as a carbon copy or boss dd but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals and i doubt anyone but you will notice the difference i put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far no dead cables yet i ve been using them for months or so
711	feels great sounds great there s a little bit of magic in these strings high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound this is my second case from them build good for carry and balance brass color lock that comes with it how much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand first it a great price about the same as a big mac lol second it fits great does exactly what it s supposed to do third now that i use a pick holder i wonder why i never did so before i do have a tendency to break drop or even wear out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency i have some solid heavier weighted stands that stand up to a quick grab of a pick from this holder but when using one of my cheaper lighter tripod style stands i make sure i m careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so i don t pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick great product couldn t live without it lol and it s not the manufacturer s fault i have some cheap light weight stands if you re looking for a pick holder i can t think of any reason not to try this one don t let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you this is an awesome pedal ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound it is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don t abuse it to much it should be fine you can adjust all range of sound and make it yours as the title states i love the sound and i also love the price buy this i ordered just to try it since it was so cheap the first one arrived in non working condition wires inside werent even soldered so i ordered a replacement plugged it in and it didnt work either the second wasnt soldered either i know its cheap but i expected it to at least work do not buy yes i bought and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass very easy to install on the wall its a pop filter it works well and does the job however the neck on this thing is a bit long so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way otherwise its a good option at a good price
712	it s a capo nice fit yet sometimes i wonder if it fits too tightly as when i use it and of course the strings are tighter sometimes i feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight yet it is a capo structured very well daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money exactly as described and very affortable would recommend this to anybody everything i would want in a gig bag a quality bag for a quality instrument what you see is what you get i am very pleased with the quality of this stand it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less it shipped on time and the packing was good so cheap i bought one for each of my ukuleles would never use a pitch pipe again and i guess i might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these my only reluctance about getting this was i thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but i unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does it gets down my guitar tracks in ipad and sounds terrific so the price tag isn t such a big deal no learning curve simply connect the included cable from the jam to your pin ipad dock plug in your guitar pull up garageband select an amp click on the icon in garageband that shows the guitar cable end then select on for monitoring hit record and start jamming man that is all there is to it i ve not been one to record on computers for a long time preferring instead to use such things as fostex track recorders behringer mixers digitech effect pedals etc but this is going to change all that awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use update i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx i discovered that this apogee jam will take the signal routed standard guitar type in cable from the behringer s control out l mono thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs both microphone guitar the sound quality doing this is excellent i ve recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam consequently my opinion of the apogee jam is even higher than it was when i wrote my initial review in march i may not even need that focusrite box now
713	it works really well and it s really thin it s thinner than i thought the price it s about right i needed only of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording practice having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere it works fine it is lightweight and feels sturdy only drawback i tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass and the preamps saturated in low frequencies input has to be kept within a small range kenny wayne shepherd blue on black nail the lead use a strat in the neck position gets close enough to fake it for a club band sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron this pedal will save you or more from the ci model and it s close enough some are concerned with the switches i am running it in an fx loop pedal so it rarely gets the button pushed anymore i have the joyo ultimate od also nice pedal i think i like this little company
714	before bying this product i doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings i received it and the first thing i did is try it it cuts the medal strings like butter i used to use whatever i could find around the house which was a pain because nothing i tried could cut these metal strings the winder i m not going to use but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it i have been a faithful user of d addario strings since a well meaning obsession starter recommended them to me at a local music store compared to other brands of nickel strings that i ve used these ones just feel cleaner than the others they have a clearer sound and seem to hold their tune better than most if you re looking for acoustic strings you can t beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity but if you re looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean look no further
715	i use to use a cloth to clean my strings this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool easy to open clamp on the strings run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer the only thing that i worry about is running the plastic over the frets i understand that it s only plastic but i wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time i don t know if i see an issue i may update this a year or so down the line until then excellent solution i always wanted a boomerang iii looper which at almost was not really a justifiable expense for me then i found this for about and i immediately sprung for it this is a great practice tool all it does is make loops the learning curve is very low and there s no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total minute recording time there are no quirky timing issues to be found here your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops this does take some getting used to but it makes you a much better musician in the process your drummer and bassist will thank you this could possibly even be used as a live performance tool although you d have to be very very proficient with this tool and be playing very very tightly in the pocket i personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this lest something go wrong on stage and lest i subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick students would be especially encouraged to get one of these my playing has definitely grown and improved since i finally broke down and bought a looper
716	makes my guitar look great from the fretboard strings and body everything conditioned and polished great quality product highly recommend i own all versions of this pedal and cherish them if you need more control with eq this pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket more versatile than the sovereign man when i saw these things a light came on in my head it was an uh duh moment no noise plenty of length and nicely spaced with right angle plugs for all your standard v dc pedals any complaints about noise with these cables it just a symptom of something wrong within their setup i had an old wall wart laying around and put it to good use check the total amount of amperage draw usually milliamps to make sure your wall wart can handle it and daisy chain away i purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar this fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my jackson dk i m using springs right know and stay s in tune no matter the abuse the only con on this product is that they are noisy is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing this tuner is great best buy works so well i highly recommend this tuner can t buy a better tuner for less money
717	not a whole lot to say about it quality materials works well love to keep my taylor on it but had to re case the guitar during our low humidity days i bought one of these for a vintage fender showman that doesn t have built in reverb put a battery in and plugged it in very simple but the sound was horrible no setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb i ever heard or would want to hear the closest i could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful on the other hand the reverb from my korg ax g that i was using on another rig was great maybe my dr was not functioning properly but i don t think so i think that s the way it really sounds so i got a return authorization from amazon very easy never fails put it back in the box and ups picked it up the next day and i got a full refund jm tepper for many years i ve been playing with proel and fender cables until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components best of all warranty for life or maybe longer i got this amp recently at a local store and so far im loving it i also aqcuired the mkii foot controller and is a perfect combination tons of sounds and it can be edited to fit your demands nice volume coming out of it also for watts it seems more recommended i use this on my spider iv it works great i ve had it for about months and no issues i was looking for a portable fold up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around found the guardian at amazon and thought for how could i go wrong oops wrong the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely but i found it next to impossible to get my fender jazz bass to stand up in it the lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn t blow this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don t care too much about but for for an electric guitar or bass no way i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support live and learn i m a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars i learned a long time ago that guitar like instruments ought to be hung by the neck as one finds them in a music store to minimize neck warpage and all my instruments are hung this is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele but i also thought the instrument would double as wall art so when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric acoustic uke from hawaii i immediately went shopping for a wall hanger there are more expensive ones out there but this wooden string swing turned out to be perfect easy to install holds the uke perfectly and the whole thing looks great on the wall call me a satisfied customer jm tepper
718	this houses your guitar and i have a couple humidipaks in there because i live in a northern desert not many frills to this bag it does the job terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps this was recommended by a guitar repair shop and i have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand it will polish and lube things like floyd roses do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil wipe them down with a little dr duck s ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case the secret is always use the least you can get away with too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever this system works great i have a taylor ce and two other guitars i use these on very simple and works great it is all preference i prefer the cactus picks these slide around in my finger to much right now to each his own it is all preference i bought a couple cactus picks and i like the fact they stick to my fingers better these are slick and seem harder to keep track of clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar pluck a string and it will indicate what it is turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done takes minutes to tune the guitar mine is electric works plugged in or unplugged the capo is made of metal and works well it does what it is suppose to do i would buy this again i am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar i have learned a few songs but i still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar i wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap i had the dean electric guitars in the past and a fender acoustic a while ago the fender and the dean s were very nice i thought the dean s had a very nice sound to them and so did the fender this guitar has a very nice sound to it as well i couldn t figure out the different tunings on it though it said rhythm and treble and then just regular in the middle i kept it on the regular because it sounded normal the other one s must be for some special type of music but this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the dean s it is also very easy to hold unlike the dean s i have found the dean s also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and i have not found one on this guitar which is a plus but this is a very nice beginner s guitar if your just looking to get started i would stay away from those fender knockoff s and stuff like that and get this guitar i also got the cheap rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes all in all a very nice bargain
719	works well has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options i would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb i ve had this for days and i m so glad i bought it its basically a top end second delay with whistles and bells you wouldn t even think they would be on there i have had alot of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the second loop capabilities from the product description i expected something far more robust than this unit by and large i ve had great experiences with behringer pedals but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in years of playing no stronger than the reverb in a w first act amplifier if all you want is amp like vibrato and chorus here ya go and it s cheap and cool looking bigger footprint than a boss pedal the hue control gently affects the tone this is the best octaver i have ever played through i bought my first one in and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive three umm density timbral tonal choices chorused only octaved signal mix clean octaved signal per setting which ranges from to octaves quiet and tiny footprint you d be dumb not to get one while they re cheap
720	i have had several mxr pedals through the years i have always found their quality to be very good for the price in fact some of their pedals exceed the competitors products for less than half the price to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesn t mean it is that much better if you need a little tone sweetener this pedal can deliver with flatter eq s it is fairly noiseless but as with all eq s if you boost certain frequencies pretty high you will get some noise simple to use and i particularly like the lighted leds for each band this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage as with all mxr pedals it is built solid and road rugged for the price this is a nice pedal simple to use and built to last solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag there isn t really much in the way of instructions but the leds are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out i wanted to use these cables for my acoustic electric guitar they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though they seem to be built well but i d say in comparison to other cables i ve used for my applicaiton the sound is average these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most if you are a performing musician you would do better to look at higher quality cables for best sound quality and lowest noise this is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board i like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking i find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle i don t use it much with single coils since they don t seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone built solid a quality pedal that should hold up well i am a long time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments wanted to like this but first the positives looks great nice easy to read display the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs the clip seems sturdy tuner is compact nice pricenow the significant disappointment inaccuratethe settings were on a but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing the tuning was sharp i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners very disappointing i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price however since d addario now owns planet waves products they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner it has its place i guess but i much prefer the larger one too bad they made this decision imo i haven t settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models bottom line no matter how nice the snark is in many ways the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately not only string to string but to a standard a having failed that requirement it is useless for me especially in a band situation if you are an electric guitar player you know how it is you think you are finished with your pedal board but in a few weeks you are back at it searching for another effect but this means trial and error and a busy wallet the solution may be this zoom ms g this unit is like having stompboxes to use on demand without having to change out your board here are some the things i like most about this pedal small footprint same size as most single stompboxes of today the digital effects are very very good most have an almost analog quality to them ability to create and save your own patches ordering them for stage use good tuner included i found it to be very accurate and easy to use if you already have a tuner then you can open up another slot great price considering effects this thing costs no more than a single stompboxthe unit is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it however i will say it takes some work to get a handle on everything and the manual isn t a great deal of help but with just a little work and resolve you ll be dialing in some new sounds i have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the ms g zoom has a reputation of creating quality effects units at very reasonable prices they ve done it again with this pedal i highly recommend it if you have one slot on your pedal board but don t know which pedal should fill it one thing to note that was frustrating at first most of the od s and distortion s are preset with the levels way too high for output to a tube amp once you put these pedals in your own patches you can permanently save them with appropriate levels just be prepared to cut the levels down right away when trying out od s and distortions or you will likely get some very unpleasant feedback well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars these strings were designed for the new rosewood series guitars that came out this year the promise is a bolder high end fuller low end i am a long time taylor owner and favor their series rosewood spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs i recently picked up an ce first edition fret such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hd s took some getting used to as far as feel due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings e b g but as far as sound they are great the d a low e strings are no different from the regular elixir pb lights so i am not sure about the claim of fuller low end compared to what unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response i am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than taylor s but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings that is what i notice most from the hd s compared to the regular i still find no fault with the regular elixir nanaweb pb s but will most likely continue to run the hd s on my fret i may also try them on my older ce just to see if there is any difference improvement so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain try them out and make your own decision
721	this works fine although the mount is a bit weird to me but i see that most are the same as a pop filter it works perfectly and i was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring just pop filtering through black pantyhose lol use it with an sm shure mic in a studio type application holds up great mic does not slip upside down sideways provides everything i need from a mic stand everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm packs up small i knocked off one star because if you look carefully at the stand it leans ever so slightly it is after all a cheap chinese stand this stand is very nice it is black and it does its job very well it also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand it is like an added bonus
722	while the shure sm lc shure sm vocal microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship the beta a needs to be given its due the beta a is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin that is the beta a in the confined live scenarios in which i have utilized it has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues for vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high or really any notes the beta is a dream this same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or popping complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it while i wish that i had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon i can confidently say that the beta a is the best vocals microphone that i have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment quite honestly i would not be at all surprised if the beta compared well even in confined recording situations the bottom line is that the beta a might be more expensive than its popular cousin the sm but it is worth every penny anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority six out of five stars i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk and the item pictured is nylon i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip i can t remember how many years ago i started using this great stuff like everything else moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time i play i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot i believe its the older metal version of this not the lite however this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner on a martin jumbo acoustic it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too i m not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one it doesn t seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw i wouldn t recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use if you are looking for the screw down style i would look for the older version of this and avoid the lite i decided to try out the m in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board while i haven t explored all of the sounds yet i have found some useable ones you really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation also factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much here are some that i ve personally found to be appealing so far delay analog w mod a nice sounding memory man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalreverb room standard adjustable digital delay not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicenvelope filter tron up a winner fully functional and authentic envelope follower funky synthy seeker a very cool filter for single guitar notes octave bass octaver one note below only but quite effective especially for loopers you will also find as expected with a multi effects pedal many unpractical downright silly sounding noise makers not to say you won t find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we re talking about a headphones session also don t depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you re using it as an addition to your amp s lead channel construction seems pretty sturdy other than the model select button which is a multi use knob with push down turn action and is cheapy cheap it s awkward and uncomfortable to use fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up i already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets having the choice between true bypass and dsp is a really nice touch and unheard of on stomp boxes as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain the tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position i do miss my korg pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection i personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually the m is serving that purpose the sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist they should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package what a fantastic product i believe i have been wishing for this for years only one problem make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot no longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal board i have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is t u f f i you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product still holding strong building another board and using this stuff it s much better than regular velcro i don t have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away this clip on tuner by snark is fantastic works great it alows you to fine tune each string buy it
723	these are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are they are so tuneful they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful my only concern is that if the strings aren t wound properly they seem brittle and break e g low e and a strings and the vulnerable g string the light version i find are particularly suited to finger picking as a professional guitar player i am always nervous playing a show with old strings however i ve been using elixir for over years now and the strings really do last a long time i would usually replace my strings every month but i ve started leaving them on for up to months it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt i don t use it for feedback i use it to protect it from the dust it fits tight but it s fine i have four snarks and one other brand the snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display tuning is quick and simple i have other capos and decided to try this one and i have to say i love it i have used the kyser spelling for years as my favorite and that is a good capo but i will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz i will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up but i love it so far i use it on my taylor ce taylor e and my epiphone anniv accoustic
724	i ve been using these strings on my guitars for the last years they always give me consistent results i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there i ve purchased many of these cables and i ll be getting more eventually cables even good ones eventually break these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name if you need cables these work great against most educated and experienced advice from many blogs i installed one of these in my twin reverb watt the original speakers are too hi fi sounding for me they hurt my ears so clean this speaker has all the range and a little bonus sizzle to boot but in a round full musical way again to those who may like to tread in my ill advised path these are watt speakers the twin reverb is watts right now i have the cr and one original speaker running in my tr i ll get another cr if this one holds up okay but i m in a band that plays small rooms a lot so i dont crank it past very often i ll post an update if this speaker fails but at least on an initial run i m glad i bought it rock and roll forever having purchased many a frame and more traditional style stands this one has quickly become my favorite not only is the padding much better than the rest of them this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work only thing lacking a bit is the instructions but it s easy enough to put together that they aren t really needed i ll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon
725	i purchased this when it was on sale during the christmas season i figured that for the asking price at the time i could not go wrong my expectations were frankly low i had heard nothing but horrible things about epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability what i received was the polar opposite i received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when i unboxed it i am not wild about the strings that came stock but i am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums i guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads in the near future i intend to restring the guitar withd addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar strings light which while thick should make the instrument jazz friendly i realize that flatwound strings will require a new set up and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investment out of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared to my novice eyes and fingers to be properly dressed i have already invested in a good but not great case guardian hardshell electric guitar caseto store the guitar i also uploaded a customer provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits for the record i use the following amp which i have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar kustom defender watt class a guitar headthat i run through akustom the defender x guitar extension cabinet for h head bottom line this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players the price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year nothing special just like every other strap of its kind i compared it to other poly straps i have and it s ok no better and no worse price was good it took a long time to come leather ends seem ok i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint i m using it as a spare so it should be ok i m a little disappointed i m used to a higher quality from eb products it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone i don t perform a lot of antics on stage it s just me and the axe i don t expect any problems hope this helps small thumbs up to amazon i ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams but alas i was wrong the winding apparatus works beautifully but the cutter doesn t allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference so i m back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post all in all a good product to have if you don t have pliers on hand or don t mind getting a closer snip i cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn t have pegs luckily the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge which i think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place each to their own i suppose it s oil what more do you want turn upside down squeeze hard use your man level strength and soon the tip will darken apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth it s okay to soak the wood as long as it s momentary don t saturate the fretboard and walk away wood absorbs oil too much oil absorbed fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling losing shape and flatness not a good situation lemon oil isn t like other oils it isn t very slippery and kind of makes things grabby it s oil but it actually works more like a solvent cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean like your frets hint hint just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re string and you ll be a happy camper i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well i like s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the power slinky name love these things i feel a little guilty because i put a pair on my epiphone les paul plus top i also have them on my fender marauder and now i can easily swap straps between guitars and i m secure in the knowledge it s not going to land on my foot yeah you could put one of those plastic dunlop pick looking things on a regular strap to keep it in place but these look and feel so much cooler they use a quick connect of the kind found in natural gas and compressed air connectors pull up on the locking ring slide it on and release
726	i am not a studio engineer nor am i a professional musician i record songs in my home as a hobby i like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting so if you re at or around the same level you know what i m talking about will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much no are you likely to find it in a high end professional studio eh probably not is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point hells yes i ve worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious and this is the nicest mic i own right now the difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious i use it for recording vocals and my voice again not a pro is finicky to record usually sounding pretty muddy even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals sm and this was still the case but with this mic my voice sounds much more clear and open admittedly this is a very subjective evaluation but then aren t all mic evaluations subjective you can go on all day about response range and eq flatness but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application and to my ears this mic sounds wonderful my only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn t seem to be a super tight cardioid because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it perhaps this is how it s supposed to be but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously it can be a headache trying to jury rig an isolation method that works i took off a star for this alone although that may not be fair since i haven t used any other large diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they re all supposed to behave this way i used this for a while but now i have the behringer ch rack mount and this rarely gets used also every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp i still use this for practice at home its pretty delayed and doesn t display the notes for very long but i play in drop g and it gets the job done the construction isn t something i wanna step on but in a bag its better than paying my experience with this little tuner has been perfect it s extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment it s dead quiet when activated easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you re tuning takes up very little room on a pedal board the cream on the coffee is that it s under a hundred bucks that s crazy for the build quality it s a little iron bricki highly recommend this little guy korg got it right on this one this pedal is awesome i use it the most of all my pedals because it s pretty much perfect i can get completely different sounds out of it it s also true bypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off it s much smaller than the big muff pi which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal it is a fuzz pedal so don t buy it expecting overdrive also when it s turned on you will hear a hum but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights and muff pedals hum alot none of that makes me dislike the pedal it s one of the hest fuzz pedals ever i use it in front of a wah and that s all i ll ever need to use pedal wise get this pedal
727	hard to believe this was so bad i have a planet waves locking guitar strap which is a dream and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap however it is so thick that it can t really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap and when i tried to lock it the two pieces came apart go with the planet waves lock straps this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while cleans up your gear s appearance tremendously very easy to use and lots of extra cable length i should start by saying that i did not buy this from amazon not that it s a bad price but i got a discount on an open box demo unit at a local guitar center for i ve seen them cheaper for used ones but i wanted a new one with a warranty i am using this amp for an electric violin and for an acoustic violin with a pickup i wanted the cleanest sound with bare bones controls and that s what this little champ provides most of the time i use it with the gain on or and the volume past it s very cool that it has w w and w settings i haven t seen that in any amp in this price range the w setting is perfect for my studio and the w setting is great for using with the headphones jack the w setting can really crank out the volume you could spend about more and get a vox ac series all tube amp that s another amp i was considering i wanted something not too big and portable but could use at home without shredding the walls but the vox doesn t even have reverb like the bugera which has only a single pre amp tube and the vox is w while the bugera boasts w i know if i plugged an electric guitar in and cranked the gain i could get some lovely distortion because i ve tried that with the violin the digital reverb has a spacious feel i love reverb and wouldn t buy an amp without it it seems to be built well and only time will tell if it holds up under daily use which i plan to do when it comes time to change the tube there are many choices for a nice upgrade to something better than the stock bugera tube i ve even read online where people drop in a different speaker but in my opinion the bugera speaker is just fine and sounds like a bigger one all in all i m very pleased i also tried the bugera v all tube amp at the same guitar center but that s way too much amp for me at this time if i were to fill a large hall with sound that would be the way to go the v is sweet i had never heard of bugera until i tried that model and was really impressed another option is to unplug the speaker in the v yes the speaker has a plug and a jack and drive another speaker cabinet which bugera also makes you can use any speaker cabinet i guess that has a minimum of ohms which is clearly written near the jack the bugera v is perfect for me and i wouldn t go down to the smaller bugera bc i think bugera has hit the nail on the head with quality and value and i ll be looking into other products made by bugera behringer music group the seem to be all the same company people say its an ocd clone it sounds very similar i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges but its a very subtle thing all in all i m happy with it knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones good pedal to add the only reason i give this instead of stars is that i ve noticed it s response is a little less than the original bulky snark sn i must admit i haven t checked out a new battery as with my original snark a new battery made a big difference but the size is something that cannot be beat the original snark is a little ungainly and this tuner really fits beautifully on my strat i have a boss tu stompbox tuner and am thinking of freeing up my pedal board real estate and using this instead overall this is a definite buy
728	cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster this is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way it is very safe for guitar finishes these tubes just aren t for me they don t sound great kind of flat and lifeless also unreliable one out of arrived doa and another has failed since
729	i bought these strings to try on my guitars they sound good on a variety of models like sg les paul rickenbacker they have a melodic tone and good intonation and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape great product accurate small functional inexpensive better battery life to previous generations very good quality adapts easily to any type of guitar heads small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little i wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my sony and korg plug in tuners it clips onto the guitar easily stays put and is not intrusive by weight or size the bars are easy to see and are accurate this is one of the nicer capo s ive used certainly superior to the old school band based jobs from yesteryear one of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab position release and go heck you could probably place it mid song if you were so inclined to do so also it clamps without bending the strings i ve used it on my start les paul and martin all with no complaints i hardly ever use a capo but if i need one i am glad to have this one i ve used elixirs for about five years now this set offers the same great sound for my acoustic as their electric strings provide for my electric some people don t like the polymer nanoweb that coats the string but i find that it cuts back on string noise sliding your fingers around doesn t cause too much noise and with acoustic strings i find that very important especially if you re using a piezo pickup in your instrument phosphor bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars imho these are great strings worth the money and sound great they also last times longer than regular non coated strings in my experience been playing for yrs great product
730	this is such a nice bag for the price nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever there is a handle and a shoulder strap plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front this is a great stand it looks the same as any other but it works great for about dollars i was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that i need a humidifier for my guitar at first i was not sure what i was looking for i found the product without too much difficulty i had learned from my instructor that these are small placed on the hole of the guitar and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition i started looking through the computer pages and settled on the herco guitar humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product now i feel i made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations and good music this strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good also doesn t fit an instrument where there s no place to hook it i returned mine as it just didn t fit well for my uke or mandolin it s very small it s a fabric stretchy capo the old type that s quite difficult to stretch and make stay it s made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo but the end isn t very long and i don t trust it to stay while playing for long i ll keep it as a spare just in case anyway i was very skeptical about this mic being so cheap and all but i use it in my band with several other shure mics and i cant tell the difference the same pa mix and they sound the same i plan on getting a few more of these these stay connected but aren t so wide that they change the style of picking i like them and so does my music teacher we try to stay stocked in these picks i bought this to replace my blue snowball because i ve reached that point where i require something that sounds a little bit more professional than what i was using before i begin my review i d like to mention that i use this with a behringer usb premium input mixer with xenyx preamp copy and paste that into amazon s search to find it so my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing okay my pros and cons pros my voice sounds great with this thing before i was using a snowball and my podcast partner told me it sounded like i was in a chamber with this my voice is strong and clear and even a little bassy which is nice because i don t have a naturally bassy voice i m extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound it is worlds better than usb mics like the blue snowball worlds better it s heft heavy and feels well made this might be the most expensive feeling device i own it s heavy but it in a good way the materials feel high quality this feels like a professional microphone it comes with a mic stand holder thing never say no to free stuff cons the only thing i can think of is that it doesn t come with its own cable you ll need to buy an xlr cable on your own it s not bad enough to deduct a star there are people who are comparing this to the shure sm and other microphones here s the thing i am an amateur before i owned this mic i was using a blue snowball and before that my laptop webcam mic so i am not the authority all i can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing my podcast co host immediately noticed the difference and couldn t tell me enough of how much better i sounded and that s over a skype call we podcast using skype so if you re looking for a vocal podcast mic this is a great cheap option are there better options sure but not for this price not even close recommended wholeheartedly nice bright light i have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about years as with many things i m a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music this light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything the switch is conveniently located on top of the light the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move unlike my twin lights some items of gls work great others are awful don t trust the products anymore it s unfortunate but i don t feel safe with their products that they ll perform when i need them to just recieved my stand it fits the mandolin perfect it also fits my wifes ukelele so i ordered a second one this morning its made very well is compact once its folded up the price was awesome i totaly recomend this stand for anyone that has a small stringed insterment thank you so much i bought one of snark s super tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised it will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio and one on my stage rig buy it it s a great little tuner i have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps this fits just right and looks just right it s well made and not too expensive i just wish i had found them before buying all those guitar straps works very smoothly and doesn t eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners we have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a pack for yep a buck i m sold on these and will be getting another as soon as i need one i ve used a variety of tuners when the snark first came out the price was so low i thought it must not be that good however i borrowed one one time and ended up buying several what i like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display is seems to be very accurate the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough i have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners about the only thing that has been an issue is that on occation it won t register turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem also it may be a litle larger than some like
731	nothing fancy its plastic but the quality is by no means bad it serves its purpose and is simple which i cannot complain about if you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about digitech effects pedals they ll tell you to stay away from them except for this one that s because the digitech bad monkey tube overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by boss or the ts tubescreamer in fact the ts tubescreamer is the pedal the bad monkey is best compared to this is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock but since the pedal works well as a level gain boost i ve heard of guitarists turning on the bad monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects to really push them to new levels but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the two band eq virtually any distortion pedal has a tone control that will make the tone darker or brighter but since one band eq basically takes away bass to add treble or vice versa you may not find the sound you want that s what s so great about the bad monkey if you feel like your tone is too weak you can fatten it up if it s too muddy you can add treble and you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like construction is extremely durable die cast metal and probably heavier than a boss pedal the switch is more similar to a boss than an ibanez pedal but i find that easier to use if you re a beginning player or a player on a budget this would be an outstanding pedal to own along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal there s really no need to spend the extra money on a tubescreamer if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear but even for player where money is not an object don t overlook the bad monkey it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you ll need i use this as the first pedal that my guitar cable touches as it goes into the pedal board it s true bypass which means that the sound is not affected when it s not in use when you step on the button the sound cuts out and you get the tuner it works as advertised my only complaint is that it could be smaller there are other smaller true bypass tuners out there if space is an issue on your board i ve posted a photo of this tuner on my board pedaltrain mini with soft case if you need a smaller tuner i have buddies who use and like the polytune i admit i haven t had it long but so far so good i have a gator pedal board that came with their power supply unfortunately that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable the ps is fine but the cable is shorting out couldn t find another cable so i thought i d find another solution with a more generic cable this joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition which made me a little skeptical i may never need all its features but for what i need powering devices it is doing the job beautifully my pedal board includes tuner chorus and octaver stomp boxes a bass di and a rolls headphone amp the jp frees me up from any other wall warts money now i just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board
732	alright for the past years i ve been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string and let me tell you doing this process on guitars sucks this tool is awesome it takes about minutes to change strings now and it s well made and durable the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine i ts not perfect but neither am i so stars would recommend to anyone this is an ok solution to keeping your picks handy and organized at least you can have one place where you can find a pick as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case but a small baggie will work just as well maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage sometimes depending on the amount and size of the pick it s hard to get the pick out of the holder and if you use something other than the standard shape forget it it has an adhesive backing so i guess you can stick it on your amp guitar wall small animal but i d rather not well here s what i have to say this strap is much shorter than im used to but seeing how i bought this for an off guitar that s ok they really should put the length in the description the length is max where i like my straps to be max it is a hard strap to get on the guitar i do not suggest getting this strap withdunlop dual design straplok system nickel these are great locks but almost impossible to install on this strap overall great buy for a cheap little money saver it does exactly what it says it does my only complaint is i wish it could go a notch or two lower but very pleased it s cheap and works like a champ works right out of the box easy to read easy to use arrived very fast inexcellent shape just had to put the supplied battery into it
733	long wait for overpriced item arrived on time but there was a week wait overpriced but was expected as fender name on product tuner works well with acoustic but not so great when your electric is not plugged in seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit and it s okay i also have the ns micro and that s a better tuner what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss my guitar i guess but who cares i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else a question to amazon companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn t be prosecuted p s i think it is too polluting for low cost items to waste again in paper box transportation restocking work refund work and so on this is why of the time i do not ask for my money back but sell this lemon on amazon online with other websites and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith while testing nobody in irig noticed the overwhelming hisssssssing well that is beyond me when i m in a apt i need an amp with tube at least the pre and a cabinetorange ppc x speaker cabinetas small as possible giving a decent sound and output w o annoying around and orange made my needs true i never ever expect to play at a stadium with this obviously in my opinion this is absolutely a decent amp that respond to precise needs
734	i kinda strayed away from the elixir brand for a little while just to see if another brand would sound better and in doing so i wasted time and money but i did get some experience i m back with the elixirs now and have no intentions to experiment any more simply put elixir makes the best strings for an acoustic guitar that i ve tried and i will stick with them because they have great sound last a long time easy to clean and prevent rust and or corrosion the benefit of coated strings is as the box says longer life this is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural life i e that brightness that new strings have the drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings so are these any good yes they feel great not overly slippery or coated and sound great though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings i m excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player i change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer about gauge these light strings go from to as compared to my old martin s which went from to in summary d addario makes good strings and these are no exception if you re looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted as opposed to aggresive tone with lighter low e then you should check these out this new type and design of capos manufactued in england and warranteed for life is truly wonderful available in six and twelve string steel string as well as a new classical version they are all easy to use solidly built and perhaps most importantly easy to put on and take off with one hand without having to retune for a musician this is the most cricial element that and that it is kind to the materials used in the manufacture of a good guitar i use mine on a martin hd and have had no problems whatsoever a great move toward a new generation of capos not cheap but worth every cent a little history i have been a guitar player for forty odd some of them very odd years for the first thirty of them i tuned by ear starting by guessing at what a low e sounded like then tuning the other five strings by fretting listening and tuning i could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord yet remained off for others it took quite a long time to get it right then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out the problem i thought was that my guesses at a true e were off so i got myself an e tuning fork cycles and used it to tune the first string then i did as i had always done fretted and tuned the other five not much better as a result kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right during those years i tried tuning all six strings to what i believed was an accurately tuned piano as well as by ear to tones available online nothing gave me better tuning on the first try then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck the realization there have been many each of which has led me closer to what i have now near perfect tuning on the first go round first off i realized that when we say e that is not just one note it is a range of literally hundreds perhaps even thousands of specific tones the same is true for every note this is akin i guess to the realization as a child that no matter how many shades of blue are in a box of crayons the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare purchasing my first chromatic tuner a ct manufactured by switchmucic and sold through musiciansfriend com moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning however that tuner had at least two limitations firstly it s construction is rather light and flimsy it works ok but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the korg for about the same price that is that the korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you both tuners have plug in for electric instruments and so far as i can tell their accuracies are similar i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned additionally the korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs and remembers the original tuning tones so you can return to it for more standard usage a nice extra piece of flexibility the lcd meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you right away whether you are sharp flat and by how much or right on as a point of surprising interest the tuning fork i had used for years turns out to be profoundly flat a shock to me given that i had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones i have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be i guess the round pitch pipe that ms sweeny used to tune up the class in the th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed and finally this is a marvelous little and inexpensive device well constructed accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances i assume that there will be still higher places for my learning curve in this area to rise to but for right now this is it i am using it regularly on all my stringed instruments two six string martins a twelve string epiphone and a frailing banjo the time it saves tuning the string alone makes it more than it s own price if you have not discovered chromatic tuning maybe i really was the last one to discover these things i suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds really right perhaps people with perfect pitch can do very nicely without a chromatic tuner i am not one of them are you i just can t believe how loud this little baby is i also have a watts behringer keyboard amp inputs with lot of fx but it s a littl heavy to move around this little amp does everything i need for small gathering i tried everything as soon as i received it guitar classic mandolin acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampactually the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp the microphone although no reverb or echo is good enough for singing sounds as the true voice of the singer the mp input is which i prefer over the little volume must be controlled by the mp player itself guitar and mic have separate volume control we really need it in summary it s ready to be used right out of the box it only weights lbs so moving around is really easy can t say i ve tried all of the capos in the world but i ve had my share of the different designs first i had the bungee cord type then i had the snap on type then i had the different capos designed for acoustic or classical or electrical this one by far evolved from good design the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension the design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck all of the others i have tried use a spring that could pop out one actually did and the entire capo came apart this one even has a pick holder built in it is light weight just the right size i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar i normally get elixir strings but these sounded too good to pass up they are indeed some high tech strings with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability plus they feel and sound good so grab a pack and get jamming you ll definitely want to check these out
735	this is an inexpensive sturdy sustain pedal that i immediately buy every time i get a new yamaha keyboard this pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano much better than any footswitch only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity it may or may not work properly with non yamaha keyboards it sounds like it s behringer very fake cheap sounding phaser but it s all i need i got it mostly for that big airplane woosh and running it in the loop it does that fine the highs are kind of harsh but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame this delay pedal was so cheap that i could not pass it up and let me tell you it is easy and fun to use i stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar i actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica but those were dismal failures big win for the guitar though i don t know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off the respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it it was just a freaking hassle i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook which doesn t have a midi input but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface this mike is an awesome value you could pay twice or three times more and the frequency response is excellent service was super fast i would ve no problem buying from these folks again in the future this violin is amazing considering it s price i got it for my girlfriend expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn t she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked i am a satisfied costumer for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it this one s for you basic but sturdy gets the job done easy to see easy to use easy to get used to the display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound that is what makes it so useful you can t beat the price for such a great little tuner amazon as usual makes ordering paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience i will be buying one for every guitar case i own
736	if you re a bass player and use a pick you need one of these if you are a bass player and sometimes use a pick you really need one of these i bought one for every bass and a spare wedgies work better on bass than guitar because the strings are thicker and usually parallel i have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings but the bass ones stay put really these things are great very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound very high gain fits in all size soundholes good heavy construction of course it s not great i m not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself if you have a taylor martin or gibson that s not already ae this is not for you i probably didn t even need to say that i just have a cheep rogue that sounds good with this pickup it s just a matter of how much you want to or can spend i m happy with this pickup joe i bought two of these small but well lighted screen very quick reaction to string i liked it from the very first tuning it is quicker and more responsive than other tuners i have that cost twice the price it is small and doesn t look like a huge lump on the headstock operates with one v battery included i plan on buying a few more for other guitar cases and as gifts for my musician friends around birthdays and x mas this a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner the letters are big so you don t have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning
737	this is a nice cable made from good materials and is attractive i needed a foot cable and im glad i didn t buy one from the store this works just as stated now i can plug my mic in either way and it gives me more versitility these are exactly what the doctored ordered i have one setup to mic my guitar amp and another setup to mic my voice for doing guitar video exchanges they are excellent quality for the money phantom power supplies aren t very sexy items but they re extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones this nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm totally no frills rock solid metal construction and you can t hear it at all we use these on our wireless microphones and they have very vibrant color and easy for us to determine which microphone is associated with which volume dial on the amplifier
738	i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review if amazon used half stars i would have given them i just couldn t bring myself to give them a so i went with here s why i ve used standard medium picks for over years switching to these was not a problem at all sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems by far the biggest change was the pointy ness of the picks the distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing especially when playing chords everything is much more pronounced which isn t necessarily a good thing in my opinion it s especially bad when playing clean electric picking notes or strumming if someone was to ask me if these are good picks my answer would be it depends it really does in my opinion it depends on what you re playing from a rhythm standpoint i don t like these at all they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me for lead work they are ok because you can really dig into each note and have it come through could i play faster with them no could i pull off amazing licks that i couldn t do with my normal picks no i tried them but didn t like them maybe if you typically play a ton of lead work constantly these would be the way to go i don t and they aren t for me i m glad i tried them though because i ll never wonder again if they were for me great all round pick one of my favorites easy to grip and are pretty quite they wear out extremely fast though its ok it does what it says but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background the most diverse pedal i own you can play everything from pink floyd to parkway drive with just a few tweaks quick and accurate i also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though i love these tuners i have tried the intel krog boss etc and out of all of them i like the snark the best response and visual display are awesome unlike a couple of the others i ve used the snark works well on any place on the headstock a couple of the other brands i had to be careful where i positioned them because they didn t respond well you can t go wrong with any snark
739	sweet little neck stand very light weight folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag padded to protect guitar neck this is my nd hercules stand great stand for managing multiple guitars does not fair well when stored in non cooled area the handle gets real sticky and causes problems i have a friend who also experienced the same problem so keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand just a bag for my guitar stand no big deal but it sure makes it easier when i have all that stuff to lug around i love my hercules guitar stands but they a don t like to stay put when folded up this takes care of that problem for a couple of bags sturdy material nice draw string to close it up shoulder strap works just fine glad i bought it works great seems durable shipped fast can t think of a single negative thing about this product if you need a tuner this ones a good one
740	slap these puppies on your ten dollar squier and you ve got yourself a guitar i d describe the sound as a bit metallic ish definitely a sharper tone bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products i even sound ok when i play his guitar so i say try em out i purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing s still kickin not planning on replacing it anytime soon once i got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel action was fine for me out of the box most definitely one of the best bang for your buck acoustic guitars i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric very durable cables i ve used them all fenders aren t bad i have used these without any problems whatsoever see for yourself
741	this is a fine cable at a decent price point nothing exceptional mind but it gets the job done well enough i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics how do you review an sm i ve used these most of my life and will continue to very durable i got this to replace the same a year old rusted dented grill i also use a d akg same price and a line wirelesss but the is always reliable first choice or backup this is another adapter that i rarely use and now that i have a digital mixer i am not sure if i will ever get much use out of them with my rig traveling about to use some other rig though you never know what you might run into so i plan on keeping these little artifacts for a while longer as the digital realm and the audio realm become one things like these will become increasingly rare you will always find a place that does not keep up with the times though that alone is a good enough reason to keep stuff like this around for now solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag there isn t really much in the way of instructions but the leds are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out i used this for a while but now i have the behringer ch rack mount and this rarely gets used also every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp i still use this for practice at home i needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events for the price point i was worried about buying cheap cables this are a great value for your buck the only thing i didn t like about these the cable ties suck haha if you need some quality cheap cable these are for you i am a pro drummer and run pro sound support pa systems for outside venues as well from time to time it is essential that i have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds these ft xlr cables are made well i hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths and as usual dealing with gls and orange county they came fast packed well and safe i am a continuing returning customer because of quality price and service and though on this particular order i had no need to contact them they checked in with me to make sure everything went well great folks to deal with this amp did a good job for its rating it was my backup amp for a qsc gx i sold it after using it for about a year or so there s nothing wrong with this stand but for the life of me i cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from the pencil condenser are questionable they have picked up outside noise like birds etc but with a decent bit of white noise but i may have had them running a bit hot too the strange clamps have worked well for me i have a blue snowball mic and the stand that comes with that thing is entirely too short for my needs so i set out to find a desk stand for my microphone that i could use for podcasting and video work here are my pros and cons pros it s about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the snowball this may be too tall for some with the mic put in it stands as tall as my asus g vw but i have a raised desk so this fits right up to my mouth the snowball screws right in unscrew the holder thing that comes on there screw the snowball in win after some research i found that this will fit pretty much any mic cool it seems sturdy and well built cons the legs make this thing very very wide it s about the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space the mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird not bad just weird overall this is highly recommended for a desk stand it seems to be able to fit just about any mic and it s perfect for video voice overs and podcasts i have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over i have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and i also have some cheapies some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the cheapies i ve been dealing with musician s friend forever rogue is musician s friend s brand music is a musician s friend affiliate and they also sell rogue guitars i have several different models of rogue guitars and i m impressed with all of them the rogue ra is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the fender starcaster here s the good part the rogue is about half the price of the fender many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one once they realize it s not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten if you re not sure if you re serious about learning to play this is the guitar for you even if you re an intermediate to advanced player you still can t go wrong with this guitar it has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument the finish and workmanship is also like what you d find on a more expensive guitar they look play and sound great many people tend to shy away from rogue guitars because of the low price they figure a guitar that cheap can t be much good that s where they re wrong you have to actually play one to understand what i m talking about once you play a rogue guitar you too will become a believer this is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire if it happens to get damaged or stolen you re not out an arm and a leg i love fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar the rogue is a much better value than the fender and equal if not better in quality the rogue ra comes in a variety of color choices if or when you decide to sell it you can usually get back what you paid for it i give rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one i ve been playing guitar for years so i should know what i m talking about i do not own stock in musician s friend music or rogue guitars and i don t get paid to endorse them this review is my honest opinion some of the stands i have purchased are hollow some are solid at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand the hollow ones are a pita because they are easier to strip and bend all mic stand inventories i have bought from budget lines have this issue i wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box
742	i have used dunlop straplocks for years i bought the original style years ago for my strat les paul and partscaster the last two having the most weight these things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem i ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out it was on the strap i used the most for the heavier guitars so i got some mileage out of that thing i ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar i suggest these over the other brands watch what touring bands use these things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch if you happen to be without a strap with locks on it these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure the price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping i always buy strings picks or other stuff to get free shipping i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware i own an american strat too and plan on making the best of the chinese one going to upgrade electronics and everything else too these are exactly what s on my american strat stars works like a charm powers up to five v effects using one power supply i am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly no more dead v batteries some effects eat v batteries like a year old with a cone of cotton candy genuine fender pick guard it s pre shielded perfect for your next build or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart if you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about then this kit is for you changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack i m using this pedal like a clean boost for leads and i m very happy with it s sound uncolored db of clean gain the fulltone full drive is another incarnation of the original fulldrive now with mosfet circuitry available via toggle switch this just makes the pedal even more flexible not to mention boutique quality at a working man s price this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish the volume knob gives you lots of gain the tone knob is a presence control the overdrive knob adjusts the level of overdrive and then there is the boost level yes this is a switch pedal so when you are playing a chunky rhythm you can step on the boost switch for a great lead tone the toggle switch in between the tone and drive knobs affect the pedals tonal character as well as how the knobs affect each other there is comp cut allowing for a cleaner boost fm for flat mids and vintage for a more tubescreamer tone as a bonus the pedal is also capable of running on v power for cleaner headroom which is handy for hum bucker pick ups if you have the scratch and are looking for a perfect od pedal then look at the fulldrive it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board i bought this unit for a friend and i could compare with others overdrives i already have i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great after researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever i chose the fulltone ocd the reviews on amazon helped as well along with youtube demos and guitar mags what finally made my choice for me was when i found out that robin trower used one for his last u s tours befor fulltone made him a sig model okay this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive the hp lp switch alone gives you a very distinct tone for solos or rhythm and tweaking the dials adds to the fun i m constantly playing with the tones a minor adjustment makes a huge difference the coolest thing is that this pedal is responsive to your playing dynamics picking softly dials down the od then you can just unleash the crunch with harder attacks much better than trying to roll off the volume the true bypass is great as you lose no original signal when not engaged as of now this is my favorite piece of gear if you re looking for massive distortion keep looking but this will be my go to blues rock pedal for quite some time this tuner is awesome and accurate very noticeable and what else can i say for the price best deal ever get it ps i use it for my base though satisfied thanks korg this is an excellent choice if you re looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint it looks great it s easy to use and it s a fantastic size for a delay pedal the analog delay is nice and warm much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears also the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays there is a internal adjustment that i don t think i will need to use for now anyway i highly recommend it i wrote a nasty review of this tuner a while back blasting its performance compared to its competitors the korg pitch black and the boss tu i still own at least of each anyway i have had this tuner for a few years now stock this tuner was awful while attractive and compact in single note tuning the needle was not as fast and stable as its competitors and the polyphonic mode wasn t accurate enough either moreover the display isn t as visible as a pitch black or tu in the sunlight so while this tuner is great if you want something that looks nice and doesn t take up space on the pedal board stock it just wasn t a truly great tuner however that was before a firmware update after applying the latest updates the tuner has become very usable the polyphonic mode is still not quite good enough to rely on but the single note mode seems just as accurate as any other tuner in its price range now so now you have a small attractive tuner w true bypass that actually works so i have changed the review from to stars also given that the price has dropped sharply since i bought the tuner now it is a much better bang for the buck so yeah buy this product with confidence but if you have purchased it used or if you have an old polytune make sure that the firmware is up to date without the update this tuner was borderline terrible with the update it s good enough to be the tuner on my primary stage pedalboard and in fact it is and it has held up to regular practices and gigs with this power supply you can offer to your pedals vdc vdc vd or vac i m using pedals conected to this power supply and i don t have any kind of noise or hum replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and i m glad i did this is one lush pedal and it s all analog this pedal also sounds great with gain you can set up delays configurations what is a interesting option to use on stage tap function also helps a lot all type of delays are sounds beatiful
743	i ve had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this i recently bought it for my niece and taught her how to change her strings the different size gaps make it grab the tuning pegs much better than my old one i was able to use it on an electric steel string acoustic and classical and it grabbed them all rather well the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also so handy simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors haven t used it a great deal but it seems to be great and non damaging to the finish on the guitar the handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo but this is a good choice at a great price i love these strings because the sounds are so pure and not twangy and they are pretty easy to use each string is labeled so you know which goes where i m a beginner and can change my own strings so i m proud of myself this hand full of picks saves your fingernails they are not the best but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size i am used to quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price sounds good and the action is smooth like it better than the other tuner i bought this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again
744	this thing freaking rocks i love this pedal i can t stop using it sometimes i just play long drawn out chords so i can listen to this amazing tone in combo with distortion on my amp it s perfect metal this is an amazing pedal delay flanger phaser tremolo pitch shifter all sound really good and completely adjustable only downfall is that you can only use a single function at any one time for the price this is a steal behringer rocks bought this distortion pedal for our son who plays his electric guitar daily he loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use it also produces a nice distorted sound quality and tone i don t know if i would agree as my generation hails from a different genre of music but he loves it and i guess that s all that matters very good product bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang it comes with a daisy chain power cord that eliminates the need for separate power supplies foam inserts easily fit boss and behringer pedals but can be easily cut to house other pedals wow for the price u can not beat this pedal i got this pedal to add a second guitar harmony to some of my songs wow it sounds awesome probably the only note here is that when activate it i noticed that kinda lower the volume a little bit i do not mind though and still give it stars
745	these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws the screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so i would recommend you buy some good screws before you install i have several of these and at least three screws broke as i screwed them into the stud in the wall i was not happy with the sound of these strings the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny for an extra i bought the d addario ej pro arte and got a much much higher quality sound out of my yr old yamaha g spend the extra its well worth it on stage xcg tubular guitar stand with velveteen padding and security is very helpful tool for any guitarist i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain recommend it this is a great item because it is small lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere guitar mic stand etc at the same time because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don t pack it carefully when traveling etc the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong the clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than sheets of paper on the clip board this doesn t happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig day etc for this price it s a good buy in my opinion and with a little care you will get more than your money s worth out of it not my first intellitouch tuner i really like these tuners they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar works well as a tuner but i did return it to buy the korg tuner metronome combo thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine however this worked fine as a plain tuner i bought two of these one for each of my sons and i wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age so far they seem awesome they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them definitely not a flimsy stand this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought both of the others broke where the stem joins the clock type display could be glued together but irritating this one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable why buy this after the experience of the others well they are very good and easy to use tuners and for not much money my guitar strings cost more this one has a great display full colour and easy to read i use it on a guitar a bass and a string and it works well on all of them

747	these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well guessing they are lacking some shielding i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either a little too small if you are a mobile dj that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these it saves me minutes per event setup and break down just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event i was very skeptical about this mic being so cheap and all but i use it in my band with several other shure mics and i cant tell the difference the same pa mix and they sound the same i plan on getting a few more of these summaryat it is a great size and ok quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig other options are available slightly longer and also with a nd compartment inside no padding or impact resistance is provided but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle also available longer or with chambered configuration on different models pros good size for speaker stands mic stands guitar stands music stands other than the top shelf and other what not you may want to cram in there depending on your style affordable at availalbe on prime shippingcons this model is one compartment for speaker stands you may want a compartment model lack of any impact resistance the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas it would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands detailsin one of my bags i was able to put folding mic stands music stand other than the top piece with the shelf that does not fit even if the bag was empty folding guitar stands and still had room for some more if i wanted to put more in bag was getting kind of heavy at that point in a sconed i was able to put on stage stands oss ss b speaker stands they fit with extra room on the ends in this bag there is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands i am considering exchanging this one for a section bag so the speaker stands are separated but probably will just keep this one the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas and a zipper and handles when laying empty it is long x about wide and lays flat seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around but for serves a basic purpose with affordability
748	if you need some cables to connect your pedals look no farther these cables are perfect they deliver good sound are very small and very cheap what more could you ask for awesome pedal i love the joyo pedals they don t break the bank and sound awesome glad i bought this pedal not every tune needs tremolo i grant you but when you need one this will do the job and them some simple controls the led pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit s settings at all times silent switching in a fx loop there s not a trace of hiss hum or noise in any form in a chain running into an amp s input there is a slight volume increase not much but a little no big deal really unless you re a real tone freak there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either the box is ultra solid the jacks are all metal the switch is stout in short this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean warm tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit it it anchored to my board it is not going to come off because it s that good besides how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it this is probably the best pedal purchase i have ever made i m not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better but this one sounds exactly how i would expect a compressor to work it just makes things sound solid i ve watched the wave envelope it puts out using audacity and adobe audition and the compression works as advertised i love this it s do fun to play with every pedal that i buy of joyo amaze me they are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price i m sold out on joyo pedals
749	great inexpensive strap really what more can you say i wanted something to hold my guitar up and it does just that this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices armed with a set of headphones i can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my mp s mp player plugged in too worth the small price you pay as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on i m sure if i drop it even from a low height that door s flying off along with the battery its just a basick thin leather strap my only problem with it is it could be longer my bass sits to high with this strap set at its longest setting only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not but it sounds great as ampeg always has heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp i have several of these for my guitar fiddle and mandolin it works well for all of them and is inexpensive
750	first of all let me say from some of the pictures i have seen posted of this pop filter when put on a yeti mic stand the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured this is a design flaw not with the pop filter but with the yeti stand as this filter has been around long before the yeti came out blue or a clever do it yourself person could easily fix it by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well since i have mine hanging upside down on a boom stand attached to a blue radius shock mount this is not an issue for me but i will say it is a problem blue should fix i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems i am not going to knock any stars off because i m reviewing the filter itself which is superb and how it works for me now for the meat this is a studio grade high quality product all metal except for the two tightening knobs the dual screen design eliminates any plosives p s and b s for example better than any screen i have used so far this is especially true when the screen distance is about an inch from the yeti capsule screen and you are to inches away from the unit itself which i have found to be the yeti s sweet spot in the cardioid pattern next the silk screened blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot if you place it in front of the capsule area i like the idea of a metal screen especially if you are transporting it you won t have to worry about snagging or runs as you do with the cloth filters speaking of old cloth filters i have a neumann which is about years old a very nice screen as well but it does not cut the pops as well as the blue especially if you get closer to the mic and screen also when reading copy or maybe music i can see over and through the blue filter much better than the round inch jobs like the neumann you can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily cheaper filters i have used in the past will creep back into unwanted positions the blue behaves the blue pop is absolutely transparent no muffling as with foam filters the curved design of the blue filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all the screen is a solid build as are all of the blue products i have used so far it also fits the look of the yeti and radius shock mount like a glove surprisingly i paid a little over on amazon a real bargain in my mind for such high quality this filter is for all the blue microphones by the way and i am going to use it on my entire collection of mics addendumif you need to use the yeti as a table top mic especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter any brand i would suggest buying asamson samd md desktop mic stand which works great for this set up i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn t know the clip didn t come with it so i had to order a clip later nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks it is also rubber in construction so it won t crack like the other low quality clips it is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is good i would recommend it these great little accessories are a nice convenience the allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip this particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position older models would swivel without much effort bought to replace to older models i had on stage they ve worked out great the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands no spinning copasetic this tabletop mic stand works well designed and made from descent enough materials i would buy again when i m ready to replace the one i have or add to it
751	i bought both this stamp for guitar and also one from the same company for mandolin ukulele banjo i m pleased with both stamps large enough to see useful to stamp chords on my own music sheets and other music that dos not have guitar chords shown i was disturbed with the price of banjos until i did some research on the construction of them they re not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience at least they wouldn t be able to put together a quality banjo but jameson guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price the tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great i m a guitar player and i m excited to explore the different sounds i will be able to get out of this banjo it s also very good looking i love the neck and the back even the drum quality work was put into this thing i m quite pleased now i just need to get used to playing with strings extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark you can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument the price couldn t be better i just can t believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists i have use this tuner for quite a few years its easy to use clip it on and go i just bought of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or mandolin the price was good see ya i bought these because they were an add on offer and i m glad i did i don t play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass these are a little too soft for guitar check out the dunlops but i m going to make sure i have some of these around too works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely acoustic and electric but not at the same time haha
752	no spill no mess this is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag it will not dry out and lasts for years the only thing i don t like is the can will not fit in accessory area of my guitar case and the led has sharp edges so put it down before using the cleaner you know when a good quality item arrives everything looks and works just as it is intended i love it honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right but now it works great the black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing after a few tries i got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played height adjustment was also important if the latch is to high it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up too low and it does not sound right this replaced horrible pulse hi hat hardware that shook loose every few songs so i am completely pleased with it definitely worth i ve been playing over years and got one of these for my year old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does for it s an ok starter guitar for a kid and i guess really short people who can t play a regular fender but not something i d recommend to anyone else and my kid thinks it looks cool so he ll be more likely to stick with it even though it has a laminated body the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood the frets are crowned ok but have some sharp ends to them and i feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed it s light and easy to handle the hardware isn t bad with a stable bridge good idea not to put a floating trem in this way blade switch solid jack and strap anchors and smooth knobs the pickups are not top notch but work well enough a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does so i m not complaining it has a nice red paint job on the down side besides some sharp fret ends it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be the fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret the nut on the one i got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side so the low e string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings it has one small pit in the red finish it has no paperwork or owner s manual the tuners are kind of choppy and the body neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune it comes strung with fender s which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down so it s good for a kid just starting out i actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound but as soon as he gets bigger we ll ditch this for something better double bass pedal has a quality build solid frame quiet mechanism easy to build and breaksdown for transport solid attachment to bass drum easy to adjust with reversible mallets as nice as any pedal twicecas expensive so great value i m not a big fan of planet waves because they ruined the dare strap but this is a good product it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder i bought this amp for my year old son it is great for him but not really for a serious practice amp pros smallclean and dirty channelhead phone jackcons speaker is low quality and sounds rough when distorted or loud suggestion step up and get a better setupgood alternatives fender mustang peavey viper line spider iv vox or marshall this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own i am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but i use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model worth the wait i ve been playing rock and blues for over years i ve owned a number of amps over the years including a s ampeg watt combo and a pre cbs watt fender showman and my latest a crate watt tube amp that i bought about years ago i also have a small peavy watt solid state combo the crate has always sounded great and it s what i use exclusively in my basement studio but it weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out despite numerous repair attempts so i ve been using the peavy when i play out the last time i did i was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else i own a line pocket pod and love it so i looked into the line amps when i found that i could get a watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than i could go through in a lifetime for less than i ordered one from amazon sight unseen and unheard out of the box i was amazed at just about everything the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich the effects that i have played around with so far are amazing and i cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole spider iv and the thing is loud very loud as i get more experience with the amp i m sure that i m going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome i m sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a watt solid state combo with speaker as their main amp and if you ve got to spend and a roadie i guess they d be right but for the money the sound the size and the very light weight lbs alone make this a fabulous deal add in the modeling and the effects high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves and compared to my crate vc at the spider iv seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function i doubt that i will use my crate again except when guests come to jam and then the less than good it doesn t come with a foot switch you have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and or take advantage of the channels on the fly and to upload new firmware to the amp and of course you really want to do all if that and more so a foot controller is essential i opted for the fbv express mk ii the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal it lets me access all channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume wah controller it was another it is really essential so in my mind the price of the spider iv is really just under and it doesn t come with any manuals to speak of all the manuals are available online for free but of course you have to download them and print them and these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp if you do not have access to a computer and a printer i guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not i guess you re sol the advanced guide is the essential one for using the amp and is only pages long that s too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail and it s not particularly well written there a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another pages long i have not explored it much yet but i suspect that it will be written similarly once again if you do not have a computer with an internet connection there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the spider iv that you will not be able to do my guess is that it would have probably added to the list price of the amp for line to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual and at the amp would seem less attractive to many so line opted to handle things the way they did bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal very highly recommended jm tepper i ordered this tuner so i could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag it s worked fine i ve used it to tune a ukelele a bass and a guitar and it works fine on all counts i have no complaints about it
753	i bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold shure sm and sm however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise these clips are in from front to back in comparison the shure clips are in to in from front to back so the shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well the gooseneck holds its position well when adjusted into place in front of the microphone also the clamp works well however the gooseneck initially made some snapping sounds when flexing it that now seems to be in the past generally perhaps it s a tubing issue i have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone
754	works great its a good product just what i expected i expect to buy more of these in the future and for its price its well worth it in the beginning i had problems however i have a classical guitar and i may have been hitting dual strings accidently at first after several days i felt much better about it i m pretty new to this so i take the blame this was a great purchase my son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford he would definitely purchase from here again this is the third snark tuner the others were snark ii i have bought both of the others broke where the stem joins the clock type display could be glued together but irritating this one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable why buy this after the experience of the others well they are very good and easy to use tuners and for not much money my guitar strings cost more this one has a great display full colour and easy to read i use it on a guitar a bass and a string and it works well on all of them
755	i look at many stands before i brought this one the rating were great and i m very pleased with the purchase if i need another stand i will buy this one again with no hesitation i got this for my wireless mics but they don t fit in this holder i got the wrong size holder other then that it is a good holder if you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these they are well made and do work i would buy them again got the mics from dealer fast i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver it fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base
756	after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually i used to devote so much time to sitting there winding forever by hand with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time it also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts that on the bottom e i did a double take it is almost invisible thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one re stringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread not at all i am a bass player and most winders don t work very well with the large tuning keys this one works better than anyone i have tried none of them work as good as i would like once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results i m a bass player and so i don t deal with cut picks much these picks are really hard and last forever i did not notice any additional string wear or damage these would probably better suited to guitarists at first i thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous but after actually trying one i love it it has really helped me deliever that fatal blow i can honestly say this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out not to mention that it s hard to strum and sounds awful what these picks are good for is leads rock metal shredding and even country the sound is short with a very high tone pitch switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull one plus is while recording i do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking shredding as i did with a plastic pick i still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound but love these picks when things heat up also i d like to add that even though i can play rock you like a hurricane by the scorpions it never sounds quite right until now using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound also these picks have a no slip grip with the fender facing your fingers there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it s very easy to grip and use it feels funny at first but i got use to it really quick i can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience
757	if you thought a pick is a pick like i once did long ago you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and or complexity i use the dunlop tortex mm purples early on in my playing i was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better why after messing about i found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack the interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard with a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility i tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid s i like the dunlops feel grip and durability they hold up for a very long time how long i have had some last a few years they are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability my students use them too i don t demand it but i do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges highly recommended you won t be disappointed running to pedals on my board this was a logical choice of power the single transformer running into the board with the multi plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board there is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak further with the transformer being well away from the board there is zero ac hum what s not to like here i started out wilth balls when i first picked up the guitar in when i was they were worth my part time minimum wage money and gave me what i wanted a very reliable product that took me through the transition from an amateur to a professional lead guitarist i highly recommend them keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag
758	meh these things are what they are they didn t solve any problems or make anything better oh well sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason these are the original perfect fit on my american deluxe strat so durable i got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful d good stuff not an exciting item i ll admit but they work as advertised and i do love having strap buttons on my instruments easy upgrade fit with no problem direct replacement for the stock tuners make changing strings a whole lot easier glad i did it nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat installed easy and the screws and everything were correct i would recommend this i have a telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body i had to trim them down the neck is well made the fit it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same time i did have to sand the neck a little it had a bump in it the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states
759	its much better than what i got with my violin its been good i can t really complain considering its basically tree sap this string set offers typical d addario quality and value i use d addario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle i was given a violin fiddle by my friend who decided they would never really learn to play the violin hadn t been used in quite some time so the pegs were really loose and wouldn t tune at all i got this product to see if i could fix the problem it worked just as it said it would a drop or two on each peg tightened them up enough to be able to tune the violin now that it s being played more regularly it s easier to tune but know that if they pegs get loose again i have the product to fix the problem i own a few tuners including a boss tu recently i purchased and reviewed the new gogo tt clip on tuner i never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my boss the gogo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner i use but now i have to say i think the snark is a little better i bought the sn and the sn because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate the other great thing is they are chormatic so besides being a great tuner you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard the display is very easy to read better than the gogo although gogo has a new improved display since i bought mine i love the colors and the matte finish too the rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners the rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too i had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my gogo the snark is less than half the price of my gogo and out performs it it s a no brainer exactly what it says it is comes fast in an envelope hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though design looks great in the light too
760	the rat has been used by everyone from david gilmour to dave grohl to give you a grasp of its range it does everything from light crunch to marshall style thick rhythms to all out face melting distortion rich harmonics near infinite sustain and a mid range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it the fact that it s built like a tank ensures it s going to be around a long time after my playing days are over thought i would give this pedal a shot since it was inexpensive and sounded really good in the online videos posted for it pros very good sound quality many options for echo to suit every individual taste bright blue flashing red for tap tempo led s stereo dual out in operation tape analog digital types of delay awesome guitar signal smooths out when engaged and class a bypass cons volume decrease by a hair when you engage the pedal signal becomes a little bass ier but it sounds good with the analog echoes batteries go fast get the adapter all in all it was worth the money comes with a warranty too so no reason not to try it a lot of options available with this good sounding pedal tone is subjective i have little experience with tube voodoo so all i can say is that it is working well for me i would buy again the fender vibro champ is a great little amp i m amazed at how good this amp sounds a small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of sound this is a watt tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp this is a much better and louder amp than the small solid state starter practice amps by all the major manufacturers fender uses two very standard tubes for pre and amplification ax and v both are fender branded tubes these are nice clean tubes that react consistently the amp takes about seconds to warm up and draws watts the cool part of this amp is the voice settings in reality the amp packs effects for different amps tweed blackface british hot rod metal jazz and acoustic the first five have three different levels of style each our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack if i m being really honest i like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack this is a clean simple amp to use the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot sadly the volume only goes to once the voice is selected there are effects settings possible with two or three level for each vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the f x level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied set to the effect isn t used at all this is probably the least useful part of the amp there is no pedal selection so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in you re kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again there s no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song there is a gain knob i like the speaker on this amp it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound the internal speaker is connected with a inch jack so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple inch speaker cable very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker the back panel also has a inch jack line out this is a great small gig or practice amp the sound is outstanding the amp is used with a gibson lucille and a les paul standard plus this is one of the best pedals i have on my board i originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this i was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect which can be breathtaking the settings are all quite useful church plate spring hall room gate etc and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay there is also a toneprint setting which is nice but honestly the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound the toneprint seems redundant i leave this pedal on most of the time along with my corona chorus and flashback delay it is part of my sound
761	summary for those who don t want to read the whole thing this is more than worth the money if you re a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you re experienced and are searching for a backup travel option or anything like that get this do not hesitate a cheap guitar doesn t always mean a pos alright full story review so when i was a kid up until my early teens my insanely talented and self taught older brother helped me learn how to play guitar i got pretty decent but somewhere along the way i stopped and i ve regretted it basically every day ever since then recently i decided to stop internally griping about it and realized i should actually do something about it so here i am having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists i have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and i have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars like a typical beginner s first act i knew there was a middle ground and i was determined to find it i got way more than i bargained for i began my quest knowing that my funds were limited there was no way i could afford to dive right in and buy a high end top of the line fender or martin like i had had the benefit of learning on back in the day i knew i had to go cheap at least for now i began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars after an exhaustive amount of research i chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos i d pulled up on youtube were excellent plus epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general despite the positive reviews i was still a bit leery buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble even if it sounds nice and plays well sometimes a perfectly solid functional instrument just doesn t feel right as i went through the checkout i silently reminded myself that i could send it back for any reason i went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility i d just have to bite the bullet and buy something better even if costlier well it arrived earlier this week and i am not disappointed i certainly didn t expect perfection and i was convinced that i would find some kind of error if only cosmetic with such a cheap guitar i am here to tell you that i have not found anything wrong with it even if i had unless it drastically affected the sound playability of the instrument it would still be worth the price along with the guitar i bought some new strings martins because times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful i was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable i see that some of the other reviewers disagree maybe their strings were older or maybe it s just preference i don t know all i can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded old shockingly enough the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box it doesn t seem to have any trouble staying in tune either all of that being said it wouldn t hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe i mean i m sure that when i do finally put the martins on i ll be even more mind blown than i already am with the way it sounds this guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably the low action helps and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets oh and contrary to what other reviews have said yes it does have a truss rod while we re talking about its positives let s not ignore the fact that it s also super attractive with its shiny black finish there isn t much about it that would give away its price no it s not a guitar but it certainly doesn t play like a guitar either i don t regret this purchase at all even in the future when i progress and upgrade i will definitely be keeping this lovely gem if you re still unsure do what i did and listen to some demos on youtube i doubt you ll be disappointed pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the gearwire youtube channel did he clearly doesn t know what he s talking about and i as well as everyone else in the comments section was sure to express my feelings about that haha one user even claimed epiphone should sue him check out the video reviews by the users companies goldhat samashmusic giggear and shadowfw my only complaint about this guitar is that i didn t buy it sooner good luck on your search i hope this review has helped what can i say it works i think i could write a book here not just a solid little mic holder glad i bought it this pad is great for midi vsti s drums queuing and it s got great action works great with ableton reason fl studio cantabile performer and a whole bunch more daws and hosts the software is a little lame and doesn t always work properly but you don t really need it that much anyways so it s whatever the bag is simple canvas it probably won t protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment i tried purchasing a soft case that had the seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar it didn t it was way too short for my seagull s coastline this is a sturdy case that looks good too
762	i put a pair of these on every guitar that i own i have a lot of extra strap clips around since i have many more guitars than straps but these are great they are all plenty tough and if i find myself with my straplok d strap it s nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch the tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when i ve been playing a lot the problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pull offs less fluid a few strokes of ghs makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience an alternative would be using vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard also i sometimes use an emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but i d rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong ghs allows me to minimize that comes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple the cable is great material the s with boots are just right and have a lot of strength for durability price is right for sure this tuner is wonderful you can tune all strings in same time it s halpfull in stage because you don t need to test each string individually
763	this little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size the locking knobs do their job without fail and i don t have to over crank them to get them to hold i use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer recording interface and all the other stuff i use for recording it adjust perfect for vocals and i drop it down if i want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup same with my violins i get a different sound recording through a mic than i do a pickup the base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way you must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction it will stand securely in any direction i set it where i want it then just swing it out of the way till i need it i have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics it s just more accessible on the desk this would work fine for drummers i would recommend this to any of my critical buddies thanks these sound good on my electrics the best sound i got was on my lp good sustain and strings are staying in tune well i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp it s got a great tone much better than the black one i had yrs ago i just downsized from a watt blues deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side i can say they sound very very similar as they have the same speaker but the bj is much lighter that being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo i was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone didn t do that on my last one this pedal works great for that too it feels very solid and it doesn t make any audible clicking noises that i can hear when engaging it small amazing good quality interface this is not the presonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable i especially like the dual inputs on front back light on knobs shows clipping on volume green and red and connected green usb powered and plug and play my ableton suite detected and connected in seconds i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it i was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin naturally when the electric arrived i laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem i plugged it into my fender amp with a little reverb and wow is how i can describe what came out it sounded like i was in a great concert hall of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it now i haven t tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous cant say enough except the price was so low i couldn t have gone wrong too bad
764	these just happen to be my favorite i always keep mm mm and mm sizes on hand mostly use the s i ve been using them for years and so will probably never change i like the grippiness of them i hate smooth picks picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like i have one of these in every one of my cases it s a plastic sponge holder with holes in it nothing special but it does the job the j s are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments they are bright and brassy when new and give a decent punch to the sound however because they are bronze they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier also since they are round wound they are harder to fret than a flat wound string and harder to shift up and down but the people who like them change them often like once in days or so or whenever they play a gig to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new this is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume being less elastic and less lively one thing is sure that the j s are loud and zingy and that s why dealers put them on their mandolins some folks move to the heavier j s to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops the j s are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you re in ensemble work just make sure to change them often to get the best performance a year ago i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r wave mp recorder blackand thezoom h handy recorder gb accessory kit pre accessory kit i wanted a high quality easy to use recorder so even though the h had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use zoom has responded with the h a scaled down version of the h with all of the features of the r and all of the controls right where you need them the h even has additional features over the r but they don t get in the way for example there s a choice of a degree recording pattern a degree recording pattern and even a surround sound option samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website one big complaint i ve had with the edirol is the cost of its add on stand unlike the edirol the h comes with a simple stand in addition the h has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod on a separate note it s much easier to replace batteries with the h than the edirol recently i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r and the zoom h i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness the first time we played them back i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units the second time we played them back my preference was for the h with overall opinion continuing to be split we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all i do prefer the edirol s control buttons to the h s membrane and i m not about to sell the edirol perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and don t want to give it up just yet also the edirol r is the darling of the moment however if i owned neither i couldn t justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h and would opt for the h when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i d need only one recorder i grabbed the h what can you say about rosin this rosin seems to be better than the cheapo kind i had and so i feel it is worth the extra money
765	i recently ordered this ukulele and others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as i wanted to give them a few options okina uk soprano ukulele with rosewood fingerboard naturaldiamond head du ukulele naturalmahalo u or painted economy soprano ukulele orange lanikai lu soprano ukulelekala ka s mahogany soprano ukulelethe okina diamond head and mahalo were all under at the time and within price of each other of the three i thought that the mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality the okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own and year old ukuleles which had the original strings a string upgrade to aquila strings helped significantly but even then the okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level the diamond head and mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice for this price little gig bag incidentally what the mahalo product description says is a color matching brown gigbag ended up being black but black is pretty standard gig bag color the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the diamond head s that being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the mahalo since it s so near the same price compared to the diamond head and has better strings already installed i ve also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages i ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews i found it to be excellent for the price and so far have had no problems with the zippers this product is described as a soprano ukulele gig bag and that is exactly what it is a gig bag is not a rigid faa approved flight case nor is it a semi rigid polystyrene case with soft covering reviewers that don t believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a gig bag and don t understand the term you wouldn t put your reading glasses in a soft padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you i don t know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag but i found that it fits the soprano size perfectly it is very well padded for a gig bag having extra padding at the base of the instrument where the bottom strap button would be if you have one to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end it also has a nicely padded handle i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well ukulele not included they cost a little more than this liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as i must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes i bought another for my step son i did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re seating the battery it has not had a problem since
766	i m not sure how much i can say about a mute it s easy to put on and take off and it does its job it mutes the violin to a reasonable level i used an spl meter at a distance where a sustained open g string gave a reading of about db with the mute it dropped to db i then tried a yamaha silent electric violin unplugged and from the same distance it barely registered i recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about db and the yamaha read about db at that distance and setting so it won t make your instrument completely silent and from a purely subjective perspective it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin perhaps seeming about to louder had i not measured it with accessories tonal quality is typically important but with a mute you expect it to deteriorate surprisingly there was still a lot of tone left especially compared to the unplugged electric yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced you can t expect this to give great sound or complete silence but it won t disturb the neighbors or their dogs and it won t make the instrument sound dead this is about times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin and the latter will probably sound worse it s not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice awesome cheap repalcement string i would recommend them to anyone who doesnt want to spend bucks on high quality strings this is a great little amp especially for the money it s all tube has a power attenuator headphone out and reverb all for under crazy it s built extremely well and has some weight to it but you d have no problem carrying it to a small gig a watt tube amp is still quite loud so the attenuator is a god send how does it sound you ask tone is subjective but to my ears it can get quite marshally without a lot of work with a les paul as well as a tele i don t own a strat so i can t comment on single coils through it on the watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about i had a damn good back in black style hard rock tone if you want to play metal you re going to need a distortion overdrive pedal i ve found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy the headphone out isn t great it s good enough for practice but don t try to use it as a line out for recording i ve done some recording using a on axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center when stacking tracks especially using different guitars i got a huge plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy i haven t swapped tubes or the speaker it s completely stock i might try putting a jensen speaker in it but the stock tone is just fine as it is the stock speaker is an bugera vintage think greenback clone and it is darker than a lot of small speakers a lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for jj s or gt s but it all depends on what you re after for tone a lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the beringer name on it bugera is made by beringer but i found this amp to be very good quality especially given that it was made in china i would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap it s an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type i was able to get great marshall like tone out of it quite easily good stuff if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it i ve tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer it is great for a quick way to get electrified lead wire is not very substantial but if it breaks in the future hopefully i can just buy another one to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
767	this is a good pedal overall rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so i took the chance and i m pleased as some have said the low range has quite a steep slope to it uncomfortable foot angle but it s a big pedal and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so i can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth i wish the ts jacks were top bottom instead of side by side seems it would take right angle connectors better one gets in the way of the other or even better if it were a trs jack so you d only need one input i might modify it for that received the unit plugged it into my alesis q tested it in logic pro x and it works fine the pedal itself is solid nothing more to say happy with purchase first keys are not my best instrument to play just a beginner i m a professional guitarist that said i purchased this for my home recording studio the controller that i had was a ion but had mini keys i love the fact that this controller has full size keys works great with my mac book pro and logic pro x i know it s not the best controller but it s good if your on a limited budget
768	well what can i say based on the customer reviews this purchase seemed like a no brainer however after only months of light use used on my rig at home it is toast the cable barely holds a signal now constantly need to jiggle the thing to work and before you ask is it perhaps your output jack all of my other cables work with my gee tar so it is definitely the cable anyway i gave it stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc i ve never had one of these pots fail on me never had one go scratchy i m sure they will as most pots will but i ve either been fortunate or these are very well made pots quality tuners overall i like the look and feel of these the only complaint i have is that after locking the strings the tuners loosen slightly a short while later so i have to continually check that they are indeed still locked all in all though very good for the price this neck plate rides on the body of a mexico made jazz bass which i acquired second hand replacing the blank factory plate it could be thicker it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender f logo this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack it is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but that s an easy adaption if using a copy strat it works perfectly great price from the seller as well if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets
769	i ve been using elixir strings since gore first made prototypes over years ago i use both electric and acoustic the product performs exactly as they guarantee it will every once in a while i ll get a dead string i ll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge same thing with strings that break while tuning them up this is really a no frills stand except the addition of a neck guard strap which is a nice touch it is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable there s really not a lot more to say about it except that at i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed i would certainly not spend or dollars on a stand when i could buy one of these i may have misunderstood the product description but i prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this my issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when i play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you don t get me wrong there was nothing wrong with the product itself it just wasn t what i thought i bought five of these when they were being blown out for like apiece but even at the normal price they are a bargain they are comfortable when used for an extended period of time even with a heavy les paul if you play an sg these will help counter the dreaded neck dive that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars incidentally amazon is selling these straps at about the price you would pay at gc highly recommended i ordered this capo on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday i had never used a capo of this design so i was a little skiptical but i figured with the price i might as well give it a try this thing works great there is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar the spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board i have only used kyser capos in the past but this one works just as well only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to otherwise you ll get some rattling noise from the strings once you get the hang of placing it where you need it it works very fast when you need to change keys
770	it only holds heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to except i did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars these are good don t get me wrong works as advertised i was a bit skeptical when the product arrived but i just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work pretty simple even if you re technically challenged easy to use haven t gigged with it yet but i can imagine that this strap isn t going anywhere regarding its functionality not a pretty product but good stuff the price was right so i got one does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music books don t do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time even some smaller ones strictly for practice if you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp it sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks i said good not loud loud enough yes i suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time this is a great little amp for camping a quick lesson or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc if you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased great color and retro style as well for the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build it matches my epiphone sheraton ii well although it doesn t twist easily my neck strap pin is on the backside of the guitar great little tuner easy to work with and also easy to find the price is also right and i recommend
771	these work just like you want them to but a new strap and put these on right away it s worth it ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early s they have never let me down very comfortable in the hand not much to say about patches they haven t given me any trouble which is as good as it gets with cables i have an epiphone es and recently put these strings on it oh man do they sound nice it s like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy slinkkkkkkyyyy d this is a great value i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series it fits perfectly thank you
772	i seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and i have great access to it fantastic it a simple holder that it s really good to make sure that you will not be out of picks when you need then fits nice and provides good protection
773	i ve only used the string winder so far but it works well so far i use it on my guitars and my banjo the other things look like they will work well but i haven t used them yet so i can t say for sure if not then i ll update this review if i can i shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices checked out amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price but pleasantly surprised when we received it got these as a gift for my year old nephew he loves them the only problem is that his friends keep walking off with them if you own an iphone ipod touch and play guitar or bass you need this one was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this the sound is incredible buy it seriously i ordered this epi jr because i had one years ago my son adopted for his own and missed having one saw this in tv yellow and had to have it i came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website it was set up very well among the few guitars i have purchased that were playable out of the box fret work is top notch finish is good some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you ll add some of your own there was a slight binding in the nut most people think it s the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut a quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up if you can t make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech when you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue the only thing i did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream plugged in it sounds good you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region this guitar will make you a more versatile player the absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out sustain is very good as a result i could carry on forever but you get the idea i ve been a player for years and a collector for half of that i own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch i have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports the quality is superb on the most recent ones tone snobs may laugh but my new epi les paul jr plays just as well as most anything out there
774	this makes sliding on the bass real smooth it s also nice for cleaning it is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time and it s super easy to apply even though you re not a pro act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play i have finally discovered that the perfect set is a moving target as arthritis creeps in i find myself playing heavier strings with a lower action and these work in that respect another advantage of usiung this set is that it beefs up the treble side without making the bass side too boomey telecaster anyone i bought of these and hung fender strats on my wall comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly couldn t be happier with this product as some of the other reviews state you barely need any type of guitar cleaner when using these microfiber cloths i ve found for the best results use a wax sealant product and then use this cloth separately and afterward to clean your guitar the fingerprints and smudges lift off effortlessly i love these picks especially in this gauge they are a bit thinner than the jazz s so if you master em you can in theory play faster they have a good grip and a nice texture the tone it gives isn t bad either the previous reviewer obviously got a defective case the case i got works incredibly well and always keeps the guitar well protected and my back comfortable while carrying it it has a lot of space and it looks pretty good too i d recommend it to anyone edit i ve had good years with this bag and it has still yet to rip on me i like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing this is the best usb condenser mic i ve ever used i needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be xlr i bought the at xlr version simply due to the fantastic results i ve achieved with this one i only use this microphone for podcasting i do not record music with it but i haven t tried yet if you re curious as to the sound quality listen to my podcast rock crushes paper on itunes and zune marketplace just to give you an idea of what i m using windows gb rampentium dual core ghzadobe auditon the build quality is fantastic built like a tank really the only knock i have on this is the little tripod stand yes it s a tripod stand but i can t imagine actually being in a spot where i d rather use that then the on stage desktop mic stand anyways great mic can t recommend it enough it s made me check out other audio technica products i m a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices i play guitar mandolin and ukelele and this inexpensive tuner is the best one i ve ever used by a long way i ve paid a lot more for a lot less it has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone the dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles and it has the fastest and best response of any tuner i ve ever used it doesn t require a loud volume to hear the tone finally it doesn t seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone if i detune by about th of a turn on my tuning machine an difference i can t hear with my own ear this device detects it immediately all in all this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning
775	i am yet another one of those forever beginners when it comes to playing the guitar never mind that these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better after putting in new pegs and re stringing with these strings it sounds so much nicer more richer now i see i need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose i think that once i do this and then re string these same strings on it i will be set to go i like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years let s face it my fingers get sore when playing i also have small fingers and hands i intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use i recommend i used to use elixir nano string and a good as they sound they do not last these do great sounding strings nothing that spectacular really it did it s job was easy for my husband to use made me able to use a strap on my guitar this capo does what it needs to do makes it sound great and is a great price there are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar it does not break and is very sturdy highly recommended
776	this adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small dv cameras will function but with caveats first it s construction is pretty light weight that means you will have to be gentle with it when using it that s something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it this is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera that means you would need another short xlr mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter so just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others i went to sam ash music and found a similar adapter cable heavy duty and with a longer cable for the same price it pays to shop around i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics it is exactly as represented it does a fine job i have used it in recording live band practice sessions i would if necessary purchase this item again the shure xlr female to male adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit i ve got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to now this one as pictured is the mono version which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced jack if you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable this adapter will not work for you you ll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter
777	i get everything on amazon now need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment he makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings i do not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time stretch them bend them and they don t break if your bending a couple steps or more then i would love to know what string holds up consistently thanks much simple strong but easy to apply comes in a variety of colors haven t used it a great deal but it seems to be great and non damaging to the finish on the guitar the handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo but this is a good choice at a great price the shell and the lining of the case are perfect hard on the outside and soft on the inside i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in the only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen i m not traveling around with my guitar too much so that s not a problem for me but i would worry a bit if i were checking it on an airline otherwise it works perfectly for what i bought it for protecting it in my mancave basement from dings and scratches hm i received this i opened this i ve used it i also use it this product seems to be a pretty good product i m a total beginner so i don t really know if my review will be useful i have nothing to compare these too except my lee oskar they sound good to me that s what s most important right these do have a kind of nasty new car smell to them but i m leaving the box open to see if airing them out helps it s not a big deal but it s the only negative i can find with them rock on bro needed a ft cable for home recording at my desk all the other long ones would have made a mess under my feet good thing there was this shorty nice cord sturdy build good sound electrons go through it and don t leak out so it s perfect i guess so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it i ve used this in my jam lab for years and use it every time i play electric about hours a week the unit itself has held up well no problems with case or pedals all switches knobs plugs display work fine it doesn t have a on off switch but that s minor it s low profile and is easy to switch by foot i have it going into my mixer which works fine no feedback or buzz from it i like the recording software cubase that came with it i didn t think i d use it much but i do it s fun and easy to record my own songs cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close but i ve learned nothing happens and it s fine i don t use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man which if you don t have you need it the drum presets are fun to use it s a blast to set a drum track loop a rhythm then jam on top of it isn t that what it s all about my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn t some flaw i guess also the clean presets like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak i don t like them at all the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone they rock i use alot of the other ones as well imho this the must have addition to your set up it s not for professional use but when i turn pro i ll get something better i read many negative reviews on several sites i can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in g a and bb there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments this is what gives them their charm and voice i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do the set is quite nice for the price
778	i bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage it works for that it s a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables and that makes me a little cagy about its durability i tend to use it for cable runs where i don t expect a lot of movement e g running a cable to a mic stand and save my better cables for the belt pack mics the jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell and it really activated my allergies at first i stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell not everyone has allergies so this might not be an issue for all folks but i couldn t use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months they re cheap and they work fine i haven t noticed any sound issues at all i bought this one to replace a shure it s a big step up from that one i am pleased with it the old one had a lot of handling noise this one has a little but it is very good for the money i paid for it my next one will be an sm but that will be awhile from now i m very happy with this pg update december the handling noise is definitely something to consider it would keep me from buying another one of these other mics i own don t have this problem to this degree great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the p s i don t know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue i use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough i can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound i bought this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp it fits very well and sounds great it s light and has great sound for interviews i would recomende this mic for any station and we are z net visit us on the web and hear it live i had to send my first one back the second one is working fine so far i ve noticed it works better with some daws than others also if you are having problems with it it could be you daw software it works great with reaper this is my first real recording microphone i really like it i use it to record vocal with my home studio setup and it does a good job this has more features than i ll ever likely use has worked flawlessly for recording acoustic guitar to my computer appears to be well made i recently bought an audio technica and was looking for a shockmount for it i bought the one that audio technica makes and i was not satisfied with the quality so i returned it and came across the samson sp my first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount i have for my neumann tlm i immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the at as soon as it arrived i put my at in it and it looked stunning after i mounted it on my on desk mic stand i bumped the table a few times to see how it worked in short it works great the sp isolates the mic extremely well i also tested the shockmount with my studio projects c and rode k both very heavy mics and it works great one word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand which i find extremely amusing like most shockmounts the samson sp has an adapter that is too small for most us mic stands already in the mount the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand this is easy to remove all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand i have had the shure version of this mic not naming any names haha and this mic is just as good actually i take it back it s better than the shure mic because this one isn t overpriced this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to i like the extra cable clips that came with it so i can keep it wrapped up untangled
779	this is a great tremolo pedal it is very quiet and when used correctly there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever you can blend the tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged on off type tremolo tremolo varies the volume of the sound it does not vary the pitch you have control over the depth or amount of effect and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound a very simple popular effect that i wouldn t want to live without in some form or another pretty teal green color as with all boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged i have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because i use a power supply there is no on off clicking when depressed there is no added hiss hum or distortion the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything simply a great effect and quality product from boss and tends to hold its resale value well everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body my favorite acoustic guitar is over years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when i am changing chords or fingering the fret board the fender medium is my second choice for picks my first is the just strings pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer less scrape feel on the strings at half the price pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion after trying out a few other styles and brands i settled on this stand wanting something that would keep my s telecaster from taking an unexpected fall the overall design of the stand is great but i had to return my first stand as there were severe quality issues with the finish there were at least spots where the black finish didn t stick to the metal and i essentially had bare metal spots sticking out the neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about degrees to the right once it was clamped down to the main stand body disappointingly the replacement unit i received also has this issue but only about degrees worth i m going to use this stand in the meantime while i try to find something of a nicer finish and truly worthy of my guitar i don t know if its me but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on i use this for booster really sounds good use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp also it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedal i recomend this one for those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have holds up your insterment while changing strings your insterment doest slide around on you and it folds up keep it right in your case very cool tool to have thanks great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars soft touch easy care can t beat it sure it s a bit pricey but i think having a top notch power supply for your pedalboard is priceless just being able to do away with a power strip or two full of wall warts is amazing in itself the fact thing this cuts down on floor noise and conditions your power supply too sign me up pair this up with a pedaltrain board and you ve got yourself a sweet setup i ve ordered two of these kits in the aged white and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor accidentally stepped on them and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale the knobs covers and tips are all in great shape however i bought this for my brother for a christmas gift when we got him a guitar he never used it but not because of anything to do with the actual product the ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear it s built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time i ve had it since i normally power it with a wall wart i don t have much of an opinion about battery life bottom line it costs a bit more than the standard dunlop wah pedals it s worth it i decided to get this tweed strap for my s telecaster classic but when it arrived i was a bit let down the tweed finish is cool enough but the strap is very thin and the strap ends are pretty poor quality if they truly are made of leather i feel sorry for the hide they came from the leather is so hard you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locks this is decent for the time being but i am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar feels like wearing a casio with a suit i love guitar picks i have tested alot of them and this is by far the best one that i have found yet they are perfect to hold and very tough although i do wear through them quickly but i do that to all picks dunlop always makes top notch products so when it came time to find a slide i knew where to look this one produces a great tone and is well made like the other reviewers mention here you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits for general home use though i wouldn t worry about it too much though after returning the pedaltrain jr too small i received the pedaltrain with soft case and it fits the bill perfectly i am using a voodoo lab pedal power plus unit and had some minor issues getting the plug ins to line up with the cutouts on the board itself as the other user here mentions the cutouts on the board are slightly too close together you can center the voodoo in such a way to make sure both plugs are useable but the overall install is not in line i did not run into any connector issues mentioned by the other user review here using the voodoo lab pedal power plus system all connectors that came with the voodoo lab pedal power plus fit perfectly and there are no clearance issues one quick pro tip leave the connector brackets slightly loose when installing your voodoo lab pedal power plus as this will let you make fine adjustments once the voodoo lab pedal power plus is dropped into the back of the pedaltrain once this are lined up to your liking or as close as possible based on the narrow cutouts then you can tighten your brackets screws all the way down and then use a punch to mark your indented drill holes there is a pretty decent video on youtube by pedaltrain which will help with the process my only small complaint is that they don t use a center punch you should always use something to create a starter divot especially when working with soft metals overall this is a great pedalboard i am running boss tr boss od mxr dyna comp mxr phase dunlop crybaby eh cathedral reverb and eh stereo memory man w harzai and there is plenty of breathing room nothing is cramped and there is plenty of space for patch and power cable routing the board i received came supplied with plenty of soft sided velcro there is another review here where the user states they didn t receive enough velcro i cut strips for each of the cross bars and still had about of soft sided velcro left over let s be very clear from the start the pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality the board is solid and the bag is very well made and will last a life time as other people have pointed out though pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap d rings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder the only reason this is not a star review is because of the d rings that being said don t let that detract you from buying this i just feed the shoulder strap through the carry handle and it works well enough i ended up ordering this cable to connect a q wah into a dyna comp on my pedaltrain board it s the perfect length as the foot cable was just a little bit too short since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard i ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row on a pedaltrain board it s the perfect length and the very slight bit of excess can be zip tied against the pedaltrain leaving a total stealth install since then i ve ordered these patch cable in other lengths and they ve done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard very very good tune result it really put yout guitar in tune but the arm is so fragile it has broken monthes after the purchase so i had to repair it manually with glue i recommend cheap the best way to describe this stand it serves it s purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand
780	you can use a standard eye glass cleaning cloth about quid with this instead of buying a micro fibre cloth at quid they both do the same imo you could also use eye glass cleaning solution instead which i have in the past but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars but not on eye glasses smiles this really does shine up your wood quite well i recommend good quality adjustable and does not get in the way great improvement over spring capos not much more to say but need five more words to post
781	i ve got three of these simply because they work and they re easy to carry from place to place and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this leaning stuff the perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar my daughter loves it instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice installs in minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another however you cannot go wrong with those strings i highly recommend them i like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings i have tried i owned this pedal for many years before finally trading it in on some other equipment it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing the sound it does very well is the late s early s fuzz sound white room black curtains satisfaction ina gadda da vida note this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound as i said it does one thing very well but its range even with classic rock is quite limited if you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound this pedal gets you of that sound if you want to also cover other classic rock you re gonna need at least one more overdrive distortion effect i ve used these on the reg for a year obviously there are better sounding monitors out there but these are really great for what you pay for imo i d recommend these to someone trying to save some money updatetwo years in with continued regular use they sound just as good as they did a year ago
782	i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help where the stand shines if micing amps some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease works just as it should love it and a great price to boot i bought this because it was cheap and figured it can t be that bad i was surprised that it was good i had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldn t tell the difference nice amp for the money but couldn t push a single peavey sp sub so i moved this amp to push a pair of dual s still had trouble getting the range that i needed so i have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single ev sub rated at watts it should handle it nicely bridged i will keep you posted quality is really outstanding for the price sound is clear and crisp i get a lot of feedback but i guess that it is not because of the microphone
783	i use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp which is in a soundproof box the cord is reliable and clean sounding i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence excellent cord hopefully this review will be usefull to you i get everything on amazon now need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping elixir is what tom anderson uses and i trust his judgment he makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings i do not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time stretch them bend them and they don t break if your bending a couple steps or more then i would love to know what string holds up consistently thanks much as a professional guitar player i am always nervous playing a show with old strings however i ve been using elixir for over years now and the strings really do last a long time i would usually replace my strings every month but i ve started leaving them on for up to months item arrived on time and as described my son loves this polish cleaner he likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny they glisten when he uses this to polish them great product this is a great microphone it s light sensitive and looks professional i used this alongside my xonar dg sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted db i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording
784	it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp i just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home it does the job well if you re looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then it s perfect many adjustments to get just the right position it s definitely not a performance mic as it does feel a bit filmsy but you won t notice the flimsiness except for when you re adjusting it adjusting it is a tad tedious but you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes i ve mounted my samson q u dynamic cardioid usb microphone to it it works well for sure then i attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension or it will tip over if there s too much weight just find something semi heavy and find a way to attached it to the existing counter weight and it will be excellent so this mic won t play nice with your large condensers pop filters shockmount at the start but just find a good counter weight and all will be well it looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room it was a good investment and all in all you definitely get what you pay for if you re hesitant on attaching a lot of stuff to it then i would recommend shelling out a couple more dollars for a sturdier stand but atleast for me it does the job and does it well
785	what a great little stand i love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings i also like the fact it folds up taking up very little space when its stored away the rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic so there s no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck have to reorder soon great strings for the money i play guitar with a cou ple of my buddies and they love them too sound quaility is great this stand is useful for small instruments fits my tenor uke and violin just fine any bigger than that and the piece that holds the neck becomes too small like a baby martin guitar etc hope this helps i used this tuner as i transitioned from playing rocksmith to playing in the real world my amp had a built in tuner but it seemed to give inconsistent readings with this tuner it doesn t matter if it is electric or acoustic it gives a very very accurate reading my luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it they were only off by units in any given direction very happy and pleased with this one snark tuners are great they are very accurate and are very inexpensive i have now four of them so i can keep one in each guitar case and one for the uke
786	i was having some problems with my ego compressor comp getting noisey sent it back and found out that it had been using a slightly drained battery so i got one of these and it is great nice and quiet again half the price of the boss one these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not i put these s on all of my strats regardless of the brand they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great i tend to play my strats a bit rougher than my gibson s or acoustics so these are well tested in my house i get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit i will continue using these on all of my strats until i find something better which i haven t yet i do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well these are bullet proof they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect after all these reviews i expected the greatest strings ever golden strands of glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection instead i got a decent set of s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup i use a prs with a wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings and i pre stretch them gently but completely plus i tune down to eb for vocal and breakage reasons so i break very few of my normal strings slinky s ergo a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension tuned down is unacceptable especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings as for the tone it s definitely bright and almost too edgy but nicely zingy all told yet one negative i ve noticed after about hours loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings making them harder to tune sounds odd i know but when i replaced the d with a slinky d replacing singles ain t cheap either at triple the price please note i ve since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the elixir strings so i must say i m summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings what s the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast especially when it costs three times more and what s up with the tuning thing and why do these cost so much more anyhow is a micro thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string not when that string is toast in minutes zero doubt there anyhow i ve got five elixirs and one slinky on my main ax now so as they age i ll get a good feel for how the elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone and i ll report back here in a while and by the way that slinky d sounds almost exactly the same as the elixirs tonally so much for magic elixir tone don t get me wrong i really do want to love these as i hate changing strings but geez guys how about some quality control if i m going to pay triple the price then is it crazy to expect triple the quality or heck even just a little better ps if you look at the d addario reviews i love their acoustic strings they respond to many of the reviews and questions i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions edit and now after only six hours of playing on that guitar the b string popped at the same place as the d neck pickup once again i ask what good are strings that sound good three times longer if they break three times faster edit come on after four more hours the a string went i only play that ax one or two sessions a week and the next time i joked to the drummer which one will go today he said he s amazed the g is still on as he plays too and knows the g takes the most tension an hour later guess what yep so that s four broken strings in less than hours play seriously not only are these not a good deal for bucks i d be bummed if they cost bucks the only plus i can think of at this point is they sounded good when new but dang unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such i d stick with slinkies or d addarios unless i got a bad set which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price in any case these elixirs were just not worth the money edit i called elixir and told them about the multiple breakage and they sent me another set that set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet thought the tuning issue remains i ll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud but honestly at this price there should be no duds at all for you get the best good sized heavy duty high quality amp with tons of sound construction solid good material and parts fender used the good stuff sound nice clear loud sound especially for an speaker and w amp you can definitely jam with a drummer no problem or just shred it wearing headphones effects there are amp models i e deluxe metal etc and with these amp sounds to choose from you can apply effects on top of any of the amp models the effects include chorus deep chorus flange tremelo vibration phaser step filter delay ms ms ms reverb large hall small room echo filter octaver etc so what are the presets each of the amp models has been pre programmed with three different presets meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds when you select a preset like the first metal for example the minute you touch the gain knob the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set same with treble bass volume and all other effects the moment you touch any dials or effects knobs you have custom control to tweak each preset just temporarily or save it if you wish it s so great because often i feel i would have made a present slightly more this or that simply grab the gain or change the treble or move from delay to reverb and make it your own very easy ease of use plug in your guitar spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects plug in ipod or computer with mm male cable it s that easy pc software i ve heard their is trouble installing mine said error and did not install on windows i know there are ways to fix this and i will do so when i have some time comes with a usb cable mini for the amp regular plug for the computer works for mac or pc get more presets use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer play on guitar rig and amplitude awesome size perfect big enough to give it a serious look and a quality feel small enough to fit easily under a table next to your desk etc looks like x to me the front metal looking grill is mesh but quality and looks great tuner super simple doesn t tell you which note is in tune just tells you left right or green in center for in tune all in all when compared to the line spider and many other fender amps this one has the quality sound the dozens of different effect combinations input for a footswitch aux for ipod and usb for computer it has it all i jam through headphones for hours each day since i bought it the reverb and gain distortion are so clean and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone my guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp don t sleep on this it s for a loud quality amp with s worth of effects peddles built in and did i mention easily customizable so easy i could teach a year old select a preset change the dials you want to change make changes permanent only by hitting save otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them love this amp and i ve shopped every comparable model this is the one hands down worth a minimum of louder than my friends w d one love fender mustang you rock i generally use d addario with my acoustic guitar only but i decided to try it out on the electric and i am very satisfied it has the same light feel as their acoustic product but it can make all the sweet tones i want it to when hooked up to an amp i m not sure on how long it lasts because i only put them on the guitar a few days ago but they seem just as perfect as they were when i put them on i would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me like many modern capos this has an unwieldy look to it that i don t like but once i get past that this is a top notch capo that is as good as it gets for capos i play several very different stringed instruments guitar mandolin octave mandolin tenor banjo and irish bouzouki and i like having a capo that i can use on all of them this is ideally suited for guitar but holds its own on all the other instruments i particularly like that there s nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way i can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck i really like that fact that it s adjustable and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin i also really like themeideal mcapo bronze guitar banjo mandolin capoas my all purpose capo and i own several of these because they re inexpensive and just a great product but this is definitely my new guitar capo and will replace the meideal in my case great product solidly built and it s a bonus that you can add the micro tuner to the bottom of it the construction appears to be very solid and the finish is a flat black baked on paint or so it appears might be some sort of powder coating as well the top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber and the spring seems very strong with great tension as noted it will accept a d addario micro tuner on the bottom and includes the bracket for mounting it the apogee jam works great and it sounds great the operation is very simple you plug in your guitar and plug in to your mac or ios device i have mine hooked up to my macbook running garage band if there is any latency i can t hear it it works beautifully apogee is known for making good music products and this jam is no exception i was able to plug in a microphone line level into this as well and record my vocals likewise it worked well with my string bass as well i was able to record a whole song in no time for a simple audio interface this is affordable and dependable i installed these on a fender jazz bass with active electronics after stringing them up tuning i immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded i play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played they sounded great all up down the fret board where i really noticed the difference was in recording been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before except for the songs with acoustic bass i will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before i installed these strings i don t play slap or pick bass so i can t say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended
787	these are shred picks they are very accurate pinch harmonics come easily the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze i gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them i did not care for the tone or feel took them off within an hour and put back on ej they had a rough feel and were stiff lots of folks like them but not for me sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever usually i wouldn t notice a significant difference between brands except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears but when i put d addarios on my i just couldn t believe the improvement over the martins it took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear these consistently sound the most balanced and responsive with the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else i m glad the search is over for awhile and i have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here i should have researched this a little bit more it was a gift for a child but a child couldn t tune this thing nor could i it was a toy not an instrument
788	my new guitar had only the back strap connector you can put out over for a button strap holder but for under bucks i decided on this attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head you now have a quick release strap holder very well made strong happy i found this before spending way more than i needed to highly recommend this product joe this holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy it has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something such at the side of back of your instrument so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand i don t know exactly how many it holds and the thickness of the picks makes a difference but i ve crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues i bought these light picks because of the price they work good if your strumming some light rhythms but they tend to be weak and break if your strumming a fast song i guess that s to be expected for a light pick i am not a fussy person about guitar strings they either sound good or they don t to you and you are the one that matters i was very pleased with getting sets at this price delivered to my front door there are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside martin is at the top of the heap these strings sound light and bright very pleased with this purchase this straplock set doesn t come with any instructions that s because it s so easy you don t need them took the original screws off my fender strat set the button screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in afterwards screwed the lock into mygibson lightning bolt style inch safety guitar strap jet blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was ready it is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock won t come loose by accident by any chance still haven t given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes i can tell i made the right purchase way recommended this real leather strap is nice the price is evan better the only thing i should warm if your a extra large person or you have a beer belly then this strap will not fit you
789	cables are cables they usually all work and with amazon you will always find the best deals for the same quality there are other rack screws out there but raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available like title says the item does what it s supposed to you get the headroom you expect from a dollar item i love the ability to have separate control over both inputs i ve had it for a few months and i m experiencing some noise on the pots which i didn t expect i thought it would ve lasted a little longer i can open it and clean the pots but again i expected a little more life out of it battery operation would ve been nice but like i said does what it is supposed to well enough that i ve bought of them to test i installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my s the pad has a larger surface area see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots so i guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area but it s really minimal and i did not notice a huge difference pressure wise the material is nicer softer than the original so that is a plus every so often i would flip the headphones around to see if i could tell anything the larger pad does cover more of the ear almost surrounds it but seriously if you had me blindfolded i wouldn t bet my life that i always knew which side were which but in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up i can t imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time sound difference yes one side in my test sounded better i felt until i switched them around just like eyes your two ears are not equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates i think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it i would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe notice the contradictory reviews more bassy less bassy etc it becomes highly subjective and i wouldn t buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims if you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive if you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but i m glad i didn t pay any more for them than i did from amazon that s my cents i had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s im gonna by me one lol small and unobtrusive just leave it there everytime you play get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you
790	i bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone i was looking for on my week old guitar installed as usual and tuned them they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible my capo could not even hold them i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now use at your own risk i personally wouldn t give a nickel for them very compact size and easy to use good feature for the price shipping is fast very happy for this product best recommended i chose this capo because i was just starting out and needed one for certain songs this was a cheap capo but it does its job well i have no complaints about it at all this product was recommended to me by one of the books i am reading and i must admit i was scared to death when i opened the package my guitar has a built in tuner so i found my room mate s guitar that was totally out of tune and just began tuning i remembered eddie ate dynamite good bye eddie and just tuned away it was easy easy easy and i realized what to do within mere moments money very well spent and highly recommended i have an acoustic electric and it has multiple settings i found what i was comfortable with and just tuned to standard could not be any happier get this product i was excited with how easy it was to set up and it makes my music room look so much better with guitars hanging up instead of just sitting on the floor or on stands
791	i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick it s not a bad pick i will continue to use them but i wish they had a softer center or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers great set of strings cant go wrong with elixirs a little over priced but i am hoping to get long life out of them to make up for it it fits good and came in the color i expected but there was one thing wrong the strap had a small stain i don t know why it said it was brand new but maybe not you get what you pay for this is a no nonsense cheap guitar stand its adjustable padded and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you a stage groupie or your clumsy drummer trip on it the whole mess falls over this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar this is not a good choice for your prized jimi hendrix strat or eric clapton gibson es you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those was looking for something slightly improved over the snark but still easier to use and lower cost than a strobe tuner works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch appears the tuner is a aw and the g guitar function is in that the clip fits a guitar headstock works as anticipated easy to get that last bit of fine tuning good for any guitar even if it is plastic it feel really strong on your guitar neck it is a really good buy
792	i have a fender t bucket acoustic guitar and i put heavy guage strings on it as beginner these strings were not good for me i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings good quality glad i bought these i order of these for my electric guitars they are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range the end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff pleather knock off they were very difficult to get on my guitar pegs not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure these are not coming off anytime soon they are wide enough but do not have any kind of shoulder pad i play sitting down so no big deal to me but if you play standing up these won t be the most comfortable straps all in all they are a decent strap for the price my son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in europe during ww i needless to say i did not want to pass this on to him yet i figured he could start simpler i read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument it has a great tone its construction is solid i am sure this will give him years of entertainment this is not a toy a great addition to your mouth harp collection this amp is small in size but full of sound because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks very responsive very clean sounding this amp is well worth the price i was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only bucks but glad i did this stand is very sturdy well made durable foam padded everywhere guitar touches can be folded for easy transport rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand highly recommended very happy with purchase joe
793	it s comfortable it s adjustable the color was a good match for the guitar unless you regularly gig for hours at a time why spend smackers on a strap when this one does just fine put the dough into the guitar not the strap by several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time this is the one you want it s a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny an investment in your musical future very nice guitar hanger easy to install and it floats away from the wall the back of the guitar never touches the wall if you have an acoustic electric uke this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends beach road trip camping etc it s quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag it s not a great electric amp but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke use a volt when you need it or buy a v ac adapter to plug into an outlet you can t find a better option on a budget when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile quality sound the perfect wall mount for a ukulele my daughter loves it instrument looks great on her wall and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice installs in minutes with included drywall anchors and screws or mount to wall studs i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy
794	this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used i have been a guitarist and bassist for over years and although i have only been playing banjo for a short time this is the most comfortable strap i have ever used the clips look solid and so far they are solid this works better than the qk b model by the same company slim and easy to install though longer than the qk b since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts you might have to rotate a mic boom etc to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand it worked well and i put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag this unit wiggles a little but not as much as the qk b so the little bit of movement is acceptable this looks to be well built and should be reliable the long haul will be the test i use this footer between my guitar pedals and amp i do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new i was initially concerned when i first received the cable that it would not last the cable is not as fat as i had hoped however the ends are solid and sturdily built i usually use mogami gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so if that long this hosa cable is a very good cable and i even chose to use hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals they last i also own an olympus ls this gives me the same recording ability but it is much less expensive you do get the ability to record with four channels which i am dying to try once i get my hands on encoding software also nice and not included with other brands a tripod to hold the unit a handle to use the unit like a microphone charger and earbuds some have noted the zoom doesn t have speakers built in if you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it you need monitors or quality headphones i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls this may be a big issue if you don t treat your equipment carefully time will tell but i have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money i am also looking at the zoom h which will come out in sept this product may actually be the ls killer i bought this tuner for my mandolin i have to play a little louder than i d like for the tuner to hear me the display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays i ve seen but it s so small that i never have to take it off and it s doing its job well i m pretty fond of this little guy this holder grips the ipad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue the rotation to vertical is good but it would be nice if it went both left or right because the arms don t collapse it s a bit bulky to transport in a gear bag but its positive clamping offsets that issue i ve seen some with folding arms that have dropped ipads suddenly because something came loose where i fell down was not ordering the k and m clamp arm that comes as a package under a different order number i ve since seen that arm in use and it would improve the versatility of this unit though the package is pretty spendy i could not order that arm separately i mounted this holder onto a short mic stand by using two mic stand quick releases one for the holder and one for the mic stand boom arm then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag
795	i got it to have it if i needed it i have found that i don t really need it that often and rarely use it if i was really good i can see the need but this is a keyboard not an organ perfect for re stringing your guitar very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings the price was right too this is a must have tool and isn t cheap like most of the plastic ones out there the nice thing about this one is it cuts off excess with ease just looks better trimmed neatly star product i hate string noise and a dirty acoustic this kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body my favorite acoustic guitar is over years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when i am changing chords or fingering the fret board works with any strap for a quick detach system of so you don t have to drill for a strap button to hold your guitar it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar these went on with no problems they have a brassy sound to them since purchasing them they still ring nicely i bought this to replace another adapter that came with the yamaha keyboard i bought at costco long time ago the original adapter was bulky and heavy and that s what caused the wires inside to break tried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together but after short use the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apart when it is big and heavy when you unplug it sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapter but the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip this new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and size it works beautifully the moment i plugged it in btw i am using this not on the cp series it actually works for the cheaper keyboards too my cp has this identical adapter which i tested on the other cheap keyboard before i bought it it s great and shipping was fast
796	takes the edge off the violin sound i keep it on my office violin so i don t disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly my eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin it seems to be accurate and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself fender a sx s jtxk feet performance series guitar cable ig good stereo cable for guitar or keybord it s long enought i recommend it unbelievable clear sounding on a mandolin can t yet get the sound out of a violin that i want with it but still experimenting will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it s connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise all in all very well spent thank goodness pickup prices are coming down only a few years ago you could not find a pickup mic even this good for now if only the price of pickup chics would come down works perfectly got the drivers for mac from the website and it instantly showed up in core audio very easy to use love it
797	i use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp which is in a soundproof box the cord is reliable and clean sounding i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence excellent cord hopefully this review will be usefull to you this product is a must why because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure i ve owned numerous straplok systems on the various bass guitars i ve owned and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system i really like the mediums they are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough perfect perfect size weight shape i like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds recommended i like ernie ball strings they are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands i tried i change strings every two weeks i tried the rest and returned to the best my guitar strap was old i replaced it with this one as i didnt want to head into town is black and no frills perfect for remote recoding with up to head sets clean amp and plenty of gain at a great price not very bright not very flexible too big clunky i really don t like it i wish i had went in a different direction these mics are great i wasn t sure what they would be like but i would buy them all again they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time these have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all good quality cable actually much better than i expected for the price i don t move around much so i don t know about how rugged it would be out on the road but the cable is flexible and should stand up to a lot of rolling and unrolling it s not an entire bridge assembly but it s exactly what i needed in my opinion it is worth the money i use to protect my microphones of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone very good product i recommend
798	i will start with saying this is not a class tube amp meaning all tube in the pre ampand the amplifier sections i will also say that if you can find one used buy it it is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp ipurchased this amp about years ago and love it the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp it uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid watts of sound the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube i am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web this amp has two channels one clean classic blackface tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in effects and different amplifier voices you can purchase a foot switch for about that enable you switch between channelone and channel two the amp also has a speaker out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker there is also a line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop the amplifier use three tubes x ax and x v s it s speaker is a inch ohm special design fender if you want to get louder fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a eminence rajin cajun you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think some players are comfortable with the stock speaker with regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods this is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that i will say that the clean channel is very nice whether i play through my gibsons or myfender tele i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp it will breakupwhen you dial up to about or on the master the digital voicing processor dsp from what i read from more experienced players arepretty darn close to the original voices like tweed british think vox jangle fenderhot rod metal an acoustic super clean tone optimized for finger picking there is alsoa clean jazz tone that has the character of the fender jazz king amplifier again i amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices with regard to the effects vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic it is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want authentic if you want or need a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp it weighs only pounds kg so it s portability is very good this ampwas a wonderful deal at when i originally bought it in it is still a good dealtoday if you can find one used takes you hours to play around with all the sounds built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage nice and loud in a small package well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions pretty much what i expected much more relaxed at higher volumes than the m definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the m will have to reduce the mids a bit via the fuse editor although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy this is of course via the front panel only i m sure it can be done using the fuse editor it s supposed to be lbs heavier than the m but it sure doesn t feel like it i keep looking at the m fiendishly wondering if there s a way to shoehorn a speaker in there for the most part the patches created in the m translated pretty well after the required firmware update needing just a few adjustments here and there i m appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as i won t have to crank the bass control as much as i have to on the m that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp more from editing via fuse here are a few of the things that i found and liked the deluxe model sounds better with the deluxe s cab and vice versa the has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the s cab while the model s propensity to break up sooner works better with the s less sparkly cab the also seems to have more low end girth the twin is a bit too icepick y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the bassman s cab the supersonic s cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds i use that have a bit more gain it s good for keeping things from getting too buzzy it s a very fat sounding cab sim both the m and seem to respond really well with my tex mex pickups i have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet my other guitar has mini humbuckers but somehow i get the feeling that i won t like it as much as i do with the strat i think this is understandable though since fender has always been all about the single coils i m not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on so far for bucks i couldn t ask for more constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp it is not nearly as heavy as i would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together controlsthe iii comes with a button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly you can expand to add an optional button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets the controls are intuitive and easy to use it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs comparing to other amps the fender gdec does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line vox and peavy have offered in the past all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects but how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them line offers tons of sounds most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what i find with line is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little inch champ tons of character and tone you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model think the jimi blues cd the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing fender bassman wow you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end with some singing highs deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps they are all bold and in your face just play one acdc riff into the s amp and you ll recognize the sound as far as the vintage tones go i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good i was wrong the s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model this is certainly your metallica amp the metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones you can have one guy who sets all presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash it is limitless i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar they all sound very cool on this amp the classic vibe s strat really impresses me through this amp so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound i am really loving it this amp can play really really loud with it s watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes i have kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse the system is super easy to use and store on your amp as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well but you will find some gems too i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later the final wordi am a father of who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones i hate overprocessed guitar tones this amp is perfect for me perfect the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased i have a strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it there is no better modeling amp for my needs
799	i love this mic as an indoor studio mic i would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omni directional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise but when the conditions are quiet like in a studio this mic rocks clean warm sound that picks up natural bass really well good for vocals singing or instruments like a guitar or piano also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that too comes with a db limiter db switch right on the mic works really nicely at limiting background noise i would highly recommend this especially at the price comes with a decent hard case and sweet shock mount very happy overall can t complain about a price like this does the job just fine for what it is not really anything more you could ask for comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most if not all microphones folds up nice and small happy all around i received a pair of these two weeks ago and am happy with my purchase they seem well put together and just feel nice they also came with two velcro ties each with proper care i m confident these cables will last a very long time awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer this filter is awesome and for the price can t get any better
800	i ve been using the d addario strings for about years now us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings little known fact in the industry their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry after plus years of playing d addario rocks just be aware that the ends are so big that some vertical input boxes like my danelectro fish and chips can t be used with these cables because the input and output are too close together and that s a good thing i wanted a tuner pedal that i could use under any lighting condition my previous experience with korg equipment made the pitchblack a no brainer there s not much i can say that hasn t already been said except true bypass is nonsense if your tone sucks when a device is not on then the problem is somewhere else not in the effect if you want to talk about unity gain on the other hand i m all ears
801	wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh some people pay for silver and expect gold okay so i bought this because i do app review videos for a blog and my blue snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard p hard t hard b s and a few others so i got this here are my pros and cons pros it works i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter the pop sound is completely removed with the filter which means it does what it was designed to do stars it does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech d it looks nice attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product it doesn t really matter since i work from home and not in a public place but it s nice to know i can show it to people and it looks nice the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface so mounting this to say a desk probably won t be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic i don t know why people think this isn t sturdy i mean you re not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing the build quality is quite excellent considering that it s fragile screens attached to plastic and metal cons it s pretty big i used to shorten the stem on my blue snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage i can t do that anymore with this pop filter on it now it s become a permanent member of the front of my desk outside of this thing doubling the space my snowball takes up i have no complaints about this pop filter it works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good this should be the last pop filter i have to buy for a long time it s a pick everyone has their preference but i happen to like the s a lot and the powder y grip on these is a real bonus it take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are clean as well don t let the term nylon fool you this is a really nice thick strap nothing like those cheap straps a great value and it matches my guitar that has a cool retro s pinstripe flame paintjob it s a very solidly made stand simple to assemble perfect for my home studio holding my key midi controller keyboard i m very happy with the purchase and the price was right this is a good looking strap much lighter and thinner then any strap that i have had it has to be half the weight of others but that makes it very comfortable looks great on my blond tele the price is right as well i like it i needed this for my jazzmaster that has a front face input sounds fine although that guitar is notably humm y with the single coils i don t feel this cable added any more noise in the line looks cool and sounds good to me and great price i actually bought i like this pedal its rugged and has a great range of tonal capabilities and rips for hardcore metal that being said the blue led while cool looking is actually blinding and i found myself placing a finger over it to just see the friggin knobs for adjustments i guess that is a pretty weak complaint but imo it s an impediment more than an enhancement also the gate and scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me which is not expected at this price point a moot point because i am not using the gate at least as imo it was weird in its gating execution sounded kind of like a very rough algorithm is being used instead of a nice smooth curve but all in all this thing tears it up in terms of pure shredding tone this pedal i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin wow it cranks it really will produce marshall plexi tones especially noticeable in the lower registers on the e and a strings if you want a marshall stack sound this is it if you wanty a variety i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions so you can chose any amp sound you need really people for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make and they all are super jf omfg no need to get all ocd about emptying your full wallet to get the tone needed i tried this on strats an lp a harrington through my slightly modded vc webber speakers tube amp clean channel no hum noisiness built solid the english instructions aren t really useful as the pedal itself is self explanatory i m possibly half deaf but have been doing this for years i ll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens there are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it your attitude and hands create the sound in the end a pedal does not make you play better practice does if you are familiar with the ocd or can get one and a b side by side it you ll be amazed cool looking pedal box to boot
802	if you re buying this and new to effects pedals like i was you ll be concerned whether it ll work with the inexpensive pedals you re likely to also be buying especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you ll need them the two most common types of inexpensive pedals are danelectro and behringer and if you re like me they re ll you ll buy for quite a while the good news is you do not need to buy converters for them this little beauty will run all your behringer and danelectro pedals off from any of the standard v power supplies available you don t need to buy a spot i use it with a behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less expensive planet wave if you re working on an even tighter budget in short buy this product it will save you its cost in v batteries within the first two months if you re on low price pedals looks great feels great and works great the leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely great i love it i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a spot brand plug it is not what i received instead i received a generic plug for eight v connections that would definitely fit the purpose but a really cheap version the plugs on this generic version are larger than the spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic the original spot plug has much smaller plugs great for saving space on a pedal board and the wires are soft and rubbery again making it easier to work with on a pedal board specially if you re working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the spot plug to make sure there would be no mistake but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original spot plug wouldn t know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight v connectors i strongly recommend spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original spot plug amazing i plugged this little gadget into my strat put on my headphones and wow i was super surprised the sound is amazing you can adjust the amount of gain and volume to fine tune your sound whether your playing through humbuckers or single coils i love the sound i get on either my strat or les paul best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody i plug this little monster into my compressor and from the compressor to the guitar and the sound is amazing i really like the sound and the fact that it is totally portable and independent of power runs on two aaa batteries the digital delay effect is activated independently same little switch just one extra click which is fine but you can t adjust the speed or mix that s ok though because the factory setting works just fine if you want a touch of delay all in all i highly recommend this vox amplug lead guitar headphone amp for its sound and price one small con its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile i m an enthusiastic amateur which means i care about my gear but it s not my living i buy the best gear i can afford but i can t go all mogami for every cable i need planet waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior can pay these sound good by that i mean they don t have any sound at all and are made well the design is such that they will wear well i m very pleased with these good cords with a decent length i like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box i order the longer cord to go to my wah pedal which i always set outside of my pedal board works quite well if you have a trem system on your guitar these bullet ends really do transfer tone energy through the trem block for sustain i added a big block and these strings and it has really brought my strat to life highly recommended this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined i would recommend to get a few roles of power grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcros included in most pedal boards and a one meter roll around feet wont last long especially if you have a combination of both regular size mxr or boss and bigger pedals like a cry baby wah or a vox satchurator or time machine reverb or similar you probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals even rare ones so this would be great for you to keep them well attached to your board and properly organized maybe the tape could be made a bit wider perhaps an inch more would be great it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface still a great product concept a must buy
803	wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh some people pay for silver and expect gold okay so i bought this because i do app review videos for a blog and my blue snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard p hard t hard b s and a few others so i got this here are my pros and cons pros it works i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter the pop sound is completely removed with the filter which means it does what it was designed to do stars it does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech d it looks nice attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product it doesn t really matter since i work from home and not in a public place but it s nice to know i can show it to people and it looks nice the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface so mounting this to say a desk probably won t be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic i don t know why people think this isn t sturdy i mean you re not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing the build quality is quite excellent considering that it s fragile screens attached to plastic and metal cons it s pretty big i used to shorten the stem on my blue snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage i can t do that anymore with this pop filter on it now it s become a permanent member of the front of my desk outside of this thing doubling the space my snowball takes up i have no complaints about this pop filter it works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good this should be the last pop filter i have to buy for a long time i got this for my epi sheraton ii pros it fits perfectly it s fur lined and has a decent sized internal compartment it s solid and the hardware is sturdy it has one locking latch out of five but nothing that would stop a real thief it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground it s relatively thin cons it s heavy the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle it has some made in china characteristics i ve had several cases and this is one of the nicest on a personal level i d prefer it didn t say epiphone on the outside but since it does it s a good place to hide a gibson this are some great strings i have bought them my last times and i will continue to buy them i like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar the tone is much bettter too i have it for more than months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome i have another tuner which is set eadgbe that is much easy to tune without any confusion although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently it s confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left right or more however it s a bonus for using the tuner and i don t have to bring all to the classes for the metronome which is my initial purpose to purchase it it s great and have enough adjustable calibration beats rhythms and tempos for practices this didn t exactly fit my mxl v g condenser mic so i took out the bottom piece which took a little work then i was able to get the bottom screw plug of my mic to fit it s solid and works well for the money this thing sounds just fine i got it for my son to toy around with he barely ever uses it but the times it s been plugged in it puts out pretty good sound for the price
804	there isn t much to say about this product except it works as advertised if you don t have one of these and you are a live performer i highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up pun intended small light and stays out of the way it just works folds up if needed for travel i use with stratacoustic this is a very very nice guitar strap comes with dual locking strap holes on each end very nice for creating a great grip on your guitar so they won t fall off i originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one very good for the price i ve used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity to use these you put your strap on your guitar as usual then put the locks on rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap once the lock has passed the head of the guitar s strap button rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up close position which should be about degrees from open position very simple and works very well i have not used any lock system that s perfect every one that i ve used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly these work exceptionally well what i like about this design is that it doesn t require any modifications on the guitar or the strap you can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you don t have to replace the guitar s existing strap buttons but they do stick out a bit to keep the strap from sliding off so if you re concerned about looks you might want to try another system that s more discreet also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends these will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons no moving parts no high tech components the ultimate in low tech it s a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose i find this size useful but i guess it depends on the individual s needs enough said
805	working great on my stratocaster excellent purchase feels good to switch positions solid and quiet i should ve bought this to replace the original switch from the start fender guitars are made for tinkering they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws at any given time i have a fender guitar taken apart and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws i inevitably lose don t get me wrong i am a die hard fenderista but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects not fine examples of the luthier s art that s what makes them so much fun to play and modify i was a little disappointed don t know if it s a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of pots was out of spec k and were almost out k k was right on the money and the other were within they are ctl s so i m a bit confused other than that they work fine they have the nut washer and cap included no knob i will be upgrading the caps not much to screw up good quality parts on an essential product brain dead simple install and no surprises works like a champ my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions this is the neatest little light i have ever seen it takes aaa batteries included but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out and has nice leds the lights are bright enough for my something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand battery life so far has been at least hours actually probably hours as my daughter has been using the light also i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable a real needed item is you play in darker rooms it is a fender product so it is well made reasonably priced it will make any strat or tele build shine
806	i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these they fit great and plenty of screws i am going to replace all my old screws with these fender quality is just a step above the competition and worth the extra money over cheaper generic products worked perfectly for my latest guitar project these knobs fit well on the pots in my strat and they match the color of the black fender pickguard as well they look nice work well were easy to replace and do the job what more could you ask of strat knobs great guitar strings and affordable i have used these for quite a while and i have always liked them recently i moved to boston though and here they seem to rust really quickly they never used too its not that humid here so i don t know if i got some bunk strings or if the quality has gone down in the last year or if really its the boston weather historically i have sworn by these though very nice quality part fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed but my mexi strat is now complete promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up but overall a very nice part compliments my b w b pickgaurd nicely open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes normally found spent next to nothing on this part but it saved the day on a side project for a friend thank god i buy spares this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly it doesn t get any more elemental but i soldered it in and it s doing fine not for real heavy usage anyway i think a set of five is a bit overkill since i only needed three but these are a direct replacement for the originals excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic squire strat series this bridge has more strength and solidness than the original replace the tremelo arm with the one offered on amazon as well key this bridge is slightly thicker higher than the one it replaces on the squire so the back plate won t fit back on something to mod if you need a backplate but the difference in the quality make it worth the loss yep i said it better than a tubescreamer this pedal has a wider gain range far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid s screamer the only thing it seems to lack is the smooth creaminess of an old but i can easily live with that this is an amazing ts clone and for the price cant be beat
807	i read the reviews on ernie ball strings i have to say that i love the strings they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar these went on with no problems they have a brassy sound to them since purchasing them they still ring nicely i ve had an old beginner ukulele sitting in a closet for years i have much nicer ones now and decided that rather than lend them out for playing i d fix up this beginner uke as a loaner i took off the strings and realized how dull and dry looking the fret board had become i used this product and it really soaked it up fast now it looks beautiful again very satisfied with how it worked these are great strings and were my favorite until i found fender pure nickel strings some may like the sound of these some may like the pure nickel these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used my main complaint is the very small size i haven t got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick i find the dava master control more to my liking for most things but i still use the jazz iii s from time to time when i just want a simple clean pick tone those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar furthermore they are very accurate as well so worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time i want to change tunings bottom line inexpensive well made accurate time saving buy it now
808	liked this capo it worked fine you can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension this is a quality stand i use it for my yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great nothing but praise for this item item came with two sets of screws a long set and a shorter set looks good on my yamaha acoustic guitar holds my strap well i am happy i bought this
809	i ve only been playing ukulele for about years so i m new to using a capo it seems to hold tight i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele it s attractive it s well made it s fork is a tad large for the ukulele it has rubber o rings that slide so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then but then even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase or wall if you use it there the uke hits when i put it in the hanger so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners this is much less expensive holds very well is even more low profile than this hanger and never drops a uke consider it for your needs i d not buy another of these for a ukulele it likely works fine for a guitar though i deducted one point for the fact that even though it s adjustable the o rings and advertised for ukes it doesn t work well for them and it s heavy and not stylish in my opinion i have the hercules wall hanger mechanical gripper for my electric guitars and it s fabulous for guitars overkill for lightweight ukuleles maybe hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp wbupdate the more i use it the less i like it i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune so for small instruments you d have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos this is atrocious for guitars it s not as good as hercules i love these hanging hercules guitar hangers the work wonderfully when you place your guitar into the hanger little supports turn in to each other creating a safe secure hanger works great in studs drywall and stucco with the correct hardware of course this is a cheaply built cable it has basic ends they screw on but seem to come loose and need tightening frequently the only truly redeeming feature of this cable is it s tiny length feet i use it with my honey tone belt portable ampdanelectro n a honey tone mini amp in aqua so the cable has to be short the amp is on my belt i use it thus just like jackson and cole reviewers below like jackson i have a risa solid body electric ukulele let me say three feet is short very short if you want to put the amp down on the floor you d better be a short and b siting right over it because when you find out how limiting three feet cable really is you ll recognize that you can only use this for one thing a portable amp close to or on your body i suppose you could use it to connect a couple of guitar pedals and not have too much cable but them again most connector cables are even shorter glad i have it only for the purpose i intended wish it was heftier stronger better looking like my other guitar cables if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you i was hesitant at first but this did the job i bought an ibanez concert size uke the body is inches wide less than the inches stated for this stand my uke does not fit well in the stand why the twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke thus any uke that is concert size or greater so most ukes don t fit well they fit just not well i did and you will likely need this advice remove the bottom fork turn it upside down and reinstall it no tools required now the curve of it is upward and the uke better sits on it the fit is improved not great but better one stand can t fit all instruments but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars this small stand does not hold most all ukes although its neat how it folds up like the video here on amazon reviews it is very heavy for its size this is not a lightweight stand at all surprisingly heavy and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag trust me i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs b mini stand all hercules stuff is superb and my friend has one for his uke and says it s sublime i don t own it myself so i just present this so you can research it and it s reviews on amazon i own other herc stuff and it s all ideal and for a few bucks more i could have had that lifelong use stand instead of this one oh well for once i got cheap and got burned for it all in all not great this tiny stand one stand fits not all perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments you may think you can bend the lower forks but it s hard to do will require a vice and if you see on the amazon pictures the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves so if you splay it out like it should be you ll change the way it fits in the grooves and thus it won t work at all it s just an imperfect design my take on it your mileage may vary bye bye i have snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners see my reviews when i use my music stand i just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job this is that device i leave it on my stand and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger and it s on and i can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the snark head tuners in addition this one has a metronome i like this very much and may well buy another enjoy the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles i just got one and have used it for a few days and it s the bomb i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over this product is a rubber disc with small arms in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface and you can set your instrument against it and voila it doesn t fall over here at home i use it on the second shelf of a bookcase and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove heel on carpet neck in guitar rest i m going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases because i can use them at one of my uke parties if one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor for instance to take a whizz they re just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them here i just find a spot near wherever i m sitting and it becomes my lean spot and i can even set my beer can on the round part on the back coaster uke guitar holder it s quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument i could carry a metal stand with me but it wouldn t fit in my ukulele case this planet waves product does a winner
810	sounds like my original enough said great pedal and it is still built like a tank i do appreciate that on this version one can use a pretty standard ac adapter a clayton s rule been using since they debuted and will never change to anything else long lasting and great tone besides awesome yes indeed khjghjjh hgkjhgk it is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too it stands as it should and it was a snap literally to set up it was like three steps or something wow i am very impressed considering the price this gator case is very good i m use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one the strings sound great on my full size acoustic nice bright but warm tone full bodied sound but not so great on my size guitar these are good i dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range they all work well length of being brillant is somewhat limits but it appears to be in most of these level of strings i ve tried several different strings on electric and ernie ball slinkys are the only ones i really trust on all of my guitars the fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus but they sound great and are far less prone to breakage than other brands i have tried the s are super fast and easy to bend but i ve started using s more often on my strats which creates an even more robust sound they re an industry standard for a reason you don t need dollar strings these strings are different and really quite nice the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings i really like them only possible difficulty is that high e etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string i have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my epiphone as well the standard earnie balls it is a basic music stand but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements you can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store great value i really like this guitar stand it was worth the extra money it securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it very stable base the bottom which holds the guitar can be switched over for different size bases of guitars a good price a good buy glad i invested in it by the way i read several reviews which said this had a smell to it mine does not i just wonder what other people have encountered i am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide this one works fine so far it is rather heavy and i like that i also like that because it is metal if you drop it on the floor it is not going to break like my glass one did be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger works very well i have to of them each does a little different thing they are great for traveling or late night need to play stuff when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better the sound effects etc are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication works amazingly so far i am definitely proud of this product will be buying more in the future great buy great for carrying with you works as it should good price i would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot i really like this tuner it works very well once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner ie the moving black squares to no longer move then tuning is a simple and accurate thing it works great on all of my guitars acoustic and electric comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it it cause a few bucks but i think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons that it is worth it i have two delay pedals both inexpensive this one and a behringer and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap behringer the danelectro sounds more natural the behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal which is perfectly ok for some applications the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos the case is plastic but unless you eat times your weight at the golden corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet you re not going to break it the only thing i don t like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it i suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the retro look of this pedal ok fine i ve heard pedals costing twice as much that don t sound as nice as this one as one reviewer once wrote there are guitarists who would rather catch aids than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board i however think some of these cheap pedals function quite well and in some cases just as well as their more expensive counterparts if you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your holy grail ocd and other boutique pedals i promise the other ones won t catch aids from this in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
811	this is the mic you should get recording or live instruments or voice it always come through with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects can t believe it took me so long to get one of those other than that when you need rack screws these are the real mccoy wide enough pan to grab the ear narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear thanks raxxess i think this patch looks cool on the bass i don t really hear any difference in sound but does give your drum head a better life span wow haha this china really packs a punch haha i got this china and was blown away by it my band loves it the crowds love it and most importantly it is very loud and trashy great for hardcore drummers best price and overall value compared to the name brands this product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more this is an overpriced item that is my only complaint there s enough reviews on here that state the obvious it is small it sounds good and can keep up with a little jazz trio by itself which is amazing however i have to say i m super uber pissed that the day after i bought this amp at sam ash for it dropped to about how does an amp just come down half price over night i mean what kind of scam was this company running if they can afford to stay in business and sell them half the price than they were originally marked at it s like the blue blocker sunglasses on tv they re sold for months later you can get them in the barging bin for at cvs this is not ethical business this is trying to get as much as you can from your customers with no regard to true value ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors edit just read another guy who gives it stars because it can be used as a weapon to knock someone out not sure if this amp deserves the stars it is getting and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley i stand by my logically opinions of this item zt should not have sold this for in the first place it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name
812	this set is not for everyone in fact you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set while i can see rockers laying down overpowering riffs with these my goal is to get the lowest action i can on a jazz box no question about the quality though these hold up the same fine standards as the other slinky sets i wouldn t recommend tuning these strings to e however because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to e can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix the highest i feel comfortable tuning these to is e flat if you are doing anything at or below drop c sharp these strings will work out great for you these perform well on single coils specifically telecasters right now i switch back and forth between power and beefy with fenders being my next choice followed by d addario there are some things in this life that you don t want to have to think about and your tuner is one of them you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board it is true bypass and doesn t add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all your brand preference will guide your decision but don t shy away from this well made piece of equipment i would buy it again these picks are bigger than i expected easy to hold and very soft they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks this pedal provides the classic octave distortion i sought after for the price and product quality you can t go wrong with this one and the functionality is great use it as a fuzz distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic jimi hendrix like tones and harmonics
813	for a microphone at amazon may not be the best mic out there but for home studios this one marks the spot get it if you re on a budget i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording practice having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere it works fine it is lightweight and feels sturdy only drawback i tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass and the preamps saturated in low frequencies input has to be kept within a small range i ve been using this product for a while now only for indoor really light use so i can t speak to it s durability at this time but i like it because it s cheap light and it works behringer may be cheap but they do create some good products for this one it s a hit and miss although i ordered three of them
814	although it is touted for acoustic guitars it works well with my ibanez electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic electric the spring is tough and it holds securely on and off is a quick process if you have the hand finger strength to operate it i rate it stars only because i just received it and haven t had a chance to use it much but i like it so far it was delivered quickly it does the job i ll update after i ve had it for awhile a snug fit for the pod hd knocked one star off because the weight distribution is a little awkward when using the strap on my shoulder i ve been using this brand of strings for years the super slinkys sound great the gauge is very easy to bend and on a good guitar will also sustain well they last a long time if you wipe down after use better yet get the big bends string cleaning wipes to increase the life of your strings getting a proper pedal power unit like voodoo labs dc brick ciok is recommended even though this has a lot of outlets each pedal may not receive enough power i usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok any more than that and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals may not power some pedals that have a high current draw i bought this boost to use in one specific situation when playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down my volume drops quite dramatically this boost does what it says it will do to remedy that but it also seems to add a lot of noise when the boost is off my super high gain fryette deliverance is very quiet when i just hold my hand over the strings i m using a lp custom with a stock r pick up in the neck and t in the bridge when i turn on the boost i immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise when playing it isn t so bad but i definitely am not used to so much extra noise there are a couple of adjustment switches inside and i haven t fooled with those yet but i m definitely going to do that this boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound but if you ve already got pro quality stuff i don t see too much of an advantage here for any usable tones while playing live the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring i didn t like the recorded tones either much rather preferred amplitube if micing a real tube amp wasn t an option that being said it is good for practice and song writing used this for more than a year and finally sold it that s the other thing with items like this they lose value real quick once the next version comes out awesome little tuner very accurate and i can store it almost anywhere much cheaper online too for the price its a steal i have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound i want boss digital delay i really didn t like the sound of the delay overall no real positives to mention carbon copy analog delay worked great for cleans but totally muddied up my lead distortion tone even though it was in my fx loop i couldn t get the repeats to duck under the main signal nova delay i really wanted to like this presets tap tempo and a nice feature set but the sound just lacked warmth it was very digital soundingat this point i wasn t sure what i wanted analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy digital delays were clear sounding but just too digital and uninspiring i was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline when i found this pedal analog dry signal thru with digital delay this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved set it to the type delay and its perfect sure it doesn t have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay this can t be beat at this price range sure enough when i checked the strymon timeline specs i found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set but for a delay pedal is just too much for me buy this if you are chasing tone you won t be disappointed skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc
815	good quality one i like the big size type would like to have a thinner one so far so good nice works and no problem sound is good packaging is good so far the so good used for almost a month now dunlop pick holder this is very handled always forget were my pick got off too now i know my picks is in the holder hangs my guitar around my neck so i don t have to hold it there easily adjusted looks nice the pick pocket is handy this is one of the best simple to use guitar tuners i ve used and i ve used a lot of them the bonus is that it s also one of the least expensive that i ve seen you won t be disappointed
816	as the title says it works the only reason i took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and i have to use some force to get it off the xlr but no issues besides that good all around mike if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio i recommend this one best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals best mike for the price and purpose this is a great addition to any stereo system today assuming you still use your turntable two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play free of any annoying pops or clicks it won t save a dirty record you ll have to buy a cleaning solution for that but this brush will easily take care of dust hair and other particles that get attracted to your lps during regular use as another reviewer suggested i do the first pass with the brush going with the record as if i was spreading out paint or something like that and that gets most of the surface particulate free the second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record after that your record will sound brand new again there are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options but none that are this easy and this cheap i purchased the dr for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs and it accomplishes that very well the battery life is great the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it and the build quality is pretty solid my only issue is the internal mics while crystal clear in terms of quality can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things in addition they are very susceptible to wind even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air i highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery i ll start off by saying that i ve had this interface for about months now and it is still going strong i think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit not only does it provide channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out this could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio however i have a few gripes with the i the headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls imo the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aesthetics why stars the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it anyways shortly after i engaged the v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away i hope that this issue does not show up in all of the scarlett i interfaces i would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios hopefully just my unit is defective and it isn t something that is common among the i s another thing to note is that while direct monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use in other words i am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though so in the end stars the packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that i really like the build quality of the interface and focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit the only issue that i would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged overall great entry level interface sound card
817	i think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preamp i plugged it into my daw and listened on my krks and was impressed by its sound the overdrive is quite good no it can t hold a candle to my j rockett pedals alan holdsworth signature overdrive but at it s an absurdly good buy used this foot pedal for a and so far i ve had know problems replaced the battery only once good product for a inexpensive foot pedal the eminence patriot cannabis rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker i ve ever heard period this does not mean that it s dull sounding or muffled at least not if you hearing is still good i hesitated quite a bit before i decided to buy it and install it in my fender mustang ii but my worries were for naught incredibly it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds yet for overdrive sounds there is very little fuzziness just a big full and fat sound that s articulate without being buzzy if you play metal you ll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy classic rock and jazzy sounds this is a speaker to seriously consider i turned my mustang ii into an open back combo and the cannabis rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed i had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps it never got shrill or piercing just buttery smooth and clear it s also much more efficient than the stock speaker at db w m i don t know how eminence did it but i love it i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle this mixing board didn t look that impressive to me when i first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus the fact that it does not have an on off switch is a minus but basically it works well the eq is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer behringer makes a range of models with less more inputs to suit one s needs so this is great also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything well i would have liked some of these things but then i would have to pay more and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far by the way i am running the following through the mixer an at audiotechnica condenser mic an alesis qs guitar via line in or mic d two krk rp studio monitors presonus firebox everything s been working and sounding great thus far the effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me since i am running logic but if i ever use it live which i may do i d imagine they d come in handy the effects are just so so in terms of sounds usable but not that great in my opinion i ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly it arrived in a large box and within in the fender amp box i guess boxes is good as it provides more protection sadly when i tried to use them amp it didn t work i checked the wall plug cord flicked several switches and knobs but still didn t work needless to say i sent the amp back to amazon which was quick and painless i wanted an exchange i expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me but i was shocked to find out that as soon as the return ups label was recorded at the ups store they shipped out another amp and it arrived in days since i returned the first one wow that s customer service the amp is great small footprint sounds great for what i want it for which is bedroom basement practice amp does it s job very nicely i explored the fuse software and the potential is almost endless honestly i don t think i will every fully utilize the full capability of the fuse software i just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there i may use someone else s uploaded presets and play with the various options later on in summary stars for the amp and stars for the customer service well just got it plugged in and here are some initial impressions pretty much what i expected much more relaxed at higher volumes than the m definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the m will have to reduce the mids a bit via the fuse editor although it has less overall sparkle that also translates to smoother highs i was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy this is of course via the front panel only i m sure it can be done using the fuse editor it s supposed to be lbs heavier than the m but it sure doesn t feel like it i keep looking at the m fiendishly wondering if there s a way to shoehorn a speaker in there for the most part the patches created in the m translated pretty well after the required firmware update needing just a few adjustments here and there i m appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as i won t have to crank the bass control as much as i have to on the m that of course translates to more headroom for the power amp more from editing via fuse here are a few of the things that i found and liked the deluxe model sounds better with the deluxe s cab and vice versa the has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the s cab while the model s propensity to break up sooner works better with the s less sparkly cab the also seems to have more low end girth the twin is a bit too icepick y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the bassman s cab the supersonic s cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds i use that have a bit more gain it s good for keeping things from getting too buzzy it s a very fat sounding cab sim both the m and seem to respond really well with my tex mex pickups i have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet my other guitar has mini humbuckers but somehow i get the feeling that i won t like it as much as i do with the strat i think this is understandable though since fender has always been all about the single coils i m not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on so far for bucks i couldn t ask for more this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside upon receiving mine and assembling it it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static non oscillating chorus like effect it s fine for that as an actual pitch shifter though this thing is awful all the pitch shift settings sound like they re cents sharp this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it it s hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is i ve read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i m also tempted to get their green mile pedal if you re not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i ve tried to use i had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack it never sounds thumpy or unnatural but always musical i really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like
818	i enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks as it was interesting to try different models dunlop picks are great the snark tuner is thebest one i have owned extremely accurate easy to use very reasonably priced for such a good piecehave paid lots more for products that were harder and not as accurate this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable i ve tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments i use electric guitar acoustic guitar mandolin violin and banjo this one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport it doesn t get in the way has rubber feet and padding and just works simply and effectively it s not flashy looking but then it s never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument or blends in because of its compact size and black color nothing else is as versatile and effective including the multi instrument stands the ones with other shapes of the support arms and other folding designs this is simply the ideal
819	it s a little harder to open than other capos i ve used but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it it s not cheap and flimsy though i don t see this one wearing down anytime soon now stop reading this review and buy this capo you wont regret it i like the product i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost i thought that it could hold a few more picks i think i putted about picks in it but hey it works and i would buy it again i forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar thats what i did it looks good and durable also it s cheap a simple device yet so useful i hate changing strings without one anymore dunlop provided an inexpensive winder that s durable this item was received well packed and on time provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks the bag is simple canvas it probably won t protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack however the stands are sturdy fully adjustable and look professional works like a capo nothing much to add my son searched for the odd colors so he could see his capo while on stage in near darkness small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little i wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my sony and korg plug in tuners it clips onto the guitar easily stays put and is not intrusive by weight or size the bars are easy to see and are accurate my only complaint is that it doesn t seem as accurate as some traditional tuners but that s probably by design so you aren t fiddling over fractions of a semitone when you re trying to tune your guitar between songs sets
820	i have many lengths of these hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them i am not an active musician so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage so i cannot comment on thistype of usage in my over years of them on stage i have come to realize thatyou should always have extra cables just like strings with you aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down i used to use elixir nano string and a good as they sound they do not last these do great sounding strings i have used these strings for years and this was a great price shipping time was good a little small for my taste very thin but works well and dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician this is my first real recording microphone i really like it i use it to record vocal with my home studio setup and it does a good job for the multi guitar owners i think this is great all i was looking for something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tone volume changes set up single coil and another line humbucker or p guitar and have the same volumes excellent and space saver sure there s a lot more options but not likely ill use just to make guitar switching easy good deal i bought this to upgrade from a eurorack that i had i m quite please with the xenyx lots of inputs phantom power and it produces really great sound i m very happy with this little mixer this is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast especially if you are using any of the xenyx or other behringer brand mixers it also works with other mixers as well this is a great inexpensive way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me unfortunately i wasn t aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when i need the large the medium fits over my pinky finger and while that s okay i prefered it fit over my index finger where i d have more control i cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so i ll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger dunlop slide
821	restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle a great investment that ll last quite a long time i can t say i m a polish connoisseur but this stuff seems to work very well it shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks i m not very diligent in my guitar maintenance so this bottle should last me for years it s a button it s not fancy it s silver it screwed into my ukulele with no problem and it works very well this strap is comfortable has plenty of room to expand it to fit and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele and even the extra thin travel ukes i really like it but it s a real step up from the effects on my vox mini amp so i m only going to complain too much it actually cost more than the behringer amp i m running it through which seems a little odd to me i just play at home with friends it works well so far on all my ukuleles however every time you touch your instrument it s going to transmit that sound into your amp so it s nothing i d be using on stage if i didn t have to still it seems to be a good value but truth be told i haven t had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue time will tell the action was a little high for my taste the strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible why do they sell an instrument with crap strings that is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument otherwise it s well built and works really it s a three and a half star imo it s not as nice sounding or as playable as my mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings however i have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching usually i do my bad what a good buy this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice luv the zip pocket in the front perfect for strap snark capo whatever bought this for my hubby s tenor uke and one just like it tho smaller for my concert uke highly recommend
822	these cables have taken a beating the last few months and have served me well with no problems real metal ends not molded on with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors great capo i ve tried a lot of other capos including some pretty expensive brand name capos and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings it may be a challenge to assemble it i personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how i am wired i am not good at putting things together without help good product after you get it assembled james there are so many reviews of this little jewel i won t bother going into details but it s everything i could have hoped for and more the sound quality is amazing and it s very easy to use i m using it for so many things including a music player for my truck i take it everywhere and it has never let me down i had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that are included i have no complaints great stand well made safe for ur guitar and practical w safety cord on top worth getting it this is one of the better stands out there cuz its well made and great cushined for ur guitar and with a great price
823	i have a fender t bucket acoustic guitar and i put heavy guage strings on it as beginner these strings were not good for me i tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings good quality glad i bought these i initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding i was wrong they have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal i have a schecter hellraiser with emg x series pickups and they go great with them they are easier to bend too which is great i no longer use heavier strings like i use too these will be my mainstay haven t used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected so far so good i recommend it i paid only and it is small and convenient i was impressed with the sound at first i played it with my line watt amp i didn t like it cause of the squealing but then i read how you use it and all that boy it worked great i use it with a tascam us usb plugin to my computer and i get a good sound for practice i still like my line amp though for more sounds and sustain but this is a bargain and small you can use this with any usb audio interface if you like ac dc you would like this there are different amp sounds you can get cheap and convenient i am not disappointed my opinion is that it sounds best with a usb guitar audio device such as tascams us the us works fine for my needs rough and ready audio tracking with bit cubase on bit windows my pc is for general use with a non studio configuration no mixer non phantom power mics headphone monitoring if you re buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs you ll need a separate mixer and or standalone phantom supply from the mixer you can cable to the us s line input via rca jacks on the back there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i don t blame the device it uses stock o s drivers that loaded right up the documentation is minimal and only covers up to vista but it s accurate and you ll manage with win on the windows side make the usb audiocodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card based audio and speakers i have realtek onboard and desktop speakers i m using asio all with cubase and cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring vst connections and i o busses once configured however it s been solid i d recommend checking out user forums for your particular software platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations on an xp machine changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the daw on win once i unplug the us the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers if i plug the us back in the settings revert again very reliable even better if i want to use cubase strictly for midi the software detects the change and i don t have to reconfigure connections or busses that may be a function of cubase so again it pays to research your particular software while the us is connected you ll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the us s headphone jack or audio out rca jacks this is where the balance control is very helpful it s not a pan it s a center position gain mixing the computer s output from within your daw as well as outside system sounds with direct monitoring of your input signal very simple to use for overdubbing some people may prefer a hard left right pan while overdubbing i can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature if you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done there are a number ways to go unplug the us and restart your daw run a cable from the rca outs on the us to the mini jack aux in on your desktop speakers run a mini jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the us to the aux in while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and vis versa rather than having to pull out the headphone i would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output but i can live without it again the us works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities you can t rely on the product description or packaging to answer that fortunately there s enough user information out there for just about any setup it shouldn t be difficult to track down this is the best usb microphone out for under bucks it s a shame that its been out for a few years now and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one i love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording the sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as i have this fairly close to my computer in my office and i can t hear the computer in my recordings i haven t used this microphone with instruments as i am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video and it sounds great the only thing you have to do it plug it in and go you need no additional drivers to run this microphone in windows i did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone but it worked perfectly after that i just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock mount yeti combo pack as i have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven t used the base that much since arriving at that setup if you are in the market for an excellent usb microphone look no further you can t get anything better than this for under bucks just make sure you get a pop filter for it and yes the blue pop filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn t just check out my review video for the blue pop blue microphones the pop universal pop filter
824	the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position but i stand in front of a mic on stage the pedal generates a lot of noise so i can t use it you get what you pay for king vox and dunlop high gain both passive have passed the test and i m pretty picky i have been using this little amp very heavily for about a year now and highly recommend it the device is extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next to my mixer it does exactly what i expect the sound is clean works great great price meets my requirements perfectly it does the job easy to get on and off seems to be sturdy and well built best of all the price easy accurate and best of all it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing i ve tried other brands and they don t swivel correctly i ve tried so many other strings over the years just to see if i was missing something i wasn t there s something about the feel and tone of ernie ball regular slinkys that i absolutely love my local music store has for the price of deal on strings which is a nice deal however this deal is a little sweeter if you can wait for the delivery it s a no brainer
825	love this kit it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths make your axe shine and look like a rockstar i had an issue with my new squire guitar and fender hooked me up with a set of these the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end rather then the typical small loop the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity i say they sound great and are worth trying i just order packs so i can have some on hand i ve had a jam man for some time which as a tech person i ve found incredibly difficult to figure out perhaps i didn t take the time anyways this pedal on the other hand is a leap forward in the opposite direction i didn t need instructions just punched in layed down a riff and jammed for about hours straight i did this for two days in a row it s simple built well and and fun to use can t recommend it enough it will improve your playing and should be a required tool for guitar players
826	this stand easily folds and holds my mandolin in a scratch proof stance not good for smaller instruments like the name may imply to some an attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed but everything from tenor uke and up did just fine good quality one i like the big size type would like to have a thinner one so far so good no string expert here but these work great they stay in tune like i can t even believe actually thought someone was tuning my guitar it stays in tune so long these were the strings i started on a year ago and have tried a few different brands in this time frame they hold up imo as well or better than most brands i ve tried especially for the price i probably change my strings more than necessary so i have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality these fit that requirement well i ordered this because i have an ovation and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstock due to the small size and adjustable clip this tuner fit perfectly and well out of the way it took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the on off button but no problem now as a tuner i really like it the small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light haven t tried it in bright light yet the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable and it did a great job in a noisy gig where i changed tunings about times during the evening
827	i like them but these strings are probably not for everyone the exp s do provide a crisp bright sound almost leaning towards metallic this tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow bodied ovation however i have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different while i was not expecting it my favorite aspect of the exp s is the playability the play is a little more elastic than i thought it would be and they are amazingly easy on the fingers the only downside that i experienced with the exp s is the fact that while giving once on the guitar they are a little brittle off the guitar i almost snapped my e getting it set up other than that the strings are just a little squeaky i personally like a little squeak but at the current price point i don t think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don t i m quite happy with any of the on stage brand stuff i have like i said this thing is solid well built good quality and they thought of all the little features you need jamb nut at the top little nylon tip on the thumb wheel so you don t scratch up your post just good stuff i use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals i don t use this on my pedal board and don t know if i would recommend it for heavy live use i suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here it does work well and will power many pedals at one time i do not use it for powering only one pedal though this device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals i also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet easy to use it is what it is nice daisy chain if it s bought along with the spot adapter just make sure to avoid using all the connectors since it could overload the adapter and you ll have noise problems and performance issues if you use analog pedals connected as i do there won t be any problem i had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions so what i do is that i have a spot adapter connected to a power strip with my boss pedals and a wah and in the other power strip slot i have another generic adapter connected with my mxr noise clamp so it doesn t interferes with them i works just fine i bought this with my mbrace and it seems to be pretty sturdy i would think it would work even better with a mic maybe they included some sticky pads and i missed it this thing is great in theory but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesn t have a guitar resting in it it does well at its job when it s in use i e it doesn t fall when there s a guitar but i think i ll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it s lying in wait
828	i like d addario strings but these did not impress me they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion this gauge is perfect for my gibson j the phospher bronze alloy wrap brings out hidden tonal snap in this old rather heavily braced guitar the may be too bright for a lighter instrument but they really shine on my old guitar you cannnot go wrong with elixir accoustic guitar strings taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another however you cannot go wrong with those strings i highly recommend them i like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings i have tried great tuner it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar i will buy another one of this it does a fair job but i have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on it seems to pick up sympathetic string notes i actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate
829	made of quality material i do not need anything fancy because i am a simle person it does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar buy this it s cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost times as much it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard amazing sounds i ve been using and abusing pedal effects since the s running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years i said all that b c i don t want to come off as condescending i ve learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative you ll fry a boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except digitech which want plugs make sure the voltage matches a v adaptor into a v pedal won t power it checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the behringer pedals i use about six of them on my board see product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor i fried a bbe delay the same way happy effecting behringer sm slow motion effects pedalbehringer dd guitar delay effect pedalbehringer cs compressor sustainer ultimate dynamics effects pedalbehringer adi v tone acousticbehringer pb preamplifier volume boosterbehringer ph classic phase shifterbehringer us ultra shifter harmonist ultimate pitch shifter harmonist effects pedalbbe two timer dual modedigitech dgr grunge analog distortion pedalelectro harmonix micro q tron envelope follower pedaljim dunlop m mxr m distortion digitech rp guitar multi effects processor so there are some people who review this as superb with no noise and just the best thing ever to be honest i have no idea where this is coming from i do get a good amount of noise static buzz that makes it difficult to use it when playing your guitar in a more quiet mode also the sustain is not as good as i thought it would be and i had to do a lot of fine tuning with my amp to find a satisfying setting works best with some additional reverb setting that said for the price it is pretty good i do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic it is what it is a rather inexpensive compressor that does a pretty good job for that price they work great with my pedals not sure if it s the pedals or the cords but i noticed with my full rig and using all the cords there is a noticeable hum in the background i m sure a noise gate could solve that problem but oh well i can deal with it
830	this cable seems like it will last me for a while as it is only being used to connect a di box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do good product at a good price have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker great to have when friends come over to jam i like to hit things i use drums so nobody else gets hurt i need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not say local wildlife these have the sweetest tone for battery based abuse thanks vic also flammable this shelf is exactly what i needed at a reasonable price i used this on my wall mount u rack to hold my modem and router near my switch as an added bonus it has vent holes on the bottom which not only allow for heat dissipation but also make really convenient ziptie tie down locations i ll definitely be buying more of these i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception microphone there are ins and outs balanced unbalanced on each channel i am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position i run this direct to my digital recorder i get a good clean sound on my vocals still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit the unit is channels has rack mounts and is sturdy not sure on the tube yet new to the behringer product line but so far i like it and will explore its potential stars for price quality features amazon these are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work i m using them in our drum room one is on hi hat and one is on a small cymbal they have a smooth un hyped sound the mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box i have used them in an x y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of each so i am aware of what expensive microphones sound like these perform up there with the expensive mice while being bargain priced good music to all i use this with my small mobile dj setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all this pack rocks they have on off buton the quality feels sturdy and i had it next to shure mics that cost more but sound the same for karaoke vocals i bough two other sets and ft cables tons of useful information on this wheel my only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written seems like reasonably durable construction compact enough to stow it in a guitar case good quality well made its a simple cable what can be said it was a good deal did the job i bought this to use on my fender p bass it is not reliable for me sometimes it works and sometimes it can t find the low note correctly i m still using my roland stomp box tuner glad this was inexpensive it was not worth the hassle to return i gave it away
831	when i was searching for midi cables for my art x foot controller i came across these hosa ones and they were dollars each as they are now i realize i would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly you must realize that they are only feet as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer for any connection from racked sound modules this will be perfect this my second hosa guitar cable the other one is shorter like my first hosa cable this is a high quality item i d definitely buy more cables of this brand have to reorder soon great strings for the money i play guitar with a cou ple of my buddies and they love them too sound quaility is great every midi usb converter on amazon below bucks seemed sketchy but i tried this one with my casio keyboard works on logic and garageband however whenever i try to use modulation or pitch bend it creates a actual note on my mac and won t stop unless you quit the program be wary i have used these and i noticed this capo is a cut above the rest it snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away i do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off i would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts
832	wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh some people pay for silver and expect gold okay so i bought this because i do app review videos for a blog and my blue snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard p hard t hard b s and a few others so i got this here are my pros and cons pros it works i tested in sony vegas pro with and without the filter the pop sound is completely removed with the filter which means it does what it was designed to do stars it does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech d it looks nice attached to my blue snowball it looks like a professional product it doesn t really matter since i work from home and not in a public place but it s nice to know i can show it to people and it looks nice the clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately the clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface so mounting this to say a desk probably won t be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic i don t know why people think this isn t sturdy i mean you re not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing the build quality is quite excellent considering that it s fragile screens attached to plastic and metal cons it s pretty big i used to shorten the stem on my blue snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage i can t do that anymore with this pop filter on it now it s become a permanent member of the front of my desk outside of this thing doubling the space my snowball takes up i have no complaints about this pop filter it works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good this should be the last pop filter i have to buy for a long time i have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use it is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right the padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which i have used it i don t know how it would hold up for touring or constant use but it is perfect for my needs as i am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio all adjustments keep position well about as sturdy as a tripod can be exactly as advertised no complaints from this user practical useful for drum kit tilts to match personal requirement fits easily onto cymbal stand and importantly holds in place during performances prof mike haller
833	long story short this string set has a strong metallic character which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much many people might like it but for me absolutely noooooooo i have a seagull guitar so by its nature it sounds mellow warm and mild with stock strings so when my strings wear out i got this now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my fender archtop s neck position without the power that an emg pickup has to offer yes it is that bad you can t do this to guitars like seagulls bottom line i recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar if you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string i only recently started playing the guitar and as a beginner i wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitar this one came at a great price and it s sturdy enough for me so i think this is very decent strap for the price i paid for it it s quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily based on other reviews i made my purchase this is a great unit it sounds good and loud enough two downsides both are about the noise i live on the th floor as long as i turn the volume up it acts like a radio i mean very loud radio background and i couldn t get ride of it this is the only thing that annoys me but i think it depends on where people live when this is not properly tuned it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise other than the radio part none of these are major issues as a mini amp you can t really expect that much not to mention it s not expensive at all overall i like it and i would recommend it by the way this unit comes with a v battery no strings i ve tried are like this it doesn t have a strong character but work together with your guitar my seagull now sound mellow with brightness also this string is perfect for finger picking i love it i bought this guitar nearly a year ago it was my first guitar i never cared much for the sound it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul yes it s x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat but it sounds x better if you buy a squier i think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar you ll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etc or just buy a better guitar to begin with at this price point you probably won t find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar i ve been in professional broadcast studios that don t have mics as nice as this one good flat response but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you don t like to eq after the fact sounds like a million bucks this is a very well built stand even with its slim design which also comes with a nice carrying case very good for light portable set ups also holds a big mic if you position the legs right completely open with the mic parallel to a leg that said do it wrong and plunk will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only paid for it would give it stars but i know user error will cause a less careful person to crash some mics good for kick drum and cab mics by the way anchor it down with a sand bag if using it for this purpose if you are totally a beginner and have nothing to begin with get this guitar and a vox amplug ac use it with your headphones or home speakers don t upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level prepare for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade if your budget is below that don t bother and save more speak from experience i ve tried a lot and did many research this guitar with amplug just sound amazing plus it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out guitars and amps below yes there are good stuff but you re more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter for a budget around if you don t go professional you will be happy with them forever so do yourself a favor one shot no waste of time and money this guitar is good enough for any beginners most under guitars don t have good pickups so why spend extra money again my bloody experience taught me that i ve spent time and money way more than free advice i strongly recommend this guitar it has no fault towards its price
834	this is not a bad product just not great as soon as i received it i installed it on my custom made grit laskin guitar and played with it for over two hours installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes my problems with it are fold sounds just a bit tinny too much on the high end and not an equal amount of bass a small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries and i couldn t get mine to work in passive mode and the biggest complaint is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you re performing on stage you have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft like i said it is not a bad product just not top notch and definitely not for professionals if you re just fooling around at home or recording at home it is fine and will do the job for you but if you re a pro you ll want to spend double the money and get an l r baggs m the m gives you the truest sound unbelievable works in passive mode and is very easy to change the volume control sincerely doc it does what it is suppose to cut vibration and well i might add much better than a standard clip on a mic this one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off since it s rubber if it does break has a lifetime warranty had a shure sm on a table on a stand in this clip pounded on the table only picked up the tap sound my hand has making and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table moved the mic off axis pounded again absolutely no noise can t ask for more than that i have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a cable these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others and they work great no loss of tone through these cables if anything i had to do some eq adjusting because after using these i had a far greater signal volume and frequency response when i replaced my other patch cables with these i love them as soon as i attached my mic and with my strong hands i over twisted the mic holder on the threads and the thread piece came loose on the stand i think i can fix it with some liquid metal but this is not as impressive as some mic stands i ve had in the past sincerely docafter a few months of trying to make it work it doesn t i changed my rating from to this puppy is just poor quality excellent pedal i love this chorus it is perfect to me the effect is really great mxr has a very good quality
835	totally perfect for holding my guitar super sturdy easy to put in take out wide enough stance that you don t have to worry about it falling over on carpet this piece of plastic is just terrible you d be better off with a couple of books and a towel not recommended high end pick felt comfortable even with its larger size took awhile to get used to but really liked it i only use elixirs on my taylor now because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing and because they are super smooth it s like playing a silk guitar get these strings i really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar the rubber makes it easy to hold onto and i feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well
836	does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come was not too expensive for such good quality great sounding slider for my electric and it won t shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action it has a great sound for the modern electric guitars but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances i recommend i have a line vetta ii with a floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects for gigs and in my studio including a wah pedal but sometimes i take my smaller marshall down below to jam with friends i just needed something low priced that would do the job for me in that situation and i ended up with something a lot more when i bought this pedal i got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now i really like it and for the price i don t see how you can beat it it seems well made and i think or i hope it will hold up well with normal care i ve only ever used my line floorboard and before that an old crybaby for wah effects before but i ll tell you what i really like about this pedal it s spring loaded so it comes back up by itself it says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah i don t even have to think about whether it s on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways i never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage i also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs the only reason i didn t give it five stars is because there s some sort of semi annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes it only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up so i can avoid it if i try i don t know if it s just mine or is something inherent in this pedal i ll update this review if i ever figure it out i bought this for occasional use with a guitar mostly it collected dust but sometimes i play guitar in a band where i mix from the stage and the vocalist likes a little slappy echo on his voice but between songs he likes the delay off so i figured an experiment was in order i ran cables one from the aux out on my board to the delay input the other from the delay output to an open channel on my board i turned the level to max and dialed the really wet signal into the monitors and foh i let him kick that pedal on and off all night now i can concentrate on playing and not on whether i forgot to mute unmute his stupid delay win and it sounds pretty darned good i shaved a little treble off the channel so it didn t get too in the way almost like an analog quality good stuff i had to tune my guitar and i bought this well it works great i got the sound i wanted
837	i love these strings i ve tried others but i always come back to these great for beginners the phosphor bronze provide a lower deeper tone that i prefer but still very bright i wanted a string but did not want to spend a lot of money this guitar fits the bill the finish is much darker then the pictures online show great sound from this bad boy this is a big guitar once i figured out how to tune the string it really does not go out of tune after i few hours of play i retune it and its marginally out of tune i thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality while they are not grover tuners they get it done the downside for me is not the guitar s fault this is an inexpensive guitar and a fantastic entry into string playing this guitar is hard to play below the th fret as there is no cut away but that is true of all guitars using this body type now that i have had it awhile i would love for it to be acoustic electric but again for the price i was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action im keeping it have these on my tele very interesting to play around with i bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so i bought these instead these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys they still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone when playing these i tend to play more sixties inspired the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool i really like them but they are completely different and i wouldn t recommend them to everyone as far as cq goes these are great no problems feel great sound great this is really a great amp for the price if you re new to electric guitar and you want an amp to get started buy this one it has incredible versatility and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different amps i got much more than i expected for the price of this amp i really like the bassman and twin reverb settings i won t claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger better vintage tube etc but this will more than meet your needs to use at home buy the w version which is plenty loud for home later when you have the skills to justify it start buying some tube equipment this amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play i considered various new used amps in the same price range and i m extremely happy i picked this one if you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me i d tell you to go away but if you stop by with a nice twin reverb i d give up my mustang but then i d go buy another one i love this thing and for the price you just can t beat it it seems sturdy and i have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up i haven t tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my electric guitars very nicely set up only took about min or so and it included all the tools necessary i saw the same one in guitar center a week later for more like i said for the price you can t beat it
838	yes these strings are amazing i discovered these on my new taylor and now i ve put them on all my gits they really are the better string i was a fan of ernie ball on my electrifieds and d addario on my acoustics but no more i m only using these they are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics they bend easy so they are nice on the electrics they do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings but it s worth it a great clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps the guides on these are not rollers but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon the only guides that i like better are the round s guides for tele s but then i like those asthetically only on tele s an inexpensive mode that looks and works great to the inexperienced eye this simple clean looking mod can make a mexican or chinese instrument look more like the made in america models the tuners arrived today i had them shipped to my business address it took me longer to get home from work than it took me to remove the stock tuners replace them with these perfect fit they look great i put this on my fender jazz bass after i bought a new neck for it this plate work the exact same as the stock plate but it dresses the bass up a bit this is not a mod that people will see like pickup covers but i like the way it looks when i pick it up to play they seem the same but the original schallers that came with my tele deluxe are bigger and stronger for the lack of a better word still a good buy look no further this is the best booster with an internal eq what else can you ask for go for it if you need a versatile small booster it comes with a v battery
839	purchased after another folding stand which cost the same literally fell apart this one is much better although not quite as portable on the plus side music stays put on this one it s very stable and the height is fully adjustable you can buy with confidence hard to believe this was so bad i have a planet waves locking guitar strap which is a dream and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap however it is so thick that it can t really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap and when i tried to lock it the two pieces came apart go with the planet waves lock straps i got what i ordered however if i had paid more attention this is nothing but a standard power supply which i could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the tascam name on it update after receiving comments and reading other reviews i ve gotten a comment and have read many comments and i don t know where the fault lies but this power supply is not the power supply for the new replacement tascam dr mkii the power supply for that unit is the ps p uif you are unsure what power supply for which model tascam recorder you have go to tascam s website and research it before buying it the tascam psp ac adapter power supply for mpgt is for and does work with the older tascam dr recorder i have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered pa head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent only complaint is that the cameo is not as well done as shown in the picture other than that the strap is of good quality very pleased with this item it really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole
840	i ve been playing guitar and using capos for years i ve learned this if you are a serious guitar player there are many must have items you need in your arsenal one of them is a capo by clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device they are quite common inexpensive and the basic design really hasn t changed in many years until now that s where this product comes in this capo is great because it doesn t simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob the reason this matters is because depending on the guitar sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension or not enough when clamped too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes either one is not good this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner i highly recommend compared to the nickel wound xl light gauges i buy in the set boxes the balanced tension xl set amounts to slightly lighter d and a strings and respectively which i can feel as well as a slightly thicker b string which frankly i can t feel the xls are comparable in gauge to ernie ball regular slinky yellow but if you re used to slinky s as i was for many years the nickel wounds feel noticeably coarser to the skin and took awhile to get used to i love them now for blues rock or funk any kind of playing where you want to dig in a bit for tone although i will say that for slide especially when recording at relatively low volume they don t give quite the same glassy sounding undertone to my ears as steel wounds something i happen to prefer i put the xls on an squire strat which i like to bend strings on and the position switch gives me a nice range of color to compare like the regular xls i noticed very little new string zing after giving them a good stretch when my skin is dry indoors during the winter the nickels can feel rough at first but in warmer humid temps i sweat more and they get as slick as any steel wounds i think the balanced tension is more a factor when playing chords than single lines and for me it s more of feel thing rather than something i hear that doesn t make it any less significant to me i ve tossed brand new sets of strings and sold perfectly good guitars on the vague basis they didn t quite feel right to tell the truth when playing out i prefer an even heavier set than regular lights for tone but at home when recording or just playing for myself i like the amount of resistance i get from the nickel wound xls versus the slinky s i used since i began playing as a kid you have to work a little harder with the nickels for bends and intonation but i like the tone and feel overall and i think it s made me a more precise player great strings with a good feel to them they are size which is just right for my electric guitars i won t know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey if they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and i will switch if they last a long time i don t think of these as extra lights they are more of a light to me i can t speak on the claim for a longer string life the strings are true to elixir s quality and tone these strings sound great plug and unplugged i also had the opportunity from vine to try the phosphor bronze too there are tonal differences as expected the are brighter but the tones are clear and crisp when amplified i did note less finger noise as i re positioned or slid my fingers along the strings i didn t notice any difference to the feel of the string as compared to other nanoweb elixir strings that i have used over the years time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions for now even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb you re still getting a good deal i ordered this for my husband the musician he said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel he would definitely purchase this product again
841	quiet and durable i ve been using hosa cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced i particularly like the right angle plug it works well on most guitars except strats and strat style guitars that s still not a problem because i simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar this cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables i m very pleased with it and recommend it i like the quality of the picks not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style thanks when just starting out one purchases equipment carefully this capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there even a professional would appreciate this capo a three star at best i was not impressed with the finish or feel and i use a capo often you can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product
842	i have purchased six of these over the last couple years why because they work they mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place i don t think i d ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall they feel rock solid too i highly recommend and will be buying more in the future i gave it stars because i haven t used any other devices like these before maybe there is something better but i haven t seen it yet slick i bought this to work with my year old son this will do many cool things although i am not ready to turn him loose with it yet i have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software i have been using audacity which is a free download i would pay the price again in a hartbeat haven t got to far into this thing yet but i do like it same classic behringer plastic housing that i personally never had problems with definitely get some odd tone change to work with here i d say check your youtube channel to hear for yourself if not familiar with the tones i was able to connect it to my pc there was a horrible delay between the keyboard and the pc but once i installed better midi software coolsoft virtualmidisynth and turned down the delay it s nearly realtime i had problems getting it to work on my imac it recognized the device s presence but it didn t produce any sound on the computer i think this is my fifth behringer pedal admittedly i haven t had the time to try this one out but based on my others i d say this will do everything the pedals that cost double or more can do
843	its a nice pice easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar the only matter and its not a big deal is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect this is fine as a general stick on inexpensive pick holder it doesn t hold very many picks but it really doesn t have to i would give this five stars except that i really prefer the planet waves led key chain pick holder over this it costs more but has more functional value to me if all you need is something very simple and you have a surface you can stick it on then this is fine received promptly and tested out with acoustic electric guitar the sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances the treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine the small amp is just what i was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus i haven t tried it yet since i can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a inch rca plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time
844	this original plug fits the purpose perfectly quality and precision the plugs don t take up space couldn t be smaller and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with make sure what you receive is a one spot product in its original packaging check images there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today sure some are said to be the best at this or that but for me the rat is the one that does it all and at a great price to boot this pedal is not new to me i ve had a few of them in the past but the rat is just a great as the older vintage models goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer to a near fuzztone with some warm smooth creamy tones in between remarkable no other distortion pedal can do it as well i ve been playing for decades and have had more than my share of them but the rat delivers no joke it just does it all and well the filter tone is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise that might thow a few folks off but it s a little thing really the filter is the core of it s tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion by going higher with the distortion control the volume only goes up a little that s great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit the volume won t go through the roof silent switching no hum no buzz and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit flawless comes to mind here easy to set up strong as a tiger tank and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of or knobs for you to mess with and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past kinda cool if you ask me if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues get yourself a rat if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a boo teek pedal that sits in the rat s shadow buy that high dollar unit and you can at least look good while you play but your tone will still stink its up to you me its a no brainer i go with the rat bought this as a supplement to my other amps to record blues tones i first saw it in a big box musician s store while there was a blues guitar session going which is a public jam session open to anyone they had a lot of tube fender amps plugged in i was surprised when i plugged into this amp away from that group turned it up and started playing it sounded just as good as those other amps the two employees that worked there and two other customers couldn t believe where the sound was coming from even the other players checked it out i don t understand how fender has managed to keep this amp a secret for so long poor marketing maybe i don t know but if you want a blues or blues rock amp with some great vintage tones check these out pick up a used one they sound like a tube amp because essentially they are the amp sounds big and warm from the tubes not thin and tin like has great overdriven tweed blackface and bassman models a couple of the marshall settings aren t bad either this amp sounds better than the super champ to my ears tried this out at the store as well which makes sense since it s a class a amp as opposed to class b warmer and more articulate the speaker is decent but this amp also sounds great using an external speaker cabinet for home jamming and recording blues without driving everyone nuts this amp is a god send check one out and you ll want it i sure wish i could afford a fender twin reverb with the old spring reverb but i don t have the funds and i don t have the back to lug one of those around anymore so my baby boom does the trick it s close enough for my needs i bought this as a second tuner for gigs it is awesome easy to use easy to see simple inexpensive get one you will not be disappointed not every tune needs tremolo i grant you but when you need one this will do the job and them some simple controls the led pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit s settings at all times silent switching in a fx loop there s not a trace of hiss hum or noise in any form in a chain running into an amp s input there is a slight volume increase not much but a little no big deal really unless you re a real tone freak there is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use being a true bypass it changes nothing when off either the box is ultra solid the jacks are all metal the switch is stout in short this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean warm tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit it it anchored to my board it is not going to come off because it s that good besides how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it people say its an ocd clone it sounds very similar i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges but its a very subtle thing all in all i m happy with it knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones good pedal to add
845	this mic works better for some people than others that being said it is the first mic i put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them if it doesn t sound good then i try something else i have no complaints it is my go to mic received it in time standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after days since i was out of days return time sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today i do not have much to say about this it does what it was designed to do and it looks fine i found myself actually trying to see if it will rip for the purposes of this review just so i could make some sort of comment about it you can rip it if you try but it s not likely to happen during everyday use it s fairly thick if that isn t what you want then i would look elsewhere this should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn t have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen i can t believe i m giving a star review to a behringer product but they got these right i replaced a way more expensive audix condenser mic with these and they actually sound pretty darned good if i crunch one or if one breaks i ll just get more at this price i have other behringer mics laying around and they all kinda suck these are totally fine the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside the packing way below average as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing however the great seller i am referring to amazon immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit second unit too had the similar packing but no damages worked fine so i went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest using for audio acquisition for film video purpose pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable considering it s made in china we ll see how they hold up over time so far clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a zoom h recorder my only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture and will not go on all the way on the female side probably one few out of many let s hope it s those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china overall though a great value for a quality cable
846	fantastic just love this little amp at first thought it was broken but batteries were not sitting in right very happy it s ok fits very well on my les paul wall hangers are good space saving ideas but i m one of those who thinks they can stress necks depending on the body neck weight distribution and balance i made my own hanging bases just a carved slab of wood really to support the instrument from the bottom the top hanger now just serves as a rest but depending on the guitar s balance i d recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there s any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward other reviews give an adequate overview of the kit and its potential so i ll just mention particular details the kick pedal spring tension was set too tight making the pedal hard to control and very frustrating to a beginner fortunately the thumbscrew and nut adjustment is easy and made a tremendous improvement in feel and control the documentation is poor and inexcusably there s nothing better available online from alesis the steps in the graphical setup page are less than ideal for a single person assembly the kit allows for tremendous flexibility in positioning the pads horizontally and vertically yet you re pretty much left on your own to discover this experienced drummers will know what they want but i would have appreciated a suggested basic setup showing common variations the control module s buttons and operation are described but there s no detailed guide to the preset kits or selectable pad patches you ll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes there seems to be an ongoing controversy over a firmware update to the controller module whether it fixes an issue with the snare drum pad responsiveness when struck simultaneously with the hi hat or is in fact the cause of an issue with the pad i ve noticed no such problem and as of this date alesis has no such update on their site which leads me to suspect their former patch may have been bad and or they ve updated units currently being sold speaking of the snare the second outer zone for rimshots is nice but i can only get it to trigger while sticking from the outside the technique of laying the stick flat across the head and lifting one end doesn t seem to trigger the rimshot or perhaps i just haven t worked out the touch yet i m interested in a natural sound probably close to a classic jazz kit and a couple of the presets work for me i also have battery and using the kit to trigger those samples opens up vast possibilities still most of the time i just want to sit down and play and don t want to bother firing up the pc and loading software so it s nice to have two workable options the headphone volume could be louder but running it into powered speakers and taking a headphone out from them solves that issue keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lint free cloths dampen one with a little warm water wring it out well and use a light circular motion to remove dust and dirt then wipe gently with the dry cloth to take up any residue this is my first experience with an electronic kit and as others have mentioned the sensation really is fundamentally different from an acoustic instrument particularly when striking the cymbal pads it takes awhile to mentally balance the soft thud or click depending on which surface you strike from outside the headphones with the sampled drum sound within i wasn t sure i liked it for the first couple of weeks meaning i probably didn t but i ve gotten used to it and have gradually begun to relate to the dm on its own terms not as an imitation of an acoustic drum kit but as something else with its own special characteristics for those that want to record i use adobe audition this item is good for recording i use to use my sound card this provides a smoother sound and i don t have to worry about hissing when i record you can just plug in your guitar or bass here is a letter i wrote to tascam on humble advice i would forward this email to all of your subsidiaries any retail store that sells tascam usb audio devices anywhere in the world just today i got the new tascam us usb audio interface it of course uses the windows audio drivers a nightmare occured when i plugged in the device windows xp had the usual detect usb device come up but to my horror it wound up saying a hardware problem occured your hardware may not operate properly something of that sort i spent over hours trying to figure this whole thing out and i read the manual it came with tried all sorts of things oh brother it still would not install by the way this happened with a previous usb audio device not made by tascam that did the excact same thing on my computer but to my luck i found out what the problem was thank god for the website that had this on a blog in the c windows inf folder there must exist two files wdma usb infwdma usb pnfit is really the inf file that is important some software seems to knock these out by renaming them to wdma usbinf bakwdma usbpnf baki simply found the files opened them and renamed them to the proper names and lo and behold when i restarted my computer the tascan us worked its easy to rename the files you just open wdma usbinf bakwdma usbpnf bak and then save them as wdma usb infwdma usb pnf its that simple anyone who works customer service for tascam should know this like i said it happend with a previous usb audio device that i had and i woulnd up selling it at ebay cause i was so frustrated i m happy with the tascam us i hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer and it did the same with a usb phone i have a fully weighted key alesis qs and an m audio axiom semi weighted and they re both fine when i m just playing standalone or recording audio or midi but i wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing per se the alesis is perfect i can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard correctly if that makes sense it makes a clear difference to me i opted for the key strictly for space considerations and while the down up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use i often wish i d gone for a larger model to get wider voicings i may trade it in for an upgrade at some point but overall i m very happy with the keyboard i bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and i m satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second too many instruments for my own good still it could use some tweaks i d recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight especially on carpet where there s even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress it also protects against over tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars i can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldn t take much to tilt over forwards but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies especially electrics counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support making a forward fall unlikely still for sanity s sake i d position the stand close to a wall at first this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand but it s easy to rig up one or two inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort the design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it s not hard i fit an acoustic bass guitar a shaped ibanez artist strat sg shaped bass j bass a martin om a long neck bouzouki six string banjo and a nick lucas shaped recording king acoustic on it that said i don t max out the seven slots i ll use at most simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they re that close if i were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes i might be comfortable with six or even seven i wouldn t use this stand on stage and by on stage i mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it including a house party basement jam session etc it s simply not sturdy enough physics or no but for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it s tight to begin with this pick is well designed for mandolin playing unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners it s also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing the ns mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi octave range of electric bass guitar and mandolin the accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button the tuner s view window is slightly larger than a chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly lit spaces one thing that s less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself if you ve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean i d wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing a lighter color may work better the notes appear red when out of tune their color changes to green as a rough marker you then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note they ve gone to lengths to make the tuner stage friendly but i d much prefer the green color mean fine tuned and done that way i can look from a distance i should only have to bother with the bars if i m struggling to home in and in my experience that s the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by new strings slack under the bridge pins a slipping tuner etc mid life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably so long as you don t use a lot of altered tunings the ns is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back i m a lefty and unlike some other tuners i appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right side up the viewer doesn t extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my l with large new yorker style tuners on headstocks with more bare wood like a strat or even my a style mandolin it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn t obstruct my hand while turning keys at first i didn t like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock i could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like i needed two to remove it one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out after a little practice however i found this wasn t the case and the touch required isn t difficult at all the tuner s constructed in a high impact composite similar to those parachute style clamps you see on backpacks it feels durable and very unlikely to break although i didn t try stomping on it i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag the battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin the tuner has an auto shutoff function to preserve battery life the power and frequency buttons are just nibs really i d prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them the tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from to if doesn t work for you one advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren t limited to usually diatonic open strings for myself i only use tuners to set the pitch of one string usually the low a for guitar or bass and low g for mandolin in my opinion tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics and neither does the job well intonation is subject to a bunch of variables string action and thickness neck relief fret condition nut and bridge condition once i have a single string to pitch i match fretted and open string unisons and octaves after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument i used to love staring at those pignose sized strob a tuners sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately i wish many more did i m not quite sure how we went from we tune because we care to i m so embarrassed to be standing here tuning i hope no one notices but the ns mini headstock tuner questionable design choices and all does what it says with a minimum of fuss i ve been using slinky regular nickels for over years on my electrics and love them i ve tried various coated strings etc but always come back to ernie for sound and value but on my acoustics it s been d addario j s since day one and still is never had one bad set out of over a hundred i adore the sound and the reliability so why have i never tried their e git strings because the slinkys are perfect but i must say so are these i just put a set of s on one of my strats and they are as snappy yet not too bright as i could want they really complement the single coil tones especially the and out of phase positions so if you re a strat fan and love that tone give these a shot one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact no idea why but if you have huge posts and like mega wraps here s your puppy i only do a triple wrap max so it s just more to cut but hardly an issue and no matter what the coated string fans say those might stay clean longer but that brand new string zing only lasts a few hours on any string coated or not so if you re recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones or playing big gigs where tone is everything i say stick with uncoated strings and aside from slinkys these are the best i ve played the dp ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp digital portastudio i have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the dp ex on its own terms pointing out features and issues important to me mostly workflow related as someone who grew up home recording with analog equipment if you want all the details of the full functionality i d recommend downloading the manual from tascam or a dealer site that offers it speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first there are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy or better yet downloading a second copy is a good idea this is picky but i found the larger size of the dp manual easier to read and handle than the smaller dp ex i ve used software based daws for years and while i enjoy midi recording mixing and editing with them basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when i used analog equipment i have a one room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and aside from pc noise i miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old mk ii cassette track instant power on press record pause ready set go granted i don t miss the wall of hiss that plagued those recordings but i had fun capturing a lot of musical moments using a hardware control surface with my daw didn t solve the problem i just find the reality of booting windows dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment especially when recording acoustic instruments i hoped the dp ex would provide some of that older experience with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup the bottom line for me is it does and it doesn t first some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions size wise the difference between porta and pocket studios is roughly x x inches versus x x inches tascam doesn t provide a case or cover for the dp ex but a larger ereader or tablet case should do fine and i d recommend one if you plan on portable use the plastic appears fairly durable but it s still plastic the knobs on the dp ex are smaller in diameter lower and have rounded tops compared to those on the dp however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip i also find the smaller circular pushbuttons on the dp ex don t protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar shaped buttons on the dp and are less comfortable to use the data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the dp ex which i prefer the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus you ll need the dedicated ps p v power supply for the dp ex the v ps l for the dp can t be shared the plug won t fit so you can t fry it and don t even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously on the other hand the teac rc f footswitch is sharable you ll need a mini plug to phone adaptor but i think it s indispensable if you re working alone speaking of power a strong plus for both recorders and for me a deal breaker were it not present is phantom mic power so you re not limited to the built in stereo condensers they re not bad for rough work but unlike mic stand mounted portables it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals i can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar acoustic or electric amp violin or percussion i want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics i like the resistance of the faders on the dp but i can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the dp ex there s no cd burner either on the smaller unit but with usb transfer capability that s not an issue for me having similar xlr phono and rca jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste i m not bothered by it because i have space to run the cables but it s worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you the led screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues the flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be especially since the menu is used so much a slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble i do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at degrees and doesn t interfere with jack access it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use tascam should consider a similar accessory the software is largely the same for both units aside from additional mastering tools essentially packaged presets and here lies my major criticism i feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality i e levels eq arming tracks with dedicated knobs and buttons and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what i see is an inflexible constraining menu system if there were some way to customize the menu navigation the equivalent of software hot keys it s possible the frequent repetition of non functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do the best evidence of an unbalanced design i see is the dedicated phantom power button on both units whose purpose is to display the phantom screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off that crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder when space for knobs and buttons is severely limited i can understand the design thinking and trade offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu but the dp ex is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi tracker a fostex x effectively doubled up the functionality of two tracks to cover four so i have to question whether the trade offs tascam made here in fact diminish the user experience with connectivity and software based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving i believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the dp ex will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience i think tascam would be well served taking that into account i ve always liked the design of tascam gear it just looks and feels well made and that s still in large part true of the dp ex but i can t help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old mk ii cassette track would satisfy a lot of people out there and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off to describe my impressions of the th s versus my well used sennheiser hd s i chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values i like to use recordings i know well so i can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity andres segovia variations on a spanish folk tune narvaez from my favorite spanish encores in my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar i ve ever heard both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound the distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that segovia s arrangement of the original vihuela texture really emphasize for me there s a difference between bass presence and bass clarity i ll gladly trade less oomph in the gut for the kind of definition the tascam s bring out warm well defined with a crisp and clear treble edge the sennheisers while equally balanced were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top they were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board the th s just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings jeff beck you know what i mean from blow by blow the george martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made the clean separation and space in the mix between guitar electric piano clavinet bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system the th s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the sennheisers and overall more presence it s a bit recording and this is the first time i can honestly say i hear the difference like being there in the control room seriously there s a greyness to the sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before but after hearing the tascam phones i doubt i ll ever be satisfied with less again stravinsky violin concerto anne sophie mutter from mutter modern the words i keep coming back to are presence and clarity i can hear string attacks counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the th s that i simply don t hear with the sennheiser phones as far as craftsmanship the th s weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups the sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually the cup mounts are really well designed and allow fine grained way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears i like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head the cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort the cord is a hybrid the closest to the phones is flat diameter well insulated matte finish and flexible beyond that there s another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another feet i think it s a nice compromise that s probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to as we get older our hearing changes for most people it s a decrease in high frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum simply listening louder isn t always the best solution and it can be a tremendous ear opening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones i d encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these tascam th s are a good place to start i am a fan of planet waves ns capos but this new one is not very well designed the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards i find my left hand hitting the lever when i m in open position frustrating it does have a pick holder which can be handy and a place to put an ns tuner which can also be handy i just think it could have been better designed i don t particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff i ll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser i put the set on my squire jazz bass with threaded bridge rollers if you don t like loading up the tuners trim a few inches off the leads they re about inches and have no cloth covering like fenders i usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the flexsteels have overall less tension i let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing yeah ironic for a set designed for slapping gave them a good stretch and they re holding pitch well i find the windings on the flexsteels more comfortable than rotosounds at least comparing new to new that helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting overall i m more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there s plenty of piano low end sproing squire lake and ray bennett fans will feel right at home fingers or pick the set is so bright sounding in fact i had to roll a considerable amount off the label says light top medium bottom i found the gauge balance between the low e a and the high d g a little more pronounced than i d like but not outright uncomfortable
847	i ve been using a crybaby for going on years now some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way well i ve never noticed to me these always feel perfect also you can adjust which part of the sweep you re using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the pot i ve tried other wahs morley doesn t do it for me and the vox is very good i just have always gone with what i knew no complaints with the crybaby not much to say here strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player you need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style these are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years i replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping times a year the strings are great priced great and was on sale which made it even better there is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that s good too thank u behringer your pedals really kick ass this one is outstanding and for the price can not get a better deal highly recommended love these guitar stands sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price you will pay up to x more for similar stands great bargain just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned the thumbpicks both came in medium which at the time i didn t pay any attention to however after about weeks of using them and the fingerpicks on my banjo i came to the conclusion that i needed a large size for my thumb the mediums sat a little too high up my thumbnail for comfort i suppose you could put them in hot water to stretch them out as i have read but regardless for a quick n dirty set for someone just starting out its just the ticket without having to buy a bunch of sets of to figure out what is comfortable with price assortment in mind i give stars open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now
848	these cables work well in my jam space they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in gig ing but at the price that s fair don t get me wrong these are good cables and for the price i am very happy i d buy more for sure i would probalby uses these for gigging as well if i didn t have heavier duty jumpers available as the title says these are a great value and work well i was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot or the floor the strap wouldn t hold my guitar any longer i wanted something cheap something that don t require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it i was worried about damaging my guitar so i decided to get this strap lock it rocks and it works perfectly works like a champ i only have four pedals on it thus far but i haven te had any problems no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldn t handle the load i still have open leads for those other pedals smile my power strip now has more space for other toys to make my weak playing sound better if you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar after purchasing many kinds of attachments to amplify my mandolin or fiddle with little or no satisfaction i ordered this little mic i didnt expect much considering the price it works so great i ordered a few more clip it into the guitar sound hole or on the head stock or on the mandolin head stock or on the fiddle each time it delivers a natural pleasant sound not distorted or squeaky the cord is long enough for me to stand and move around some while i play that is a great bonus for me
849	this review is legit i bought this mixer back in august or september cant really remember but i had a horrible experience with this unit but that s my fault i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything so i didnt know how to use it i hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input and got a horrible terrible mix the hiss from the fan ruined it i nearly had a panic attack so i took like months to do research and found out that behringer made the uca uca for this unit and the mixer to remove the hiss and unwanted noise so buy this with the uca uca to clear up your recordings do not buy a rca to mm cable if your using this for a studio setting like me and if your beginning like me do not let these wealthy people fool you you dont need thousand dollar equiptment the podcaststudio usb from behringer would be fine so all in all with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer the quality was good but the hiss ruined it use a usb audio interface with this from behringer do it if you want star audio quality their website has asio drivers to assist you ohhh and go on youtube and search up uca studio you ll get videos to help please please please please do research before you buy anything good day everyone d quite a few people are complaining about the buzz caused induced by this i m not getting any i use an old arion stage tuner a digitech bad monkey and cm tube overdrive a dunlap wah from the s and a boss ns noise suppressor i run it all into a fender deville which additionally runs into an acoustic b neo bass cab for extra mmmph at first i thought it was the noise suppressor but even when it s off i m getting absolutely no buzz from my effects for the price this is amazing to be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend the cables are very long maybe too long if that s possible if you re even thinking about buying this just buy it already i like the tuner and i m definitely keeping it but the polyphonic aspect of it is pretty useless when you tune using the needle or led version of a needle it will show each string as being in tune then when you strum and use the polyphonic mode it often shows some strings are out and that s even when i use the neck pick up and strum with my thumb as the manual says to do but the tuner works great in the single string mode and i also like the drop d setting and the easy way to switch between the modes it also has very cool and easy ways to adjust the hz pitch and it is very easy to switch to eb tunings and other settings i also like the led lights and the automatic brightness setting that is a very cool feature for those folks who still use batteries to power their pedals the tuner works great and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting so buy it but do it because the price is right and it works great as a tuner in the traditional sense not because of the polyphonic gimmick august edit as follows i just found out a feature of this pedal that i definitely do not like i dislike it so much i had to edit my review i wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in e flat so i set the tuner to the e flat setting as explained in the manual then i tried to tune all the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning it seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning i wrote the manufacturer they did get back to me quickly and they explained that the drop tuning functions only work in polytune mode so if you re like me and you find that polytune doesn t work very well then basically all this is is a standard needle chromatic tuner that will not tune in any other drop modes lame could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box plugged it into the macbook pro fired up garageband and right away it s midi connectivity was intermittent then it had some stuck notes then it stopped being recognized at all it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound the jack was visibly wiggly too so you re mileage may vary but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back rather than bust it open and get soldering iron i returned it and bought an m audio oxygen for more
850	this is my first guitar belt it is not a good fit the connection to the guitar is far too thick i try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage other than that it is usable sort of but i am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar used on open tunings and bass as well as my mandilin i have used the manhasset orchestra light and this is definitely an improvement it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page unlike the manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven it illuminates my entire largemanhasset m regal conductor s music standquite well by itself having said that for a bucks light it feels rather flimsy to me in both construction and light brightness it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights all of which are usually much cheaper the issue being mainly the light switch the jury is out about the clamp though it seems strong of course as an orchestra light it couldn t be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose i am just pointing out that i feel it isn t worth dollars when you consider the whole field of similar lights those not intended for orchestra i bought this because of reputation and reviews but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor therechargeable music stand led light clip on leds with adapter that one has the same negative issues as this light but at a much more acceptable plus free shipping one more thing you should ignore the frequently bought together suggestion to get themighty bright bright light cradlefor this light i bought it and can confirm they are totally incompatible and anyways this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping if desired i am mostly happy with this amp it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs with that said when i was shopping around for an amp both online and in person all the amps i tried and read about both very expensive and very cheap amps had one characteristic in common which is missing from this one and which i thought was universal it doesn t allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing i had to purchase a headphone amp separately wasn t expecting that this may seem a nit pick but considering the universality of this feature you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp other than that this is a great amp i could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it
851	wow these cables are made really sturdy and the noiseless feature is priceless definitely a real good value for the money this is purely an overdrive pedal not a distortion pedal it increases the gain and dirties your tone but it does not actually distort your sound if you re a metal or hard rock player don t buy this it s better suited for country soul r b blues or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when they re doing a solo for that it s excellent especially considering its very low price and despite its very low price it s very solidly built it s like a brick this update is to point out that i ve only used the bad monkey pedal with tube amps a fender blues deville x and a line spider valve hd mk ii running into an ampeg x i have no idea how it ll sound with a solid state amp but it sounds great with a tube amp this update is to point out that i finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good i recently bought a watt fender mustang iii combo to use as a practice amp it perfectly compliments my fender blues deville fender mustang floorboard combination as i ve said i use the bad monkey as a boost for soloing whether i m playing clean or dirty the bad monkey gives my guitar a rich deep great sounding boost this update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is i rarely play directly through any of my amps e g fender hot rod deluxe blues deville super champ x or ampeg b i ll turn down the gain on the bad monkey and use it for a much fatter clean sound it s just so thick like texas chili with lots of umph you ve got to get this pedal this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly one spots come with an pedal multi plug if you only have pedals or lets say you have powering them with an plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly the left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren t plugged into pedals using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff great price great purchase these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex we ve tried d addario brighter sound d addario acoustic guitar strings set exp lite and martin a little stiff martin strings sp phosphor bronze msp in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar the difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nano s have a very light coating that you almost don t feel so if you like standard not coated strings the nano s are probably the way to go if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar for the combination we have these are outstanding strings on the strings lasting longer that s hard to say fresh strings do sound better it s clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non coated strings but i m not certain these last so much longer we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability corrosion or crud on the string isn t the sole factor in changing strings elixir is a wonderful company on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesn t perform up to your standard the other amazing thing i ve watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and i m still very confused the elixir website it s pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes it is so simple and so reproducible i love this technique
852	while i don t have a ton of experience with pedals i really love this one keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain although this is a tube overdrive i actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp it is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what i was looking for a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity for the price i don t see how you can beat this pedal i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome no complaints with this outfit virtually eliminates all outside sound allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions nice flat response if you re into playing blues these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage they allow you to bend the strigs easier i m not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment but i d use these anywhere i installed this in a super champ x as others have pointed out you ll have to turn the treble down after installing it that s because it s designed for making solos stand out i e for adding punch if you re a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing however if you mostly play rhythm i d stick with the stock speaker i want to put two of these into my x blues deville to increase its range and make solos sing while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom there isn t much i can add to the good reviews already out there that i read before purchasing these for my american tele but i will say i really like these tuners and i m very happy i switched to them high quality and great design the guitar just stays in tune now period attractive too with the fender f on the face of the locking knobs and not a big bulky look like i thought they may be before i tried them very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar if your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you ll like them or if you should go with a different brand go with it and get a set of these if your experience is like mine you ll be very satisfied this is now powering my entire effects board and it s doing a great job it easily connects to a variety of different pedals with the adapters included and there s just enough wire to power everything without cluttering anything up with nests of extra wires the value is excellent for anyone on a budget or who is tired of full power strips cluttering up their setup i d recommend this to any musician who uses multiple effects instrument devices i m very satisfied with the performance of the cm with a few tweaking i could emulate the sound i get from my fulltone ocd i d say it s very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the tone control a toggle switch lets you choose between classic modified setting a tweaker s delight the level knob has a lot of juice if you set it at or o clock it s plenty loud enough although you can t use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the gain knob to zero if you have a single coil it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up not so for humbuckers too much gain you can also stack the cm with other pedals i dusted my old boss ds and run it along with the cm and was able to get some good tones the ds usually hurts my ears but with the cm behind it sweet the hardwire cm may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from klon zvex or lovepedal but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost it s well built will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to there may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good try it you can t go wrong update did a full comparison between the cm fulltone ocd joyo crunch distortion gain joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the cm and ocd rd mix the cm has the most amount of control with separate high low controls followed by the ocd with just a tone control and the joyo crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control since the cm has the widest tone range i can make it behave like a treble booster nuance the ocd cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic the cm is a close second and the joyo crunch being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind works great with my fender super champ x amplifier however it does not come with a cable i would highly recommend this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing that s why it s so inexpensive what you see in the picture is what you get but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge it was incredibly easy to install and the sustain is improved one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge the springs in the back keep it back the string tension keeps it balanced in the front what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back i picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised the sound is very authentic as i have a s tube champ in excellent working order for reference as well as a deville this little amp has the classic fender tube sound with a broad punchy tone and the right amount of compression the included digital effects vibraphone delay reverb chorus and tremolo are all convincing and well executed the modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ tweed deluxe clean dirty baseman princeton clean dirty deluxe clean dirty twin and an array of british and metal amps all and all a super practice amp or mic able performance amp great job fender ps i don t review products that don t stand out as excellent
853	i prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it s inexpensive yet lightweight flexible and of more than acceptable quality the problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness which feels nice at first and feels more studio but when you re actually using the cable it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things for instance monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are for just a few bucks more i prefer pro co excellines since they have metal ends and their lifetime warranty is simpler just call sweetwater which feels nicer to me but i like these just fine easy to use very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators this tuner did just fine with the low b on a string bass some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency these cables are really the best they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect life time warrany recommended to me this is a pick to pick notes and leads it does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much i use light or medium regular size picks for strumming i really like the fit feel of this plucking pick smaller but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings you might balk at the price but i do not regret it in the least some nice picking with this pick i don t play a lot so i figured ought to last me quite a while i have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience too but the dunlop is better to me
854	compared these all in medium s on a taylor dreadnought martin sp bronze phosphor bronze martins lifespan sp dr d addario ej phosphor bronze and elixir nanoweb bronze and phospher bronze i tried them back to back switching back and forth narrowing it down to d addario and elixirs i did the same with these sets one day i d try all playing along with a cd then i d try a different set every days the elixir comes out on top best sounding of all smooth on my fingers second elixir phospher bronze last was d addario i d be satisfied with the d addario they do sound good but the elixir sounds feels better great harmonica rack for smaller harps very strong in the set when worn a must have for any folk player i ve been playing guitar more than years and have used a lot of electronic tuners the first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use the planet waves pw ct is my new favorite it is very small a little bit larger than a grape despite some of the other reviews i have used it with good results on a strat tele les paul and es electrics and on acoustics from martin gibson national resophonic and voyage air i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low e tuner i didn t expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock i have to read it upside down the pw ct is nicely out of the way even when i play an f chord with my thumb on the low e string it s so light i don t notice it s there the display is bright and easy to see in most light a bit hard to read in direct sunlight but i do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway the display is small a dime can cover most of it but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position the sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it no flat symbol bb is displayed as a the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer the display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning it s red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune for example e i found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs these are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin rough handling will probably break it i notice that the clamp is easily removed so i m guessing planet waves may sell replacements the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it it is a ratchet rather than a clamp you press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around it s meant to be left on an instrument it s small enough that you can leave it on in the case if you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better and larger choices it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget i m going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars other reviewers commented on accuracy if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display this tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary i haven t had a problem except with guitars that have built in intonation problems like old nationals and they need tweaking even after a peterson strobe soapbox especially if you are a new player do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than i have time to list being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill people that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that if ever i ve been a musician for over years i ve seen an awful lot of products come and go i don t get excited about the latest and greatest very easily but having said that this is the best idea in headstock tuners i have encountered i bought one and found it so useful i ordered two more planet waves makes good quality stuff and they make some faddish stuff this item is definitely in the good quality family it s easy to read outdoors in the daylight yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light great design planet waves excellent price go dps first time using item and it broke the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke i was really excited to have this and us it now that i transferred all my music sheet to my ipad as soon as i took it off the mic stand the round piece came off would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review but it only kept referring to delivery i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on sad
855	good strong spring and good strong materials the only improvement i would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck the protector needs to be longer as the protector ages it slips off the end if it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help i just ordered three different guitar straps online one for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself then i found this and decided to get it the strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff i got this and switched over ahhh this is a guitar strap i see why you pay more it is so soft and comfortable it looks amazing this is just a great product i would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar thanks works great but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time some responses to comments i ve seen in the reviews i ve had mine for years used moderately and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible haven t put a pad there or anything the manual screw functionality does i feel give an added level of control you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz however range of motion is on the wide side to get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic i have to put it right on the edge of the st string and screw it down all the way and it does sometimes leave some buzz the price is nice though so i would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo i bought one of snark s super tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised it will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio and one on my stage rig buy it it s a great little tuner i only just received these but thought i d give my first impression i purchased headphones because i figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in ear type i chose this model because they were on sale seemed to be a diamond in the rough and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads i wear an xl hat size the build is average they don t feel flimsy in my hands but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special strength wise the padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head it sort of looks warped the meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone the headphones can both swivel degrees forward maybe degrees back and degrees downward the swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband i listened to about minutes of music straight to start and was pretty pleased i m not especially particular but do like good sound there s some good bass classical music was clear the headphones did make me realize i had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that i tried out listening to the hd equivalent on youtube cleared up problems i heard i wasn t totally blown away either i do hear a little noise when they re plugged into my computer and nothing is playing though not so for my ipod so i m not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones they are comfortable but not as comfortable as i d like i do feel some pushing against my ears the round ear pads aren t big enough to fit my whole ear they do get warmer than i d like i definitely feel relieved to have them off i think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour i was a little hesitant to get over ear headphones in fear of this and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem who knows maybe they ll wear in and improve i ll update this review if i have more to report for now i d say they re worth the cost even if they aren t a shining diamond in the rough if i could give about stars i would but for now i ll give they are accurately priced and overall a typical quality product some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons update i ve been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days it s helped a bit what s funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge it s comfortable on my head at about the rd of the size notches but the pushing against your head is the tight part if you adjust them larger they just fall below your ears rather than loosen up also i compared them to the sennheiser hd the tascams have better sound but the sennheiser is more comfortable they re lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better update i think the box stretching has been helping i m able to wear them for about hours now before i notice them getting uncomfortable still a relatively short amount of time update the headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren t in use the comfort is marginally improving i m guessing due to the stretching out my head ears getting used to the pressure and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure however i think my rating will remain at stars the sound is good enough to give it a couple stars and the price low enough for one more however a month should be long enough for the phones to break in to a standard usable degree and that hasn t happened to my satisfaction conclusion i would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head mine is about cm circumference or us hat size and the clamping definitely leads to discomfort the round ear pads don t quite do the trick and it makes your head pretty warm it s not unbearable but if you can find an alternative it s probably best that being said note that i have only reduced stars for the fit i can t speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head and ears if these fit comfortably which i imagine they would for many people they are a star product great sounding sturdy enough build etc update a friend of mine picked up a pair of audio technica m s around the same time i bought this pair and i was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today i m not very experienced with sound quality but i felt that the m s were definitely the winner the most obvious difference was the added volume but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears the bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother and less static like etc besides the volume these differences weren t huge i had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them the point of this update is just to say that you aren t getting headphones for with the tascams you are getting very good headphones the sound of which should more than satisfy most people i think you re pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones in this case you d pay x more for the m s but i don t think you re getting x the sound quality the m s are significantly more comfortable though they do make your ears warmer and the build feels better stronger smoother adjustments prettier etc all these things combined and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable
856	strings are half the battle with stringed instruments a bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better either way stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point these strings make my cheap ukulele sound not so cheap and i imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point i also play guitar and martin is one of my choice brands for strings so i figured they wouldn t let me down when i decided to play the ukulele i was correct well constructed with quality woods saddle nut and bracing neck and frets are straight level and do not snag this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play the strings may be too high or too light or whatever just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well do not buy a luna davidson main street or any other no name get this one i can t write a great review for this there s nothing to write about this is a pick holder it holds my picks end of story price was right this is a review for themahalo u pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink for the price shipped it can t be beat free shipping via amazon prime i got it for my yo daughter for christmas and she loves it i taught her the c chord and i play the g chord so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you it s a great little starter musical instrument and a great beater uke that i don t mind getting a bit banged up i was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight well good enough for a cheap uke the strings are some kind of cheap nylon i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound x better almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost the fretboard is painted black so i don t know what kind of wood was used i didn t expect ebony for this price i also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high and now even i can play it without complaining too much it has geared tuners not friction pegs it even comes with a matching polyester gig bag now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter overall a decent play starter uke and worth the lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best great picks sampler works really well was a great price and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time the capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar
857	bought it as a gift friend loved it very much i placed mine on the back side of my amp in a safe from bump spot i keep a few picks in it for easy access and i always know where to find them the double stick tape that came on it has worked well it s a cost effective way to always have a few picks handy and not loose in a pocket getting lost try one picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me good deal will order again can t hold tightly on st string low c a little buzz good spring action made pretty solid no buzzing on the strings when i put it on the lifetime warranty is what i am stoked about i will probably buy two more for my other guitars highly recommend it
858	i love this cable it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise the cable itself does not seem quite as good quality as my other planet waves cables but it is still better than most others the switch is easy to use i love these strings i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these i really enjoyed them after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase no desire to test other strings especially after this bundle value defiantly a space saver i can put all of my effects side to side ad hook em up with these patch cables it s very convenient that they are angled like so for low profile fits my only complaint is that they easily fall out of the socket if you jostle them too much this capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no fuss with positive micro action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose removal is simple also just press the release tab and it s ready to remove no muss no fuss it really does work that well highly recommend this is one of my favorite music purchases in a while cleans up your gear s appearance tremendously very easy to use and lots of extra cable length i love these carry bags they allow me to easily carry multiple guitar stands music stands etc all at once who couldn t use an extra arm or two when moving equipment well made and a fair price too large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch the included velcro works well for me i haven t had any pedals fall off yet cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications i m careful with my stuff so the soft case suits me fine i can sling it over my shoulder and carry guitar amp all at once plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though these are great patch cables they make a strong connection between pedals and don t sacrifice any sound quality i ve been using many of these every day for quite a while and they are still working great this tuner works great i put in a volt battery a couple of months ago and it still is going strong it will take a volt output from my power supply and i can then piggyback to another pedal which is great it is very very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions you do need to hit only one string at a time however size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable price is very good i had a boss in the past but took it back because it just seemed so overpriced and too complicated this is the godzilla of volume pedals it is a beautiful massive piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as i run signal through it it appears to be indestructible i like that it has a tuner output and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver when a friend offered to sell his for bucks i bought it without hesitation i now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my ditto looper so i can fade it out volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results if you need light maybe keep looking if you don t mind the heft you will be pleased i am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the boss me multi effects pedal this unit sounds good and is adjustable it appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it there is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use there is no subtle setting on the flanger and so when it is on you know it i think it is pretty cool and i mostly use it on my fenders when i looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive no loss of initial tone with this pedal which was on my priority list as i love the sound of my guitar and amp the hall setting is phenomenal transparent in your signal chain when off as well love it well made capo works as designed on my acoustic easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings just wish it had a spring so it could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it
859	i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive these sticks are solid hickory which is insanely durable and sounds great for classic rock and punk rock drums these sticks are weight and sound matched so each pair will sound and feel almost identical looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks the pick pocket is cool though i won t be using it i am editing my earlier review i bought of these about months ago one works just fine no problems whatsoever i use it on every gig and at home the other has some kind of short in it it drains batteries almost overnight when i take the batteries out no problem tunes just fine but i am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test i contacted snark and marcy their customer service rep sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty excellent customer service they have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is i will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly
860	put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a great tough i could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here i like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole or for that matter to the headstock where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole it works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound not quite true to your guitar you will note this in particular with a classical guitar this can be balanced to some degree with your amp s equalizer and or the treble and bass settings however compared to the axl pickup which i bought for comparison the cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar for its hard to say anything bad about this gadget it s accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument the visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that s a silly extra that doesn t interfere with anything so no problem star rating based on price great for home use but dragging it on the road i dont know how long it would last
861	i got this to install it on a podium it is perfect the construction is very sturdy and it always stays in place get it if you need one this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power its easy to install and keeps things simple no more extra messy cabling glad i got it thanks to amazon for the quick delivery barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer s defects the unit does what it was meant to do i do however question whether the word pro should apply to this system although the inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about to its defense it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than feet away after playing with the device for a couple more minutes i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception even the length of the mic cord whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality yikes perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above i m afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes i ll probably be returning this unit asap running mics samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting this mixer handles it all perfectly i m literally knew nothing about it when it arrived first time i d ever seen a mixer of any kind in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly get hiss free nicely panned beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful professional and frankly better than i could have imagined i didn t need the fx but the the other was out of stock d i ll get to them one day i wish it had a power button okay well i lied in subject line bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand i can say that with authority since i run kj shows nights a week and have for the last years so i know good singers when i hear them and they will ask if i have a shure sm to which i reply hell no you think i m going to put a in the hands of a careless drunk the more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe some also drop the mic or worse spike the mic i d rather lose one of these behringers than a or a wireless sound wise these are great for their intended purpose if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic this is the bargain absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you i will get another for my monitor bought two sets both arrived together and at the expected delivery date i had bought two sets of the pyle pro pmdk months previously which also included a pair of ft cabling from an amazon dealer which arrived without problems initially i noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles personally i think its easier to setup the pyle pro pstk later comparison showed that the pstk is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker pole however the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products the paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs there were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing why i blame the manufacturer s packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and side by side within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton no other fore thought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded really how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foam on the plus side after testing each of the tripod stands all seemed to function perfectly well the units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up the price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved i would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy only time and after some use hereafter will i be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain
862	i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases you never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper cutter winder and pin puller gets the job done and it is inexpensive my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks he says it s easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder highly recommend this is an inexpensive but for the money well built case i don t have any complaints my fender strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn t the most durable case i wouldn t use it to ship my guitar it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next any product that can make an intermediate level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment the rp is an amazing processor loaded with features looper drum machine tuner and dozens of cool pre sets greasr is my favorite you can customize your own sounds but i still haven t gotten tired of digitech s choices the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential i run my ipod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes sweet the control settings can be a little daunting at first but the owner s manual will walk you through the tough stuff bottom line a great toy capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary this one has a very strong spring so i am hoping i lossens up with use i ve been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them i figured i d try some others at half the price and see if any stack up these were the first to go on and they were a huge step down from what i had on the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high e string they were twice as loud as these when you take these out of the pack they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti they don t do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do the cons definitely outweigh the pros here pros very flexible string bends are easy easy on the fingerscons the most dull sound of any strings i ve ever heard especially on the low end they re dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound the highs are very tinny almost sounds like a bad recording your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings it s the weirdest thing this is especially true for the g string it s hard to explain but it s kind of like rubbing against something really clean where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there s tons of squeak to boot anyways it sucks grip is the last thing you want on your strings bottom line unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings these should not be purchased i ll never buy again this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings i love this tuner its awesome to use and efficient the only thing i wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are to my ear it sounds good but you never know
863	ordered one of these gig bags for a new les paul the hard shell cases are back ordered and i didn t want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust fits a lp studio perfectly has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket does the job i used to be that guy that lost about guitar picks a month i bought three of these dunlop pick holders one for each of the three gauges i find myself constantly using and they ve more than paid for themselves in the short time i ve had them this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely
864	it s a good od but i thought it would be higher output and more articulate just personal preference i mean the pedal is a classic for a reason i m an acoustic player but every once in a while i break out the strat just to have some fun and get a little variety i wanted to get some of the cool s fuzz going just to play around and experiment for me this pedal was a great way to do that with electric guitar i m not a tone freak and i don t need everything to sound authentic for me this pedal gets you of the way there it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls if you re comparing this to boss fuzz pedal this one is probaly a lower build quality e g made from plastic but it s also only i m not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage so i ll gladly take the savings mxr make pretty good pedals for the money i thought that this would be a high output saturated type distortion it is not it has plent of volume which is good for boosting but even with the gain knob turned all the way up this thing is an overdrive which is not a bad thing if that s what you are looking for very mid rangey sound as well just not for me but it s well built and would make a decent od but overall a pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal really wanted to like this one because i loved the price there is no way this is true bypass the one i got was defective out of the box and so when i checked i saw the circuitry did not support pass through maybe it is because i received a defective one but i still wouldn t try this brand name i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something a very boring dull uninspiring pedal don t waste your time with this a boss sd or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range
865	i actually replaced a boss tr with this pedal does everything it is supposed to do without the perceived that s was they say volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals if it s perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds i have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because i was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off first i bought a fm dsp on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store that was my mistake i was looking for that clean fender sound without paying the big bucks well here it is friends in all it s glory tons of headroom so clean it can squeak if you want tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price it s loud it s clean and there is a fair amount of distortion in it although you have to coax the distortion out of it add a danelectro distortion pedal of some sort off amazon for distortion and you re home i own nine amps including fender crate and peavey tube models and this is cleaner if you play c w look no further if you fingerpick this is your amp electrified banjo mandolin or violin this is the amp but if you follow the darker side keep looking i ve been playing rock and blues for over years i ve owned a number of amps over the years including a s ampeg watt combo and a pre cbs watt fender showman and my latest a crate watt tube amp that i bought about years ago i also have a small peavy watt solid state combo the crate has always sounded great and it s what i use exclusively in my basement studio but it weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out despite numerous repair attempts so i ve been using the peavy when i play out the last time i did i was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else i own a line pocket pod and love it so i looked into the line amps when i found that i could get a watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than i could go through in a lifetime for less than i ordered one from amazon sight unseen and unheard out of the box i was amazed at just about everything the clean amp models are crisp and clear the dirty ones thick and rich the effects that i have played around with so far are amazing and i cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole spider iv and the thing is loud very loud as i get more experience with the amp i m sure that i m going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome i m sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a watt solid state combo with speaker as their main amp and if you ve got to spend and a roadie i guess they d be right but for the money the sound the size and the very light weight lbs alone make this a fabulous deal add in the modeling and the effects high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves and compared to my crate vc at the spider iv seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function i doubt that i will use my crate again except when guests come to jam and then the less than good it doesn t come with a foot switch you have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and or take advantage of the channels on the fly and to upload new firmware to the amp and of course you really want to do all if that and more so a foot controller is essential i opted for the fbv express mk ii the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal it lets me access all channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume wah controller it was another it is really essential so in my mind the price of the spider iv is really just under and it doesn t come with any manuals to speak of all the manuals are available online for free but of course you have to download them and print them and these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp if you do not have access to a computer and a printer i guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not i guess you re sol the advanced guide is the essential one for using the amp and is only pages long that s too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail and it s not particularly well written there a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another pages long i have not explored it much yet but i suspect that it will be written similarly once again if you do not have a computer with an internet connection there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the spider iv that you will not be able to do my guess is that it would have probably added to the list price of the amp for line to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual and at the amp would seem less attractive to many so line opted to handle things the way they did bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal very highly recommended jm tepper
866	well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack they work on stage makes decent products but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times that would have been perfect otherwise it works fine while i wish the bases came in different colors i really like these hangars they look good and perform well i hang strats on them and have not experienced any problems think i saw a video on youtube that said strat headstocks could slip easy to install and hanging and releasing is a no brainer have three of these hercules hangers i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul i have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the hercules the stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs there is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands i can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place i strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there the extra cost is well worth the investment i bought this at my local guitar shop for after looking into it the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while i was there update a few weeks ago i bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers i usually buy locally but the deal here was great the stand is worth the price and more love this amp my drummer is stoked to be able to use this product and has really enhance our music affordable and great quality i have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter most stages in bars clubs and restaurants are small enough to use mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake but not all these gls audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the months that i have been using them on an almost daily basis i have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon there was nothing wrong with my original neckplate but i was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra it was a direct replacement for the original i bought this planet wave cables because i have a electro harmonix od glove and a line m so i needed a small cable for both pedals i highly recomend this model of cables really works good with pedals and others i only had this board for a day after realizing it was a tab too narrow for the pedal setup i wanted to create on it i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro both of the stands had parts that had fallen out or were missing all together when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects this is a major concern it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control but it does make me suspicious of pyle products i bought this because i had a new baby at home and this allowed me to practice without rocking disturbing her it s affordable and does the same thing as more expensive adapters stars because it works as its described and has a nice display i like this better than my old snark it s got a better build quality than the snark for sure this thing rocks unlike other cheap chinese made ripoffs ahem behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny
867	this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality it is very clear sounding and very well built get this mic you will not regret it this comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture i love the way this mounts to power strip you can actually put several if needed side by side unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as spaces it is rated to ma but i try to keep to or less i looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly this product isn t really one to review but it does what it advertises i use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my tu great tuner by the way starting to build my pedal board so i figured better to start off with a dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a t rex fuel tank which i m planing on in the future great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks can t beat it i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat it does that my dial is set at o clock however i could see a tone purist really bothered by the the mid range coloration from this pedal in live practice situations at high volumes it doesn t bother me much in the studio i won t use this pedal for that reason it was the right price for me right now if you want transparent boost you gotta pay more one more thing a boost pedal really shines when it s running to a tube amp for that extra something i don t think pushing the input of a digital amp is a good idea for sound s sake just a thought feet is a weird length for a cable it really only has one use when you re sitting right next to your practice amp just don t wander too far off this cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his her guitar lesson and has to plug in i bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between i feel chained to my workstation just my experience get a foot and be free hope it helps this is a very quite tube and has all the gain you d expect from a great ax tube if your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick i ve been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now this pedal completed that task it s hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect very punchy and crisp you can t go wrong with behringer pedals they are plastic though so they might not hold up under heavy road use but for home studios they are perfect highly recommended got this to put into my pseudo caster project guitar love it be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model the threads are smaller on these if you like to do dive bombs you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness last important note make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up don t know why quality instruments don t come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement the next time you change your strings check and see if your current nut is plastic if so have a few of these on hand and re place that nut you will hear the difference and they don t wear out like plastic just make certain you get the height correct so your action isn t too high rule of thumb grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height you can always remove more material but you can t put it back on this is a quick easy improvement i have bone on all of my guitars
868	it is a good price works fine to connect my wha wha pedal to my ampli stars because nothing is perfect but i m happy with it this stand really is pretty tough i have carries it in my gig bag and it has been thrown around and stepped on etc still works great soume times you just need a transformer based low amperage power supply for pedal where the switchmode based modern supplies are just too noisy this was the cheapest so it goes if you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar i would suggest this i have a vintage s dixon hummingbird i was really worried about scuffing it up don t worry with this
869	they add depth to your bass drum by muffling the overtones a bit and it is the pads that wear out rather than your bass drum head so these actually save you money and sound better i ve used a couple different brands and they pretty much are similar just slipped this windscreen on my mic a wireless brand and it barely fit perfectly any smaller and it would be going in the trash the foam is obviously of good quality and it s plenty thick i m using it mainly to protect the mic s metal screen but also to keep others germs off the mic seeing as how they tend to put their mouths on it this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all cymbals that i possess and use very brilliant and resonant definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price trust this cymbal once and you won t be disappointed it lasts a pretty long while too it s a thin splash so it does tend to break after about months of use er so but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there all in all i definitely recommend trying this product this worked out of the box i have two xlr misc one keyboard and a guitar connected and its very easy to balance the levels there is no noise or other problem so far great for my family looking to buy more soon
870	this is a beautiful shock mount however for the price it didnt perform the mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on p s and s s not worth the price im starting a podcast i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this great for voice overs in sound proof studios the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise the ability to select the recording modes is great if youll use it i would not reccomend recording people at once on this however recording a choir or something would work but i will never do that and neither will you this microphone only has a usb port not xlr so no hope of expanding if you ever want to host a podcast with people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and new microphones or you can do what i did and get audio technica atr s behringer xenyx dual mic input mixer shock mount broadcast boom combos and windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand now i can replace my mixer and keep my mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for hosts on my podcast do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever this arm hold the weight of a atr microphone fine it stays where you put it and it works as you would expect the packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works the shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts i did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me however it works great not too big and gets the job done tip just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit my atr is a inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around inches i just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great
871	what s to say it s not a high end capo and for the price i can lose it like most of the other capos i have owned it s not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly i ve been playing guitar for about years and within the last year bought my first taylor guitar taylor guitars ce ltd grand auditorium acoustic electric guitar it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory i am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce what s even better is how long they last i m pretty hard on my strings i usedunlop standard tortex picks pack purple mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly the nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several months instead of weeks they re a little bit more expensive then other major string brands but after about a year of listening to these only gone through sets so far they re worth the extra few bucks normal pickguard screws nothing special here you do get a nice amount for the money though so this is still a good if not great deal good to buy for stocking up with just don t expect anything special because of the fender name i never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my american standard strat what interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before these are easy to install and simple to use all you need is a mm socket and your are set as others have pointed out these are staggered so there are long ones and short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way it only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove i ve read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but i don t even notice the difference they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
872	this is the best capo i ve ever owned it s a little awkward in that it doesn t just clip to the headstock with one hand and it takes me two hands also to put it on but not having to retune my string makes it all worthwhile i like the choice of colors too the rat has been used by everyone from david gilmour to dave grohl to give you a grasp of its range it does everything from light crunch to marshall style thick rhythms to all out face melting distortion rich harmonics near infinite sustain and a mid range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal this pedal has not left my board since the day i bought it the fact that it s built like a tank ensures it s going to be around a long time after my playing days are over this pedal really hits the spot warm vintage analog slap back delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate which if you are a fan of johnny greenwood you will love i also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound with the modulation on and very short delay time sounds almost like a phaser updated after owning the i for over a year and encountering many difficulties i am revising my once gleaming review the i is a simple set up pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs connect a mic or apparently a low headroom instrument to it run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand alone program and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug ins section of ableton but i figured it out eventually regardless ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly sometimes the i seems to lock up completely so as no audio is being produced from my monitors i wasn t sure for a very long time if this was user error an ableton problem or the fault of the i and its drivers so after the gazillionth crash i screamed ballsdogit and purchased a license for reaper after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months i began to realize that my monitors no longer lock up but that the drivers for the i are indescribably pathetic i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors now i m in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers garbage focusrite everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug ins and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface i have yet to experience a crash but i also have yet to experience any recording time seriously i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the i and came across a response from david focusrite actually saying that you should not use this setup to record electric guitar and that if you need to record electric guitar you should get something with more headroom like the i that is just unbelievable in my eyes i m sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle besides that i ll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and instrument ins there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology how in the heck does this thing have a nearly star rating the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm i have a bunch of different mics and the i when not crashing or locking up the monitors seems to handle all of them well i constantly check for driver updates and have the latest drivers for the i but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett i is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out
873	i m sure this isn t the best echo pedal or even in the top but it serves it s purpose fairly well stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn t something that most of us can t live with for us it s worth taking the risk imhoupdate the pedal gave up the ghost died in a relatively short amount of time i replaced it with mini modtone type delay i actually like the dano sound better but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals cheap mass produced housed in a plastic casing but the fab series offers affordable effects to at surprisingly good quality and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost times more if this pedal cost i might gripe about how tight together the input output v jacks are i might also complain about the weird position of the mix speed and depth controls on the top of the unit or the small footswitch but at this price for it to sound this good i can t complain at all don t expect the fab series to be good at everything but if there s and effect out there that you only use once in awhile especially anything involving modulation or delay the fab series is going to do it well and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals it s just a great option to have for casual budget guitarists although i have a pedal board with effect pedals there are additional effects on my amplifier i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button is sturdy and good for price first of all this is a guitar stand it s not a high end pro stand that being said the materials are decent it seems strong and stable i would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig i bought it to have a convenient place to keep our guitars and basses handy rather than having individual stands this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neat the metal is decent but if you tighten the screws too much the metal does flex warp so far so good no manual you can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it s price i purchase such so i could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live don t believe this is what it is mean t for a simple delay looper will suffice this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs
874	obviously these aren t top of the line strings but i used them to record a track in drop c and it sounded awesome after about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin d addario is awesome if you keep in mind that they re on the cheaper side the one spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts get it you won t be sorry strings i use d addario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great they have a really nice sound and don t cost an arm and a leg it s light and has great sound for interviews i would recomende this mic for any station and we are z net visit us on the web and hear it live decent quality cheap price we ll see how long it lasts but for now does the trick i think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand this little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such but don t expect it to last forever as is typical with behringer products at least it s cheap though i just wish it had a power switch they work well but they are not mogami that being said i use them in my rig and bought some for my brothers we both seem pretty happy with it i have two delay pedals both inexpensive this one and a behringer and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap behringer the danelectro sounds more natural the behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal which is perfectly ok for some applications the danelectro has a warmer almost analog feel it sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos the case is plastic but unless you eat times your weight at the golden corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet you re not going to break it the only thing i don t like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it i suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the retro look of this pedal ok fine i ve heard pedals costing twice as much that don t sound as nice as this one as one reviewer once wrote there are guitarists who would rather catch aids than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board i however think some of these cheap pedals function quite well and in some cases just as well as their more expensive counterparts if you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your holy grail ocd and other boutique pedals i promise the other ones won t catch aids from this in fact the whole ensemble will benefit
875	i really dislike the switch on this thing it does not click that may not sound like much but i tend to rest my foot on a pedal when i turn it off this does not turn off when i do that this is unlike any pedal i have played i realize behringer is trying to copy the mxr but the switch substitution makes me wish i picked up a used mxr anyway the pedal sound fine just know the switch may drive you insane i really like the other behringer boss type pedals though as the switch is what i like wish the phase came in a different case bought it after read reviews i had signal loss using these cables it s like having a loose connection inside the cable my connections were on and off i thought i had a dead pedal i have to wiggle and hold to get signal it s too flexible almost like twizzlers no kidding if you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables go get the one from pro co i bought it very cheap from sweetwater on ebay surprisingly very good quality and looks durable it stopped working after gigs i m not sure why but it is very frustrating i guess you get what you pay for here
876	i was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i m glad with hosa quality it feels reliable and without adding noise i ve had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven t failed me once i love them and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so they rotate in full circles and are super durable you should buy them for all your guitars and you ll never have to worry again they are also very easy to use and install i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures cheaply made but functional keep a couple of these in the bag as spares they will be handy if you know who shows up to the gig without a strap while not as soft and supple as suede straps i am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well the button holes were a little tight but thats not a bad thing it is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot it is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker all in all it s a good strap for the money which wasn t much
877	great as a booster as others have said for solos it ll boost your mids and your signal as an overdrive it s great kind of a midsy marshally sound it does suck out some of the low end but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever it s a boss it s solid and a great price remember this is overdrive not distortion for distortion look at other boss pedals love this pedal the mod button just makes it sound like tremolo to me and i have great classic fender tremolo on the amp i use so i don t use that option much i just use it for when i want a little slap back and it works great for that and provides a real nice analog tone just got it so far so good i use delay pretty light n tight slapback vibe not too wet this does it well i considered the mxr delay no i may have considered it but the only pedal failure i ve ever experienced was my mxr dunlop phase first the dc input then the stomp switch after light barely any bedroom use this modtone here seems solidly constructed i haven t played with it too much yet but as of right now i wouldn t recommend it for edge wannabes seems limited in that regard i may be wrong but either way do we need more edge wannabes no we do not good tone though does the trick trick i have been using this gig bag for the past few months if i do the math i probably didn t use it more than times basically from home to the subway from the subway to the studio and back so maybe minutes walk each time so i used it for about hrs and minutes mostly carrying it on my shoulders sometimes by one of the two handles then the side handle started coming apart the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking which i kind of expect at this point meanwhile i m going to buy another sturdier gig bag save your money and get something better than this
878	how do you review an sm i ve used these most of my life and will continue to very durable i got this to replace the same a year old rusted dented grill i also use a d akg same price and a line wirelesss but the is always reliable first choice or backup it is a good purchase i expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job i would like the plate to be heavier seems a little flexy i ve used this pedal with a casio px keyboard for about weeks now pros sturdy construction compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards polarity switch i was using a yamaha fc with an older keyboard but the fc does not work properly with the casio keyboards it s a tip negative polarity and the privia requires a tip positive polarity so the piano would operate in reverse sustain on until the pedal is depressed thankfully the sp has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard cord is long enough con build quality is slightly less than the fc the fc has a smooth action made in japan but the sp had some problems with the metal spring squeaking some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking the sp also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal overall it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals this seems like a good deal for the price i have concerns about durability for anyone who has to frequently adjust the boom or takes it on the road because that boom adjustment joint is a bit flimsy i bought it for home studio use by just me so i am totally satisfied i bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard it was already assembled right out of the box and seems well padded and sturdy my daughter likes it i like the price because of the special deal from amazon this is my third bench and seems to be the best of them quick to set up tear down adjust the bench is also larger than my others very happy for the price different height adjustments i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed the cable itself is a bit rubbery and not slinky like some of the higher grade microphone cables but so far they have held up fine the cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier these stands are great for my lesson business i bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight
879	i have to tell you guys these xlr cables that i have received recently are by far the best quality cables i have ever encountered in my entire music professional life i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues these mopads are pretty amazing i recently just purchased the atlantic gaming desk so i had a feeling that i would need these pads these pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk i love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing it s like i m using actual studio monitors at you can t go wrong with these pads for you studio it is a must to have these i was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal i only wanted this so that i could pair it with my re to control the intensity and in that aspect i can confirm that it works pairs flawlessly my only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive for example i tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a vst synthesizer and it was recognized and mapped without issue but rocking the pedal ever so slightly would cause erratic movement on the filter this is the same behavior that i have when connected to the re in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that s anything but gradual it s not the end of the world but i was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers well after starting to use it on windows x i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings i went to the behringer website i found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use windows i am using this with a behringer fx mixer it is a good combo the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough i treat my gear with care i figure it ll probably last for years and years and years i am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation i bought the ts version of these cables and they have served me well these are of the same quality and a great value for the price these are your basic speaker stands for pa systems they re functional durable and can be set up within just a few seconds i would have given this a higher rating however upon receipt one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight i had set the tension while inspecting the bag i found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand further inspection confirmed this as this block was indeed part of the tube and after several minutes of wrestling with it i was able to get it lodged back inside the block was part of the tension mechanism and once it was forced back into the tube the stand s performed flawlessly as a classical guitarist i have never touched a pick to my nylon strings as a recent ukulele enthusiast however i have a little different approach in a group if all are acoustic a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers i tried these nothing against them they are good for strumming for lead i needed to use something harder i went to a soft plastic or nylon pick it will still not be too good for the strings but it does the sonic job i need for a nice strum these are fine
880	i purchased this when it was on sale during the christmas season i figured that for the asking price at the time i could not go wrong my expectations were frankly low i had heard nothing but horrible things about epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability what i received was the polar opposite i received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when i unboxed it i am not wild about the strings that came stock but i am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums i guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads in the near future i intend to restring the guitar withd addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar strings light which while thick should make the instrument jazz friendly i realize that flatwound strings will require a new set up and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investment out of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared to my novice eyes and fingers to be properly dressed i have already invested in a good but not great case guardian hardshell electric guitar caseto store the guitar i also uploaded a customer provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits for the record i use the following amp which i have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar kustom defender watt class a guitar headthat i run through akustom the defender x guitar extension cabinet for h head bottom line this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players the price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year cut the strings like they was made of paper really good price did what it was suppose no need to say anymore it is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music i really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you
881	forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand doubt i ll use the strap but then again i probably will try to use it that way i bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my fender acoustic these are easy to install using the instructions or without these are also sturdy and look very good schaller guitar strap locks work really really well however i had problems at first until i made some changes first off you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen the blue stuff will be more than enough second the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn loosen the screw over time kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar so when i install the new button i put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first never had one unscrew again if you do those things first you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident ever but you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock this is a nice strap it feels really durable i like the black side and the soft leather side it feels good around my shoulders
882	there are several types of practice amps high end modlers line g dec vox vt that can still run and are typically overloaded with features the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v peavey valveking etc these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality and then there are the micros i always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas boy was i wrong i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear he s not a big kid so even lb amps are pushing it plus a gig bag and school back pack that was initially what brought me to the micro not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso turns out this is an amazing amp the tone destroys the line and the features crush the vox pathfinder watt or bug v and the fender frontman not even in the ballpark each of the models are distinct the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate obviously this isn t a loud amp but that s not all bad you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes it also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously for example i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy don t let the size fool you i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i couldn t have been more wrong there are several big websites and it s tough to find any negatives about this amp quality sounding and durable for a great price oh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades that is what i wanted but that is also why i got it weathered to speed up about years of personality i m not sure how you would wear it out really its buttery soft and doesn t have a strange fabric suede backing so it won t muck up your clothes pill or crumble the only minus is that its a standard inches though the description says its long pretty standard vs all other straps i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural it looks wonderful i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it update since i got the strap as a christmas gift i ve worn it to class and jam sessions i started getting nice compliments about the guitar thought the guitar is beautiful i ve had it for a while i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar beauty and function nothing special here if you don t like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you don t want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise there are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you don t want the logo on the front of the guitar neck headstock you could even flip it inside out and have the soft leather side exposed i subtracted a star because i think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic not bad but i had intended on leaving this on my instrument i bought a few for different basses and guitars but the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag no problem with hard cases leaving the battery dead when i took the instrument out of the case the switch should be on the side of the unit fwiw i like my snarks better faster and more stable tuning a near miss with the ns the cable tangles easily not stiff enough it get s in the way and is hard to stay stretched out but the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types it also seem tightly put together at the ends
883	as another guy said how could i live without this pedal before i agree with that i got two of these one for my base guitar one for my guitar simply outstanding simply the best thank u mxr these are pretty good quality tweed cables i prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs they also make one with the degree inch input as well i ve been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far i use it boost my jazz bass to the same volume level as my precision it does the job perfectly the led is really bright which for me is a good thing but others might find distracting also it would convenient if there were external switches instead of internal dip switches for varying the settings but in such a small footprint there are bound to be tradeoffs i d buy this again for sure this is the first and only tc electronic product i ve ever purchased i watched the youtube demos and liked what i heard it has exceeded my expectations the reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak the toneprint feature is amazing i downloaded church of andy preset from the tce website and just love that patch downloading is quick and easy i created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available hall of fame patches so whenever i want to change it out i don t even have to go on the internet to get it there is an iphone ipod gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal don t ask me how it works but it does i will probably buy more tc electronic pedals in the future i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc after my first test recording when i played back the audio using the built in speaker i really thought that i had been duped into believing this device was studio quality then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow this has got to be heard to be believed there are so many applications for this recorder it s ease of operation and quick start up time make it ideal for hurried set ups tc just does things right i love how easy this is to use the incredible clarity of sound and minutes of recording time i do a single duo and full band it goes with me to all gigs and i do use it for when i am practicing highly recommended solution i was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once i do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on the only issue i have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune red bar but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat so for me it is a quick check while i am in between songs anything with bars or more will get more attention
884	this is a great pedal to have in your setup for those times you want a clean sound that will cut through the mix yet will not just sound blaringly loud and undefined i used a boss compression pedal for many years and the dyna comp was definitely a refreshing step in the right direction it just sounds more organic and less sterile than the boss pedal i also think in this case less is more as far as the controls are concerned thing is great for multi pedal use this is a must if you have any of the danelectro fab pedals as anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat volts like candy you purchase the power supply search for danelectro da v ac adapter and this cable and you re good to go for up to pedals no more battery swaps i bought this because i had a new baby at home and this allowed me to practice without rocking disturbing her it s affordable and does the same thing as more expensive adapters
885	i have the small version but for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more i used in all my concerts and its excellent recommended i ordered two of these based on the review and indeed this guitar strap deserves stars it feel like leather but i am not it is true leather however at a piece i have to give it stars i used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily this one does not twist saves me lot of times especially during gigs i will order two more i have different kind of guitars acoustic classical electric and bass it fit all of them this tuner is cool it picks up even the lightest vibrations i e i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out i also like the capo tuning feature you put a capo on the rd and tell the tuner to flatten x i highly recommend this tuner this guitar is pretty good for the price the only reason it has stars is because my first and nd string keep detuning might be the weather but strangely it keeps tune in dadgad i think i may need to tighten some screws anyway not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical this is an attractive leather head stock strap the leather is very soft and flexible i would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather
886	pros price point good clean audio quality when working changeable mesh ballscons limited upper frequency response khz one stopped working after about half an hour of use it was not dropped or abused in any way requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than feet these mics are great i wasn t sure what they would be like but i would buy them all again they are cheap enough to replace and they sound great we shure mics and they needed repaired all the time these have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all pros price point does the job in the descriptioncons shielding of usb cable is abysmal very susceptible to interference could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it cheap plastic construction i originally rated this pickup stars however after using it for some time on dulcimers a mandolin and acoustic guitars some problems have turned up basically the cherub is just too sensitive it works well at lower volumes but as soon as you crank it up feedback city that you can not stop easily i put a rubber inner tube from a bike to reduce the sensitivity but still feed back and funny sound if you are looking for a pickup to use at a dance or some other loud venue the cherub will likely squeal as you crank it up it sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup you can talk into your instrument
887	these are not the greatest but they re cheap and they get to you fast when you need them i ve only had one fail and i ve bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio amazon is the first place i go when i need cables for audio video computers or concert lighting good music to all behringer makes quality products i purchased the excellent c condenser microphone and replaced the usb with the xenyx mixer board when i researched items for a simple home recording setup i saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer and read the item description here on amazon and the behringer website for the c mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the behringer phantom powered mixer boards that was incorrect information this board receives power only via usb and doesn t provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics v when i setup the return of this board to amazon i informed of the error and the appear to have acted very promptly on it as the item description for the c on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for volts although this correction is good it would be more helpful to customers if behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power i ve noticed in other venues i e musician and sound forums behringer gets a bad rap i don t think its due to poor quality equipment i think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale neither the behringer website nor the included documentation with the items i bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts often we get what we pay for after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks i chose solid items for reasonable prices i should ve known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle the quality of the cable this item simply didn t ever work it arrived with a bent pen on one end and even when we attempted to straighten it it didn t connect well onto the mixer board the microphone end was a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic don t buy this item spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand i bought this for my son so he could record with it he does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him
888	these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not i put these s on all of my strats regardless of the brand they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great i tend to play my strats a bit rougher than my gibson s or acoustics so these are well tested in my house i get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit i will continue using these on all of my strats until i find something better which i haven t yet i do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well these are bullet proof they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it a day doesn t go by where the stand is not in use i use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my imac the simplicity of this mic is very nice the sound quality is also very decent i haven t ever used one of those professional quality ones but this has not disappointed me so far the only complaint i have is that there is no on off switch the only way to turn it off is to unplug it other than that i totally recommend this microphone it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble it comes with aaa batteries i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later all guitarists know that there are billion strat copies out there they vary a bit but basically you have a light pickup versitale guitar that does that job that is about it but this legacy which i can see as i am typing is much more first the natural finish is what got me started it seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads i looked at fenders but except for the natural finish what was i getting for i wanted a strat copy that i could customize this is it i am putting split hot rail type pickups in this and wow i have a strat pickup lp and anything in between get one for some reason when i saw picks i think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks what i got was a slim resealable bag that s about th the size i was thinking of it comes with light medium and heavy picks even the light picks are thicker than the thin picks i had ordered before i like having the variety though this has a variety of colors as well as the thickness the only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so i could maybe hang it from my strap
889	this fender cable is the perfect length for me sometimes i find it a bit too long but i don t mind the build quality is great and i know that it will last the only gripe i have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily requiring me to tighten it often sound quality is not affected and the color is cool definitely try this cable out they upgraded my tele deluxe they fit perfectly yet you have to push really hard on the finish at the headstock for it to go in without opening any holes on the wood these are a must have item heretofore i ve been using the planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism while it s an innovative system that doesn t require any installation the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things i installed the schallers on my warmoth strat body i found that i needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit not a big deal at all these schallers are exactly what i wanted stars and a no brainer i have schaller security strap locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase schallers for that one soon these give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place my larrivee rs came with these and converted me to schaller i gave this strap lock a star only because it is too large for me and is not interchangeable with all of my schaller locks it is a great lock and works fine but is not for me
890	everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another i have a personal preference for the xlr ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside first to slide down the cable with a legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters unfortunately that design isn t used here but i chose to award the star rating for value because you get of good quality shielded cable with xlr ends m and f for well under ft as for pinout it s straightforward pin is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends while pins and are run isolated between both ends the end design chosen uses the single set screw connector the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart and the rubber bumper design on the back which i haven t had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer s kit because they will be used not if but when the need arises another favorite of mine is the pack of foot male to female cables which do use my favorite xlr ends mentioned above which amazon will rush you gls audio ft patch cable cords xlr male to xlr female black cables balanced snake cord pack these are very easy to open an end change phase lift ground or input someone s oddball source signal having on hand means you won t quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix back to pyle s product here i basically took away star for not using the easy to open and re wire xlrs but gave them a star for value in the product since it s feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot it s also great when someone yells it s too short i need a cable stretcher at the podium and quickly adds feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn t planned for or got moved quit working for the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing i finally equipped my cable kit with the usual xlr to rca trs hi z transformers and the above mentioned pack of foot cables to quickly gain access to the xlr terminals if need be plus of these foot cables mainly to solve distance problems and a roll of gaffer s tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards i used to have ea foot xlr cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now i have one left for my kit with all that i had to build an emergency xlr to mm ts all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin even though all this was under it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on so a bit of what if thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner s daugher s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made it will no doubt be needed again and since you made it you ll know why how and where it was used before thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem people think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position my only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn t serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted xlr pin stereo y splitter to dual trs female cable i made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry i chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when i setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that stereo channel in rehersal at the console nice to keep your mic nice and fresh plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath decent value i bought mine used when i got it in it didn t work there was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board behringer uses a custom power supply so i had no way of testing it i had to send it back for a refund i read other reviews that have had the same problem so it seems to be an occasional issue however i ve used one of these boards before the one i used back then was fantastic and everything i needed for small projects this is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast especially if you are using any of the xenyx or other behringer brand mixers it also works with other mixers as well this is a great inexpensive way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me comes in a really nice case works great great price very light can t speak to durability because haven t had them long and haven t used them heavily
891	finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in finally died a great pedal well made though i d warn if you don t know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de esse the whole thing but between the pop filter and a slightly off center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses s from making an appearance in any way after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually i used to devote so much time to sitting there winding forever by hand with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time it also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts that on the bottom e i did a double take it is almost invisible thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one re stringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread not at all this pedal works well and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation a little goes a long way with the sliders and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq it makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other ten bands is a little overkill for guitar three of them are outside the range of the instrument but i bought this one because i like that it blinks if clipping it has the extra volume and gain sliders and comes with the ac adaptor this adds no noise that i can tell except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there it s an all around quality product that i imagine i ll still have twenty years from now i have schaller security strap locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase schallers for that one soon these give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place my larrivee rs came with these and converted me to schaller i use this guy with a fender twin since overdrive sound is not enough for now a days metal not much of noise and practical carry if you really want to go for something a bit more marshall jcm like get a mxr custom badass distortion for a extreme get a riot there are some things in this life that you don t want to have to think about and your tuner is one of them you have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner it is fast reliable and looks great on the pedal board it is true bypass and doesn t add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all your brand preference will guide your decision but don t shy away from this well made piece of equipment i would buy it again i use the cable great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great i like the smooth fabric sleeve it doesn t stick to things like a plastic rubber cable can this straplock set doesn t come with any instructions that s because it s so easy you don t need them took the original screws off my fender strat set the button screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in afterwards screwed the lock into mygibson lightning bolt style inch safety guitar strap jet blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was ready it is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock won t come loose by accident by any chance still haven t given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes i can tell i made the right purchase way recommended it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp it allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonics partials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental my initial thought was that it did away with the blurriness of the low bass to mid range response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitar s range amazing what a piece plastic can do highly recommended when i bought this pedal i was thinking a heavy distortion but when i got it and played with it i figured out it was alot different that advertised it is a acdc steve vaughn kind of pedal it s got an attitude but it soft at the same time it s truly a one of a kind product i would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal make a note it is not a metal pedal not by any means actually but for what it is it is fantastic i normally use my korg foot switch tuner for my guitar and basses this guy really had me believing in small vibration tuning three key words for this accurate small inbeat
892	spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier these can t support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily they sure are portable though not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades that is what i wanted but that is also why i got it weathered to speed up about years of personality i m not sure how you would wear it out really its buttery soft and doesn t have a strange fabric suede backing so it won t muck up your clothes pill or crumble the only minus is that its a standard inches though the description says its long pretty standard vs all other straps i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural it looks wonderful i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it update since i got the strap as a christmas gift i ve worn it to class and jam sessions i started getting nice compliments about the guitar thought the guitar is beautiful i ve had it for a while i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar beauty and function i love the tone do your research though plenty of distortion plenty of bass and treble makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter nice reverb can get all of the reverb sounds you want got to play with it but i got dialed in easy i always wanted a boomerang iii looper which at almost was not really a justifiable expense for me then i found this for about and i immediately sprung for it this is a great practice tool all it does is make loops the learning curve is very low and there s no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total minute recording time there are no quirky timing issues to be found here your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops this does take some getting used to but it makes you a much better musician in the process your drummer and bassist will thank you this could possibly even be used as a live performance tool although you d have to be very very proficient with this tool and be playing very very tightly in the pocket i personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this lest something go wrong on stage and lest i subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick students would be especially encouraged to get one of these my playing has definitely grown and improved since i finally broke down and bought a looper
893	i thought i was using good guitar cables but i kept getting intermittence with one so i tried this monster cable it eliminated the problem my only minor complaint is that it is very stiff this is minor but no matter what i do it curls up unless you have it fully extended i would still recommend it though nice cables so far i ve not had any problems with them but haven t put them through a lot of use just yet also have the monster audio cables that work just as well but cost more i ll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other a little large and not really light but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap very well made although the bag is a little lower quality sturdy enough to hold a big binder page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable goes up and down and tilts back no slippage my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it it s been in heavy use hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and i don t think we ve even had to replace the batteries yet it s got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust we tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn t loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust this one is great bought this rosin to see how i would like it i have a very light hand on the bow so i like a rosin that is on the aggressive side this is not since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial error this tuner is cool it picks up even the lightest vibrations i e i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out i also like the capo tuning feature you put a capo on the rd and tell the tuner to flatten x i highly recommend this tuner if you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it i ve tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer it is great for a quick way to get electrified lead wire is not very substantial but if it breaks in the future hopefully i can just buy another one to get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp
894	the name martin says it all has for many many years grab some extras because you will want more great price great strings this pedal is a must have for any pedal board i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best i put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time great strings and great value i bought this to tune my string without using the end jack the headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough feel the tone of each string with only minor plucking i use it on chromatic but it includes bass uke and guitar too
895	currently my favorite pick it s thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle i d recommend to guitarists for jazz fusion or the like i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks obviously they weren t they re as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but it s still not too bad i collect picks or plectrums if you re a purist and i do so for a good reason i don t use the same pick for the same sort of playing style i tend to use some picks for jazz some for blues some for metal and so on not all picks are made the same some are far better than others the dava master control pick dmcp is a very nice useful pick i ve been enjoying it for heavy strumming or as the metalheads call it chuggin i like its thin center and the way it is overall contoured which makes holding it a delight to my forefinger thumb another thing i really like about it is the metal tip which some folks may not enjoy as it does give a bit of a metallic tone when it touches the strings this is especially true when you ve just replaced your old guitar s strings for new ones depends on how you like it or not whether you like that metallic ting i do for certain passages the pick s construction seems to be fairly rigid yet it has potential to do more than merely chug again on the low e a strings dmcp is definitely a plectrum that i will be using a lot of in the future and not just for hard core metal but also for subtle tones in jazz passages with the distortion off overall i give the dmcp out of stars for being what it claimed it was and for being something that i will find great utility for in years to come have used it on a couple of ukuleles on my old dirty beginner uke that had been sitting in a closet unused for years it really made it look like new again i m satisfied as another guy said not better not bad simply different it s true i have dunlop classic wah beautiful and it sounds good but there are certain feautures in this one and in the dunlop that i do not like dunlop has a little bit of more wah range than behringer i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it more expensive than the behringer to my ears kinda affect just a little bit the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer cheaper does not affect the tone of your guitar at all very transparent more features than dunlop wha sound is not like the dunlop s it is different but nice i personally like so bottom line im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic good deal just get it i highly recommend it thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt this thing works great i play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable accurate and quick great for between song quick tuning it s a boss pedal so it is rugged and reliable i have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros recording artists and session musicians in and around the dallas and north texas area i play locally and regionally in north texas and see this pedal on almost every guitarist and bassist s boards every night great product well made worth every penny update after using this tuner for a month i can say that i made the right decision fantastic product that every guitar player needs period edit i have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board these really are the best tuners out there you should get one today there is no comparison to anything else out there nothing i have looked i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc after my first test recording when i played back the audio using the built in speaker i really thought that i had been duped into believing this device was studio quality then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow this has got to be heard to be believed there are so many applications for this recorder it s ease of operation and quick start up time make it ideal for hurried set ups

adjustable arm is very flexible yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement tremendous mic love the case and shockmount being all inclusive got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home portable studio love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic i run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear does exactly what you want it to do it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand it s easy to set up and easy to take down if you re looking for a mic stand buy this one you really can t go wrong this mixer is perfect for the price that is specified although the blue led power light is near blinding the overall quality and functionality of this product is fantastic i would suggest this anyone who is on a budget and would want a good quality mixer i previously had the uca and it worked great for me for a couple of years but i noticed the audio went dead in one of the rca phono input jacks i had used those jacks previously with no issues regardless i liked the uca so much that i got the uca to replace it without hesitation plus as a bonus it s purdier plugged it in just now fired up the pc the new uca started working immediately no muss no fuss for the money i don t think you can find a better deal for enhancing your pc s audio versatility i don t know if i ll even bother with the included software as i use a great program called mixcraft btw check that out if you re looking for pc recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other costlier guys anyway two thumbs way up for the uca
897	i used this on my guitar tone and volume pots and it clears up the crackle feels a little oily but gets the job done and you don t have to replacethe potentiometers so i bought this to replace the original string winder i had that doesn t have a clipper on the end and it turned out great the clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better thank you planet waves i ve been using these strings for years tried a bunch of others as well but these suckers keep coming out on top probably will never stop buying them once i used these picks for the first time i never could use different picks ever again and its a great price buy them
898	it winds it cuts you really can t go wrong here another really well made product from planet waves that will become an indespensable part of your guitar setup purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings my son much prefers the elixir strings they last a lot longer than the blue steel strings did and he says the elixir sound better too these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well color and appearance is a personal thing i think these abalone picks just look cool the color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone fender makes a nice standard pick the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy these mediums work well for playing electric guitar i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex those work well for acoustic i ve used dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the dava rubber coated picks they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick the gray dunlop s don t look anywhere near as cool as these at for a dozen they re worth a try it they don t work out for playing they sure look darn nice the fender logo is in gold dava grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey mm some folk don t like these because sometimes they come off when knocked but i like them have few of them they don t squeeze the strings tight and importantly they look cool don t buy cheap cables they just rob your tone these are the best cables for the money sure you ll spend a few more bucks but they sound great hold up and are guaranteed for life what else could you ask for all i will use are these cables i am an acoustic guitar addict with five six string and one twelve i play every day and in a year s time i go through a lot of strings over the years i have come to favor the phosphor bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument for a long time i believed that brands of them were interchangeable so i bought whatever was available at the best price no more these d addarios are the sweetest easiest to play and not that this is the most important variable to me the longest lasting of any of the phosphor bronze strings i have used there is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened martins gibsons ghs adamas and elixirs as well as other varieties of d addario strings i think it s time to sell them off these exp s are superior to them all i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong to play as well as i am able i require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up sound wise i look for a blend of brightness and warmth on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar these d addarios do both things and do them well other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the slickness of these strings i simple did not experience that at all as with all guitar strings they should be wiped with a dry lint free cloth after each and every playing not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable i bought sets and plan to use them all both mediums and lights for my stringed friends they are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them i had earnie ball on previously and i might switch back or go to dunlop witch i put on my sting and love but i probably won t get these again ever this is a great addition to any stereo system today assuming you still use your turntable two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play free of any annoying pops or clicks it won t save a dirty record you ll have to buy a cleaning solution for that but this brush will easily take care of dust hair and other particles that get attracted to your lps during regular use as another reviewer suggested i do the first pass with the brush going with the record as if i was spreading out paint or something like that and that gets most of the surface particulate free the second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record after that your record will sound brand new again there are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options but none that are this easy and this cheap i usually use extra lights because my fingers are wimps i like the bottom e to go down to a small i have heard though that you get more oomph bass and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings so i decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo and researched strings for it and i read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the light mediums were a happy medium and a good balance when i got my martin d m i cleaned it up and then restrung it with a set of these light mediums at first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast but that is because i am adding width to the e string to ouch i just have to build up my callouses which will take a few weeks of torture ugh but the sound is awesome part of it is the martin guitar of course but these strings when i hit the g chord ring out with a deep warm and long sustaining bass thump you feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings the th th and th the treble strings bend pretty easily no buzzing they have no coating so they squeak like hell tip i put a molecule or of hand lotion on my fingertips minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down these strings are great i recommend them i will try and update my review months from now and let you know about their longevity etc elixir s nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings are the best strings i ve ever used on my alvarez acoustic a guitar i ve now owned for over years they certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there they have a nice punchy tone and are easy on the fingers unlike the elixir extra lights that i found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short scale guitar these seem like an ideal combination i may buy another set soon and restring the short scale instrument with lights compared with some brands and gauges of more old school strings there may be a little less bass response but these sound good pretty even through the set and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low e string i was still searching for a pick to replace the ones i left somewhere i knew these were not the ones i sought but they are great they don t move around in my hand i have yet to drop one and for the first time i noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar these sound great i ve found a new favorite pick small light weight stunning fender blackface looks warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive the digital voicing is direct and easy to set up the fact that fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me it is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio the direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder mixer and still give you the amp s skeaker as a monitor for yourself what could be easier and it mikes well too by the way the choice is yours there with no led display cost increase if one was there and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive it s so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun and practicle too the voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates the tweed blackface and marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp love the reverb in the fx section the spring reverb is so well done that i bumped the amp once and was looking for the spring chrash known from amps with the real spring reverb it s that good once again the controls are easy and direct never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort who cares if it doen t have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection you want that go waste your money on a line or something this champ is made for one thing to give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort i believe it has accomplished that well again a shame that fender has dropped this model from the line up of products the super model is a step up in power and speaker size but also the cost is higher as well i m just glad that i got one of these from amazon com when i did and will not part with the amp been playing for five decades now and i know when i have a good instrument or gear and when i don t this model is a keeper to be sure and i don t even like digital how s that for an endorsement it s that good for what it does kenny wayne shepherd blue on black nail the lead use a strat in the neck position gets close enough to fake it for a club band sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from chicago iron this pedal will save you or more from the ci model and it s close enough some are concerned with the switches i am running it in an fx loop pedal so it rarely gets the button pushed anymore i have the joyo ultimate od also nice pedal i think i like this little company i m certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings i got these for my husband the aficionado guitar player in the family he said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product so they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past highly recommended
899	the vt vintage tube monster has quite quickly become my go to overdrive pedal surpassing other od pedals i ve used including the digitech bad monkey the ibanez ts tubescreamer the boss sd super overdrive and remarkably the fulltone fulldrive mosfet the vt has several things going for it tweakable eq high mid low which allows you to run a full spectrum from muddy dirty low od sounds even from a single coil to bright screaming lead tones with high mids or highs noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to squeeze the tone for some interesting effects wide range gain that gets dirty around o clock and full on distortion when crankednow for full disclosure sake i did change out the tube to a jj tesla ax but most people who know tubes will tell you that really tubes are often hit or miss simply on account of them being analog heater based elements that s part of the fun of tube based od i have played a vt that had a great sounding overdrive but mine didn t have that sound until i put in a new tube try it out with the stock tube and go to a different tube if you don t like it at least try a new tube before giving up there are two things that i don t like about the vt and i can tell you both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone this pedal got it right with tone after a tube switch the issues are the housing is huge and if you look inside it seems like a waste of space there s a lot of open space with nothing there and while i can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat it s a bit overboard compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss especially given the large enclosure it would make perfect sense to move the knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side that d take little effort and given the independent power of this pedal would be a piece of cake to achieve heck i could probably do it myself but i don t want to ruin the good sound this produces bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything this takes up at least the space of pedals is it worth it to me it is i run od pedals on my row board and i can honestly say in the last gigs i have never gone to the other od it s been the vintage tube monster every time the tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode the screen could be a little brighter otherwise no complaints brilliant solution to the strap button problem the pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won t slip off works as well as locking strap buttons did for me everything i wanted and more i love the joyo pedals they are amazing and they don t break the bank awesome i didnt have any issue with this when i went to put it in my strat build not a lot to say about it really its metal and it works switchcraft is usually a good product
900	i ve used these strings for longer than i d care to admit string sound is a personal thing these work better for me than any others i ve tried to my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum the five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste others may prefer a different sound i have a korg tuner but found that i needed this so it would not pick up sounds in the room and interfere while i was tuning my dulcimer now i just plug this into the tuner and thenclip it onto the headstock of my dulcimer now i can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise this is a review for themahalo u pk painted economy soprano ukulele pink for the price shipped it can t be beat free shipping via amazon prime i got it for my yo daughter for christmas and she loves it i taught her the c chord and i play the g chord so we play the moldy peaches anyone else but you it s a great little starter musical instrument and a great beater uke that i don t mind getting a bit banged up i was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight well good enough for a cheap uke the strings are some kind of cheap nylon i changed the strings to nylguts and they sound x better almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano almost the fretboard is painted black so i don t know what kind of wood was used i didn t expect ebony for this price i also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high and now even i can play it without complaining too much it has geared tuners not friction pegs it even comes with a matching polyester gig bag now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter overall a decent play starter uke and worth the if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller at first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings but these do work extremely well they seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner post i do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that they re spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed that does make storing them a little akward but again i think this is the best product out there if you change your own strings ps if you are using scissors to clip strings ends you are crazy buy these things oh quick note this capo is meant for instruments with radiused not flat necks that said it works fine on a non radiused ukulele i ve been using only kyser capos for many years now they don t fall off they don t usually pull strings sharp but they do grip tight and can damage some finishes this capo is easy on easy off with the pistol grip has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won t damage finishes and has adjustable tension i backed off the tension as much as possible set it on the neck made one adjustment and it was perfect since i can adjust the tension i have no worries about it pulling strings sharp i only wish it was a bit shorter for ukulele neck widths i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo
901	the dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required comes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple i agree with other reviews that boss exploits its customers by insisting the pedal have the psa supply but sells it separately it s a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it i used a onespot power supply i had already and it works fine just glad i didn t have to shell out more to boss for something they should have provided with the me the first thing i noticed is that the tuner is not too good you get a letter with an arrow on each side and it s not very responsive the korg style dial in reverb controls are easy but extremely limited expected better you get either room or hall neither are that realistic going from manual patch level to bank level is awkward it may just take practice next thing i noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected if i set the e level delayed signal level or balance at around thirty it can be clearly heard when overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected but the delayed signal remains at the original volume effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudible did boss just start making multi effects pedals have they learned nothing despite somewhat mediocre performance and design the me does have features that recommend it some of the drives are usable the controls are accessible and easy to adjust the solo setting on the comp fx module is a nice booster although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the od ds module maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boost the next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches i was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting but all it does is turn the preamp on and off or step one way through the presents fs u it almost appears that boss very cynically crippled the me so it did not threaten gt sales i m looking forward to learning more about this pedal so far it does some good things but it could be much better has anyone else noticed the me reviews out there aren t too useful i m thinking of checking out the vox tonelab ex which is being blown out now at gc for example update despite the limitations above i like the portability of this unit it runs on aa s i think which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play for example at a jam where you don t have power nearby new fail update the tremolo in this unit just stinks i mean stinks whatever the waveform is it s not a sine wave not smooth at all very poor musical characterists whatever engineer was in charge of this you screwed up big time your own boss tremolo pedals are much better than what you ve put in the me why would you do that boss i like tremolo but it s virtually useless in this unit some people won t notice but if you like that swampy fender style tremolo you will be very disappointed i wasn t sure what to expect and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down especially when i took it from the plastic very strong fumes not too pleasant but they dissipated in the basement overnight because of the fumes i was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish i was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours i wouldn t leave it on anything finished for longer than that because this type of foam doesn t last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove for now it s great it comes with a black nylon sort of mesh tube shaped bag good for putting it away or traveling for now i will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn t curl so much for the size and utility the price which goes up and down seems reasonable
902	great sound works just like a phaser should i have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds i use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect cool pedal solid construction only thing is that it is big one other thing it works better if you put it in front i found that in the effects loop it does not work so great one spot has become the standard it is not cheap but it is well made and useful with this you get the power adapter the extension cable to hook up multiple stomp boxes and a bag full of converter cables the power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet so far i have used it successfully only to power two pedals so i cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board but i am sure it would do so without issue as i have seen other do it without a complaint basic delay i found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal the other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically made my tone thin and tinny
903	they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so i have played guitar for most of years and have used about any type of plectrum made i have used coins and washers at times my favorite pick for years was a fender heavy and then i went for the really heavy brands like dunlop or clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone i went back to fenders and then found i like the medium best fender makes these in the coolest colors now so i went with them price them at a store and you will come back here these came from go dps which is no big deal as i shop on amz enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time however i ordered a lot of stuff the day i ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house days later these didn t show up so i contacted amz which goes back to go dps it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing picks it didn t kill me not to have them i have a million picks i just wanted to see these in my hand that said i will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors great price great picks i have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter most stages in bars clubs and restaurants are small enough to use mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake but not all these gls audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the months that i have been using them on an almost daily basis i have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon love this thing it sounds awesome and is built like a tank it sound as good as to monitors and the music stand mounting is clever does everything i want in a personal stage monitor
904	the mm pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks and the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing i know people use yogurt containers credit cards bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks but for me the consistency of the dunlop pick can t be beaten and the price is right too i swear by these strings these are the only strings i will use on my les paul their bright tone sounds great and full while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze don t buy these strings just because i like them buy them because they suit you because you like the tone they provide because they feel good against your fingers cons what cons try them i wasn t expecting much for the price but have to admit i m very pleased with the tone these strings produce straight out of the package after several hours of play and tunings they re spot on and sound sweet as cream butter great product and very highly recommend i thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret
905	nice sturdy construction for the most part although i don t like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends but for the price you get what you pay for i would have much better liked it if they were metal i put this on my les paul and it fit good but i decided it was not the look i wanted on that guitar so i put it on my bc rich instead the bc rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar so when i adjusted the length to a comfortable position the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back i ll give it a try for a while but i think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare strung these up on a seagull guitar to replace some strings that were several years old and the gauge and action of the guitar killed my fingers so it didn t get played much these strings feel great and sound fantastic very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows i have a solid non weight relief les paul traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me like these better then the bulkier dunlops first the goods sturdy leather construction just cant be beat the color is spot on with the pictures shown the bads it s a bit short i have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the shoe lace around the head stock method i had to max this strap out to make the span i m a bigger guy so a smaller person shouldn t have this problem then there s the whole friction of suede on clothing thing i hadn t considered it drags and pulls your shirt really bad making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang that problem is not specific to this strap but the material its made out of it s high quality but i didn t consider it trying to pull my shirt off if had to do over again i d pass
906	i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy keeps things in place one problem the coating will wear out in a short time a few months and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside this might make it a bit hmm i don t want to say hard to lock but you d better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure mine has un clipped a couple times because i didn t check our climate is humid so it s rust friendly which could contribute to why i m having issues however once clipped properly you shouldn t have issues great buy this works very good on a silver flute it s soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it would purchase again what can i say that has not been said about the other drs that i have used they rock roll andbend with the greatest of ease once broken in of course if you want a mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues i decided to use s on my fender tele hollow body because the company puts s on their guitars i didn t want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so i stuckwith the s hey the rev uses s size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone the other reason for the pure nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from p pick ups pure nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit one more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets which is a good thing steel will wear down your frets a lot faster i will say that my very first set of dr pure blues went bad after a few weeks the windings brokeon the d string at two places where the string fretted the reason i kept going back to dr bluesis that i have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars solid bodies another hollow body since then giving dr a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in was a fluke if you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with dr pure blues allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone this is because prior to the mid smost strings were made of nickel during wwii nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings or so the historical theory goes gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound to achieve the vintage tone i am sure you would alsoneed the right amp and the right touch to get to that point i am not necessarily looking for a vintage tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last your exact mileagemay differ i have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers the only time i get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board there is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much i wipethe fret board definitely not the strings though i have also never heard any string squeak from thestrings that would give me pause either any string even on acoustic will squeak occasionally withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high or the nut is not cut right or the wrong sizestring is used for the nut well there you go what i have experienced with dr pure blues nickel wrap round core strings i willalso say that on guitar forums that i frequent more people are giving dr kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings so if you do get a bum string give them a holler now get out thereand play your heart out oh and how about working on that vintage tone while you are at it have fun good strings they work and sound good i didn t notice much of a difference between these and run of the mill d addario strings this polish works well for what i need it for i am not a clean freak but i take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there that s not to brag but to illustrate my experience with amps everything you can imagine this amp ranks up there with the best of them i m surprised as i ve hated with a passion every dsp solid state amp i ve ever played this hybrid is incredible the effects are excellent the built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording it has many onboard effects but i have racks and pedals that outdo those so i don t use them for recording it s not a band amp unless you re an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums it s watts but it s loud it s just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums though you might be fine for overdrive depending on the venue and situation it s not going to emulate certain amps like a vox very well but it does excellent with a fender black face excluding the tube reverb it does a bassman ok but doesn t quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original bassman doesn t cost dollars other it does a marshall pretty well marshall s based on bassman without the delicate touch so there s no wonder the acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full yet doesn t sound like a filter and are amazing voices you can bypass that and use it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original super champ i also have a x vintage box i connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound when i m just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don t wanna have to dial in sounds with my vox ac or fender deluxe reverb then this my amp of choice it is miles ahead of a fender blues deluxe yes this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp i ve played outside of a mesa boogie buy it in fact buy two this is a future classic this fender treated polish cloth a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is asimple product the classic fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth the resealableplastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read fenpc and states it s size as being inchesby inches well its size as i measured it is actually inches by inches just wanted to mention itbecause i have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this me no problem the missing of an inch is a minor detail go to a lumber yard some time and look for x s now you won tactually find any actual x s they ve been shrinking for over years i am not sure what this cloth is treated with but it does not feel any different than the un treatedgibson polishing cloths i have purchased i also gave it the nose test i thought there might be a hintof or a whiff of some polish or something nope no scent no whiff what i did find disconcerting is the warning in product details section on the amazon web page it isthe fourth bullet down california residents click here for proposition warning below is thewarning verbatim from amazon kudos to amazon for posting this warning california s proposition entitles california consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels we care about our customers safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions we are providing the following warning for products linked to this page warning this product contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm just thought i let you know about that one i guess the missing s of an inch is really no big deal atthis point you just need to worry that in your concerns for keeping your beautiful guitar sparkling clean you could get cancer wow back to the review the fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the gibson cloths but not much differencebetween the two well the gibson cloth does have a whip stitch edging around it other than that notmuch difference when i use the fender cloth on my fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left i like tokeep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that idon t use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as theneck so based on the fact that fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar i will give thisamazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth stars it appears to do what it supposed to do and that is polish your guitar without harming it it gets one less star because of the california prop warning i suppose i need to take this a somewhatseriously so i docked it one star i will definitely be washing my hand right after using it so far no harm has been done to any guitars in the writing of this review for the future i am not so sureabout me thank you and say goodnight gracie note about vendor go dps responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time it was dayspast the delivery date i e mailed them they responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail tome that came in an appropriate amount of time for such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service i will use them again in the future i ve used this for about months now no malfunctions looks good works fine no complaints what more can i say
907	these replaced the stock tuners on my squier deluxe stratocaster and were not a drop in fit there are two pegs on the tuners that didn t line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes i was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away these make string changes so easy and i love the ratio of these tuners because they are staggered i was able to ditch the string trees as well just recently a few months back got my first tube amp wanted a good analog delay pedal to go with it i found that the digital delay pedals left something to be desired at least for my ears after a lot of research and reading reviews i decided to give this pedal a try all i can say is wow it has excellent sound quality very low noise while off it is transparent in your petal chain the settings are outstanding you will not be disappointed very well made purchased it to use on a slotted headstock martin and it just didn t fit well for me also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove a string style worked a lot better was a lot easier to attach and remove and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed great price and quality it is nice to not have to connect two pedals inches away with a cable this compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop it doesn t take a lot of space on my pedal board and it s simple to use i ve used the boss rc and the digitech stereo jam man although the others have more features i like this little pedal it took a little time to get use to the one button operation but i find this to be very reliable i ve owned mine since the day they came out and i have had no issues
908	these work much better than standard stamped trees no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly i did notice in guitar center some of those spendy american strats have the cheap stamped out trees and non locking tuners they work no issues handy to have on hand dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place they work and are fender parts even thoigh they work on many brands use them on all makes and no complaints todate
909	this is what it is a super cheap mono cable it should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded etc for the price and intent i almost gave it stars but it s not a star cable it s a fair quality ultra cheap cable stars seems about right yes this is almost exactly what i wrote about the other hosa cable i reviewed i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product a work around for the main issue follows the review the flaws that bother me in order of significance are quality very weak soft metal screws using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw heads on all that i worked with of them rounded out so much that i was afraid they would be hard to remove later causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws engineering the instructions recommend and the screws the ones that come with the straplocks are designed for a phillips screwdriver however a standard driver is too big to fit into the strap buttons so you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit or using a which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job engineering the point of connection for the strap is th of an inch out from the guitar the strap button has a radius about ths of an inch therefore any lateral stress i e weight of the guitar is magnified by more than x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw a pound guitar would be applying a constant to pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher realistically if the screws weren t total crap this might have been a or star review once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won t fit and get the things properly installed it would probably work out for most people so if you are stuck with a set here s what i recommend go to a hardware store and buy x oval head stainless steel replacement screws note that these won t fit properly but they are the closest match and can be modified they are cents each at my local stores and would have cost dunlop maybe cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this put the screw into an electric drill pointy end in so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head it doesn t need much i used a belt sander and it took about seconds each while you are at it file down a cheap screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button install with the new screws as normal and recommend that your friends try a different brand the thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference for my style the dunlop tortex is perfect the surface is matte and not too slick i don t think i have ever worn one down to being unusable they seem to last forever or until they re lost i ve tried other brands and picks made of other materials but i always come back to these i ll probably be buried with one in my hand i read the reviews of the few similar options i went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean not much of that complaint here but this definitely has that problem my guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes so this can t go in several out of the way places i had hoped would work also i was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact guitar rack however the angle makes that very awkward i hope to modify it to work but i m not super hopeful at this point will probably have to manufacture something to replace it the one i got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw i feel like if i tighten it too much i could dent my mic stand tube but i haven t dented anything yet so perhaps i m just too skeptical in any event it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction but everything works it s getting the job done and i haven t seen a better option all in all a pretty good device i bought this strap for my luna string the strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what i needed if you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp drop one of these in the v position the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier easy to do and you ll notice an immediate increase in distortion placed one in a fender blues junior before when the master was down and the pre amp volume was all the way up i could barely get some overdrive afterwards it had plenty night and day difference good sound too not harsh adds harmonics very lush sounding tung sol knows how to do it i ve bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet they all work flawlessly i ll definitely buy more and highly recommend them just like schaller but fender branded and cheaper asian made this is the second clip on tuner i have bought this is much better than the other brand i have it s easy to use and see the colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite the built in tap metronome is a cool idea if you re shopping for a tuner give this a try at less than it s a fantastic buy having to send the first snark sn back but the replacement thus far has been flawless i made a slight adjustment to my guitar s truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on a couple tips to tuning a guitar tune it like you play it if you strum play softly then pluck tune each string softly however most people don t play softly so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes they pluck each string and wait like seconds till the ringing fades out so they are generally tuning each string as it begins softly resonating so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat to tune your guitar correctly you really ought to pluck each string hard like every seconds and tune it that way rather than waiting for the sound to fade out if you do it this way you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you re strumming the living daylight out of it also please check your intonation your th frets should be in tune same as your open strings you pluck your open string hard tune as described above then you check intonation by pressing very lightly with just the tip of your finger and don t touch any other part of the neck on the same string but th fret and both should be in tune the exact same if they are off th open then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment please don t pay someone to setup your guitar you can do it yourself so easily go on u toob and search scott grove tuning your guitar wrong and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over guitars he spends almost an hour explaining all the details also watch his video on how to setup adjust intonation truss rod action etc btw if you can t get your snark to tune your guitar hint it s not the tuner s fault the first saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down then your next strings d a e should also look like another staircase going down if not break out your philips head tweak your intonation
910	i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality thank u guys i m very happy with this pedal it seems to be a knock off of the mxr phase pedal being that it provides a nice classic subtle phase effect you can flip the switch to swirl for a more pronounced effect but i love just keeping it mild the metal switch button to engage the pedal doesn t have the click that many pedals do i actually prefer this the click effects wear out sooner some of my high end pedals also use this smooth click less way of engaging a pedal you ll know it s on by the tone change and the bright led light imho you don t need a click switch the sounds are clean and smooth clear and bright and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effect quality and value all the way great little pedal has a nice set of adjustments to give a wide range of delays and echo to your sound easy to use very low price classic sounds i wish i had ears so i could buy another one strictly home studio use haven t tried gigging with it though it seems pretty sturdy it is plastic but pretty solid plastic i also have a danelectro fab echo and this just blows it away the danelectro is okay but it just doesn t have the depth or adjustment that the berhinger pedal has the product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the job it was intended for service was more than expected
911	price very reasonable price for what they do comfort these stay on your head very well and are comfortable i have not noticed ear irritation yet noise reduction these are absolutely stellar at noise reduction these block so much sound you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums they also don t distort out side sound some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly sound quality crisp mid and high range when it comes to the low end these are lacking and if you blast your music the low end distorts but they block sound so well you don t have to blast them why not just buy in ear head phones and over ear muffs i have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones it is very annoying doesn t work very well and looks pretty dumb too these head phones are a much better solution this is a great guitar for the money i paid for my guitar and bought it through amazon com from streamline audio video it arrived ahead of schedule in great shape ready to play right out of the box after tuning it of course if you want a better guitar than this you will need to spend a whole lot more the sound is great and it is easy to play only about long and may weigh a bit over the lbs stated in the description my strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what i will need it has been a while since i put new strings on my acoustic guitar these went on with no problems they have a brassy sound to them since purchasing them they still ring nicely i have been using them for about months i play about twice a week and they have maintained a good sound over the past months not too difficult to tune either
912	i just got this pedal so i don t know how it will hold up over a long period of time but on first play it pleasantly surprized me it does give you some of the way out sounds other pedals my give but it does provide a gradual increase in phase as you turn the one knob mine came with a volt in it but you can also use a adapter useful tones at dollar store price good deal thick harmonically rich articulate overdrive amazing sustain booming bass even mids chrystal highs the pedal responds well to the guitar s volume and easily replaces my holy fire custom badass od and every other od i have how this pedal is so cheap is beyond me just buy it i ve had this for almost a year while i m no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes i haven t used a compressor pedal since washburn made that really janky noisy compressor pedal in the late s i have never used a ross so the fact that this is supposedly a clone didn t have any influence over my decision to buy the joyo i will say that it s not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it sure i love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do but compression takes time to dial in even if you are familiar with it that said i finally love this pedal and feel that i can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrive distortion i bought it mainly because i play in a rush cover band and the harmonics at the beginning and end of red barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until i got the joyo dialed in compression isn t the easiest effect to dial in but once you re there you can pretty much leave it set as long as you re using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars great pedal once you get it dialed in take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as i am
913	you need nothing else to replace your string no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar or both i have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you like me don t like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache recomended i use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars except for the smaller takamine new yorker and a l ami i use the d addario custom lights i have grown a fondness for the phosphor bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking also the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys i ve tried such as martins and elixirs these strings are quite durable and long lasting in the years i ve been playing i ve never had these strings break on me i ve broken martin and elixir strings in the past the color coded end balls help with the restringing i typically get the three pack so i can restring a trio set of my herd at a time i really can t complain about anything the individual gauges are w w w whighly recommended i use this for a bass and while i cannot get deep tones it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends tip it sounds better if you don t cramp it all the way up stop at i was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this but its a nice cable no noise or hum whatsoever great gig bag for acoustic guitar very well made with good padding it has six nice pockets a rubber bumper and two straps it fits the guitar nicely i would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag the strap and picks were an added bonus a great value
914	quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much i purchased a classical guitar and only had a traditional steel string capo available to me not thinking it through i used it on my nylon stings and after a few times i realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced along with my string order i added this capo so it does not happen again pros it s small and lightweight it s very well made it not only looks great but also appear to be of high quality it s very adjustable unlike my steel string capo this uses a screw knob to tighten not spring loaded this allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings it works on steel strings yep i found my self needing a capo on another guitar and only having this with me i saw no reason it should not work so i gave it a try and it performed wonderfully i won t be using it full time on my steel strings but great to know in a pinch i have use it if you need a great capo thats gentle on your nylon strings then this is the one to get low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming for the price it is a good deal
915	everyone has there opinions i was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of john what i can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days they slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time sound really nice on my taylor ce i m going back to what works best for me martin sp custom light while the packaging sealed for each set is a good thing and also the individual color coding of each string i do prefer martins i bought the capo for the guys at a correctional facility that i work for it gets abused so i don t look for it to last long would not buy it for my own guitar
916	although the cloth i got was black and not yellow just pointing that out it works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror i can see my reflection perfectly clear i usually play classical nylon string guitar but have an ovation deep bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out i never have found strings that i really liked don t ask me why i never thought about contacting ovation and asking them what they use from the factory one of those duh things i didn t even think of until just now based on reviews and questions answered here on amazon i purchased this triple set of strings instant gratification first they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days but these retained tune fairly well the sound is excellent the playability comfy the tone of my ovation was back here are my itemized observations first three sets for currently cannot beat the value for price brilliance what many people call bright brilliance is the opposite of dull some strings sound dull right out of the package these strings are brilliant bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar tone the natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through no hint of tinniness plunk or twang mellow mellow is difficult to define but the best definition i ve heard is ah that sounds nice mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar it s a pleasantness that doesn t grate on your ears when you pluck a string these strings are medium mellow just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep balance at first the e overtoned the b and e but as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out the trebles became clearly audible while the e and a provided just the right touch of bass comfort the mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action these strings are just right especially the mm e which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming summary these are excellent strings which doesn t surprise me since i ve use d addario classical guitar strings for years martin and ghs are both good strings but somehow d addario just shines thanks to amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try highly recommended great idea well made nice heavy webbingfit probly or more picks no need to glue screw junk on your axe maybe good with slide or capo haven t tried but good product and price this cuts strings with no problems it doesn t take a lot of pressure to squeeze the handles and it doesn t damage the cutting blades like some wire cutters highly recommended for frequent string changes i bought five of these when they were being blown out for like apiece but even at the normal price they are a bargain they are comfortable when used for an extended period of time even with a heavy les paul if you play an sg these will help counter the dreaded neck dive that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars incidentally amazon is selling these straps at about the price you would pay at gc highly recommended this thing is a tank i don t think you could break this beast if you wanted to the last string winder you will ever buy i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together the glue didn t hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund warehouse deals are not such good deals easy to use and the clip is sturdy a bit slow compared to the snarks i own but i like it i love the snark tuners but don t know that i d call it super tight or faster than the older sn i feel the display is an improvement easy on the eyes hopefully more reliable than sn i ve had pixels dropping out on one sn that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine too soon to tell if the sn will hang in there i don t see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an sg don t know why as it works fine with acoustics and strat response time on the sg is longer than the older sn model but i haven t yet tried to understand what s going on with it have t tried it on bass yet but i know that the sn didn t play well with the e string open no big deal i just tune it at th fret could choose any note since it s chromatic speaking of which playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the snark tune any string to match the song and then tune the other strings with the same displayed error bottom line is that it s a great tuner and it s not likely that i ll get much use out of the old korg tuner that once balanced on my knee
917	nice holds picks better then my old one and best of all it comes with one free disintegrating pick it is really awesome all you have to do is alt pick in th and watch it dissapear before your very eyes lol great product though i ve never bought strings before so it is kind of hard for me to rate these so far so good i ordered this bench for last christmas i m satisfied so far good value for money the seat is generously padded and is inches thick padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion all steel frame construction feels sturdy contrary to one of the reviews my bench came with height adjustment it is not on the fly kind of thing though each of the legs has holes low middle high a fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs and the bolt becomes the crossing point of x three positions roughly correspond to and inches for changing height all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it don t worry you don t need any tool to do the job thanks to a large plastic knob see the picture and you ll understand how it works mine initially came with middle position i also tried high and low but set it back to middle it seems to be a good compromise for my family as the bench is used daily by me my wife and my kids sure it s nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily however with this price i wouldn t complain at all this works well with the mandolin it is certainly an easy change i would recommend it or purchase again
918	i have a collection of straps but not a black one this one matches the acoustic electric i bought perfectly the pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have i would buy fromthis company again thank you there are better tuners out there far better this could be good but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there and they don t even tune it well to standard especially when tuning the g string i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open tunings on an acoustic this piece of junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using f or c notes i have no clue as to why that is pretty stupid if you ask me especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d bags i say that with love that play in open tunings trust me your money is best spent elsewhere this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain good quality plastic and attractive and cheap replacement for any acoustic guitar slotted with taper and fits well in my bridges
919	good quality cable and sounds very good i ve been using finger ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars it has multiple uses cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands extending the life and tone of your strings lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints etc from the top sides and back will not harm most finishes as far as i know i usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well i did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference i m not sure if this is true as i ve never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers however i typically try to keep it off of electronic components in general just out of common sense for under ten bucks the can will last you awhile just order a few at a time and find free shipping you ll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time i love this product i t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast so y don t have to life it over your head well worth the price i bought a couple to replace some of my old rusty chrome stands and was skeptical at first i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical have bought several more i would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician they use a heavy metal casing that appears durable and the cord is decent enough for live sound but a very slight hum was present with my guitar harp amp i would pay this price for just the element it is truly a great buy and i would use it for armature work any day i use it for harp harmonica and it works great and it sounds smooth with vocals too i would recommend it to any friend and i already have worth every penny i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews i have five guitars including two les paul s and they hold them just fine i give them four stars the are fine for i believe all guitars at home but i wouldn t use them for retail or something like a school they are made if abs plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it s just a rivet the holds them together the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke like the other reviewer said you really should find a stud to mount them to but if you must use wall anchors use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall all in all these are sturdy and stable when anchored to a stud and i ll use more if i have the need this is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric i did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close sounds great still suck at bending a buddy of mine got one and he s killing it on the bends we both been playing for about months great harp will buy another if it ever wears out
920	these strings are different and really quite nice the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings i really like them only possible difficulty is that high e etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string i have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my epiphone as well the standard earnie balls i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners and what a difference i had to drill some holes in my headstock but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them the locking mechanism is great it acts like a vice in a woodshop project and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down tune them use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings retune a couple more times and they just don t go out of tune anymore regardless of how many times i bend the strings these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune wow this little amp packs tons of tone sound hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully the clean channels are really clean the dirty channels are just plain nasty watts is enough power to blow your socks off lots of bang for the buck here i own a number of guitar hangers this one was a good buy for the money i have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive but also a good deal pricier for what i spent for this one it is adequate as long as it holds up pun intended
921	great replacement string for your ukulele great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku these things muffle sound great they have good sound quality perfect for recording loud drums perfect for drowning out people that guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost it is a great pleasure to jam on it around sound is like it s real big brother very very familiar i suppose it is the best choise for your kid all hardware is ok just give some days to tuners to get used to like the previous reviewer i bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp and it just did wonders to warm the sound only problem is now i am eyeing my amp all it s tubes and thinking if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre amp imagine what some of these will do in my fender sigh always something anyway this is great i am sure i will get more for the money this one s a no brainer it s a one trick pony but that s what it s supposed to be and it does its trick very well sounds better than the ibanez or boss models warmer and less processed sounding plugged into a solid state amp at its lowest drive setting it sounds like you re playing clean through a tube amp plugged into my twin reverb not a re issue but the real thing wow i just got it a couple of weeks ago but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem don t be a gear snob who looks down on lesser expensive products the sound is what matters this is my first guitar tuner i don t have expiriance to determine do this tuner is better then other tuners is working very good satisfaction my first elec guitar i m years old and this guitar is perfect if theirs better ones out there then i can t wait to get one i ve got this one on a small watt amp that s not a name brandamp and it sounds very good so needless to say i m verrrrrrry happy and love the blues and jazz sounds i m getting b t w who said learning the guitar was difficult piece of cake if u practice buy this guitar u won t be sorry you did enjoyjawbone
922	i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk and the item pictured is nylon i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip i m happy with this used it to replace the blown speaker from a yr old w roland cube amp a bass player used the amp and i think it was too much for the speaker next time i ll use the pa for the bass player much better sound perfect fit etc keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey type sound i believe it has those using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp i had some issues with my watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes issues not only continued but worsened hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes i eventually put back the original el s and that didn t help once i removed the tung sol ax preamp tubes and replaced the hum stopped sound quality of the amp was consistent quiet and back to par my experience with the tung sol tubes was very very negative they caused me to go out and buy another amp i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast i ll never buy this brand again
923	these cables are awesome they do what they are suppose to do and do it well i personally like that they are smaller in the middle and are easier to fold than regular cable if you are looking to connect your pedals and dont want to break your wallet look no farther than hosa inch cable this is a great sounding reverb pedal tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound i ve combined this with a epiphone sheraton ii semi hollow body and have been able to get some awesome deep rich sounds watch out for feedback though the design is very solid and the controls are quite easy to use honestly i think it has a lot of reverb settings that i won t use very much but there s no problem with them being there i definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of kings of leon u etc or if you re just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones this is it this has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar my only caveat to this review is that i haven t tried out other reverb pedals but this one definitely suits all my needs arrived on time works as intended and maybe more one day i was pondering how best to de clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various v v dc equipment on my table or rack fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant my problem was solved i chose the v adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary v dc source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack i also bought another similar unit form another source here on amazon and used that to supply the v dc source to power the rest of the units that needed a v source everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage been working without a problem to this day nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy peppy perky free i do i do i do this tuner is awesome and accurate very noticeable and what else can i say for the price best deal ever get it ps i use it for my base though satisfied thanks korg
924	i have been playing for years have owned many different guitars and amps tube and solid state currently own and use marshall jcm dsl w b cabmarshall mg half stackfender super champ x w carvin cabfender frontman rline spider iii watt x kustom watt combo x out of my solid state amps this one sounds the best in fact this amp sounds great gets plenty loud is affordable and is not some junk brand you have never heard of has a great clean tone with a lot of low end reverb sounds great as well a little overdrive sounds good too unless you use too much gets quite noisy and loses its clarity remember this amp is not for metal if high gain is what your after then stay away if you are into any other kind of music then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price also unless your playing with a drumset this amp is overkill as far as volume goes watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist if you are into any other kind of music then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price all in all this amp was a good buy and i recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range but this wouldn t be a very good review without having some cons so here are mine these are by no means deal breakers but i find them quite annoying power switch is on the back i find it annoying to have to reach around the back of the amp and feel for the power switch every time i turn it on it is especially annoying if you are like me and have limited space and stack your amps on top of each other with another amp sitting on top of my frontman r the power switch is even harder to get to effects loop is on the front the last thing i want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere when using the effects loop one has to deal with looking at two more wires hanging down over the front of your amp when they could be hidden in the back not the end of the world but i just don t understand why why fender why foot switch jack is on the front this one is not so bad but just adds more messy wires to the picture reverb is not foot switchable foot switch includes channel and boost buttons a third button for reverb would have been amazing cab is made of super cheap particle board not that i expected anything different in this price range but the wood used is so soft that you cannot pick it up by the back i could easily break a piece off with my bare hand if i wanted to no exaggeration i know because when i first got this amp i went to pick it up and i immediately stopped myself because i could feel it about to break bottom line buy if this is the best amp you can afford this matches the sound your after you need the watts to be loud enough for a drumset you want the fender name and sound without the huge price tag dont buy if you play metal hard rock this is your first amp you only plan on playing at bedroom levels you can afford a tube amp this strap is pretty thin not like some of the other for the same price that i have purchased on amazon still does its job but we ll see how the quality is after a while
925	i love it im using this mic to record my vocals for my home made demos it works just awesome quality and price im just satisfied this is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand it is very well made and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing playing with an instument or just singing only thing make sure you read the description well it is a euro stand so it has threads it does not come with a mic clip when i ordered my mic from behringer their clip had standard threads which obviously would not attach i ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some now if the manufacture would just provide a clip they would have the best stand deal going overall i would buy again i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive lighter than a full boom i had purchased this cord and a cord for an assignment i was going on i had previously bought a shorter cord that just didn t fit tight enough into the mic this one and the other one i bought were really a great well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should i would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon its working great but it does not work in stereo it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive i own a native instruments maschine mikro but find myself using this even more often you can program it to whatever midi values you want the pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive
926	this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price hi guys really simple little review here this is a windscreen it does windscreen things pros it works it fits my microphonecons the package game a little smushed so it s a little misshapen it s it works if it s not the highest quality stop complaining it s what did you expect kevlar this is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word i have many microphones and this compares to the range mics purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home the cable is great because it s long enough to allow us to move our mic where we need it i got this item much quicker than i expected the shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition seller is a in my book if we need more of this type of equipment would certainly buy from them again
927	this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra great buy i now have two of these really wish now i had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase kicks self and all i can say you simply can t beat it i also have a hercules tri stand x more expensive than this one and between the two gotta admit the only major advantage my tri stand has is saving space which actually is a huge consideration for me i honestly don t know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two musician s gear tubular guitar stands i currently own never once have given me an issue aside from bodily running into the thing and they have held do hold a variety guitars of various styles banjos both open back and bg resonator mandolas anything with a long neck all in all unless there is some specialized stand need i would first come to musician s gear these picks were a good deal they are pretty cool looking and i will be able to use them for a long time they are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned the thumbpicks both came in medium which at the time i didn t pay any attention to however after about weeks of using them and the fingerpicks on my banjo i came to the conclusion that i needed a large size for my thumb the mediums sat a little too high up my thumbnail for comfort i suppose you could put them in hot water to stretch them out as i have read but regardless for a quick n dirty set for someone just starting out its just the ticket without having to buy a bunch of sets of to figure out what is comfortable with price assortment in mind i give stars i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well yes there many banjos and some with more frills there is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely i see no flaws on my banjo i did not have the problem with the th string machine being to tight as others i bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was bucks cheaper with free shipping if i could give it more than stars i would i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either a keeper for sure i bought this as a second tuner for gigs it is awesome easy to use easy to see simple inexpensive get one you will not be disappointed
928	this is a great effect awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable eq is very sensitive and delivers as it should i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended i have a lot of pedals including many delays and echos the mxr is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my aqua puss eh delux memory boy ibanez boss and lets not even get into the behringer stuff i like the chorus like mod button very lush and sweet to listen too not as feature rich as some of my other delays but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me simple to use compact and well built i like using this clean but even it s ability to take some distortion is pretty good this is simliar to my favorite echo the morely ecv from the s in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it lush is the right word hope this helps i don t really care for the fx loop on my fender supersonic head as i started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the mxr pedals so when this came out last year i snatched one up and started experimenting with it i love it bypassed i still get that in your face strait into an amp sound but ingage it with my delays and phase s and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss very cool and of course it is an mxr so it is built like a tank if you are looking to spend not too much on a distortion pedal in my opinion this is the one to get there are a few more different models and brands that are good but i could use this pedal no matter what style of music i m playing and not feel like i have to sell it if i start a new project replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and i m glad i did this is one lush pedal and it s all analog this pedal also sounds great with gain
929	it sounds great nice and warm and lush one of the better trems i ve had the pleasure to use however i hate the plastic housing and how the input output jacks are located i don t have heavy feet so it will probably last a good long while on my board but i really wouldn t want to put too much weight on it it does what it says it does only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled times a week i was pretty happy with them when i got them and finally used them and will likely pick up more once i need them i have had this pedal for a while and prefer it to my boss dd and the anolog is much more natural sounding its said that its not actually an anolog pedal however i think it does a good job at mimicking anolog sound ive played guitar and bass for over years and had a few decent pedals in that time i might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound great pedal so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one what i can say with over years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low price i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion see my other reviews on these pedals basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween it is built solidly and looks roadworthy it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great is it of the same caliber as a boutique pedal no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price i would have no issue gigging with this unit the distortion is warm with the tone at with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available lots of sounds in this unit and very very quiet nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned for classic rock this is perfect maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatoverall no concerns with this great product good for the price but if you can spend a few dollars more i would recommend the graph tech ones
930	my picks fall out way too easy while i m playing live best inexpensive right angle cables out there i use these in my lesson room at the music store that i teach at they will last forever if you take care of them i got an ernie ball strap instead of a planet waves strap these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles i bought a set of s and s and i also have some d addario s the s are super slinky just like the name says they re great for quick movement around the fret board my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding i play a lot of rock and sometimes these just don t pack a punch like the s or s do all in all though these are great strings and i will definitely continue to buy ernie ball i ll probably opt for s or s though my son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks he says it s easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder highly recommend i use it as a practice mic it s fine if no one hears you but if your gonna use it live just suck it up and buy a shure sm but if you just need something you can ware out and not care this will do fine i bought a couple of these two years ago they are a sturdy but lightweight stand the small footprint is nice for those with limited space i use for both electric and acoustic guitars i will say that the two i recently purchased are not the same as the ones purchased in the pictured product is the same but the actual product is not the newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model the tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support the body support now inserts through the base tube the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece the rubber feet are also smaller these changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable however i believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars i didn t notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported there may be a concern about damage to certain finish i would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material an amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar months and no problems yet
931	works great for changing guitar strings good build and doesn t look cheap built in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus i ve bought of these over the past couple of years i wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that i could use one handed it gives me piece of mind that somone won t just brush up against a guitar and damage it i ve noticed that it has been backordered on several sites so i expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too been using these for years i like the regular slinkies too but it seems these tend to last longer or it could just be in my head either way i am happy with them this mike is a great way to start recording at home i use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball i know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price however i find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home screws are starting to wear out after about months of use the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear to be expected but i m sure you ll appreciate hearing that this is not one of those miracle deals where you get something amazing for the money it is what it is and not much more i finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner this thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it doesn t suck any of your tone i haven t used the battery pack so don t know about battery life i use a one spot plug to power it another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on it s very heavy and seems sturdy and well built the display is a little confusing at first but once i read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use love this strap it s a good quality strap and i have three of them being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild just go browse a crafts store and see what you can find to make it yours i can t let on what i ve done to mine because they are originals but you can have a blast making a one of a kind of your own come on we re artists so show off your creativity i have tried other picks like this that had points which wen t as confortable this one is more confortable and has great grip if you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out
932	these dunlop mm picks are the right size not to big or too small been using these for years always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases they never wear out they are not too stiff or too flimsy they work good for the sound on the strings easy to hold on to fits very well on my les paul i haven t used the cable yet but it looks new and durable the cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what i expected can t wait for the rest of my gear to get here so i can do a sound test based on physical condition i would recommend this product i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone i might try a lighter set next time but these have a good clear tone from low to high and are fairly comfortable this unit is well constructed switches and knobs feel sturdy the user guide is informative it has a wide tone range i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear it is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set it doesn t have presets you can loop an effects processor thru it this is a good product the construction is pretty good it will give you a variety of bass tones you have to buy a trs to a ts adaptor to line out to your amp or sound system i like the drum machine and the tuner but i don t like the effects i don t have an electric guitar i only have acoustic electric guitars and i thought that maybe i could make it sound like an electric but the sounds are distorted and not very clean it sound muff for an electric guitar maybe it would work fine but not for an acoustic electric guitar i bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele i am having a hard time using the picks on my uke i guess i don t like the way the uke sounds when using them it sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff but i am sure other people may disagree as far as the quality and vendor delivery i am happy and i have no complaints i use the picks occasionally yes i would recommend them to other uke players i would like to let people know they are very stiff i guess i thought being felt they wouldn t be so stiff but i am new to playing an instrument and i guess i just don t have much knowledge about picks
933	let me start off by saying i have had several types of humidifiers all of which have worked well the major upside to this humidifier is you do not have to worry about over humidifing your guitar packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use one star short of a star review why the price for the replacement packets other than that a wonderful system these picks come in a large range of sizes but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with there is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers but it goes away after a bit they seem to be decent quality the thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly these are ok to have around the house to play with but i would not recommend them for live performance these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too
934	this is a little more expensive than some other brands but i think it sounds great and it s way more durable than a plastic pedal i m pretty new to electric guitar so i m not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers to me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp so i think it s a good purchase these are my favorite picks to play with the dunlop tortex picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic buy this it s cheap and better than fuzz pedals that cost times as much it can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard amazing sounds it works and it works well it easily cuts guitar strings ukulele strings etc no damage to blades when cutting heavy to light gauge steel strings if you change your own strings this cutter is a must have it is very durable the material is made of high quality metal and it makes clean cuts the rubber grips are comfortable to use and have red accents and therefore easy to find my only minor gripe is that it is spring loaded to open i ve cut myself with the blades reaching into the pocket a few times when i first got it thankfully i don t change strings too often i also made a little leather pouch for the clipper end and i put a rubber band around the handles to keep it closed a must have for your guitar bass ukulele bag highly recommended i use it to wind my strings i recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast very easy to use
935	i m really happy with this pedal give a good phase sounds like waylon would use simple to use one knob and it doesn t boost or reduce the signal according to the ad copy this pedal replicates full stack marshall crunch as the other reviewers will testify it does indeed do just that what i m loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up its responsive to your picking attack its distortion is very very harmonically rich and it does give you a marshall type sound good boost in the mids and bass giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for sad to say it actually does the full stack thing better than my proco rat which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal the rat is fantastic and i have no plans to sell mine don t get me wrong but the crunch distortion can get the raging full stack tones the rat can but has a tighter bottom end less noise and a more open sound than the rat individual notes ring out great on the crunch distortion its a great pedal period its a darn guitar miracle at as a side point i play lots of ramones stuff and this pedal more than any other gives me that awesome johnny ramone tone i was running my gold top with p s into this pedal then into the sparkling clean twin reverb setting on my fender mustang ii this pedal plays well with modeling amps which is a rarity let me tell you and with some tweaking i was getting a fantastic ramones tone better than i ve ever got with my rat my boss ds ds hm anything else i ve owned and i ve owned over dozen other dirt boxes over the years this is the pedal that finally did it it just nails that cranked s marshall stack sound my hat s off to joyo they made a fantastic distortion one of the very best i ve ever played and they re practically giving it away buy one you ll use it you ll love it you ll be happy you bought it i m a string rock bass player that has purchased a lot of overdrive and fuzz pedals most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass they typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end don t provide enough dynamics or don t provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive this incredible inexpensive box really nails it you get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking the downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff the frosted side of me loves that i saved a lot of money buying this ripoff i m going this stompbox as i always do based on the quality of the pedal and what it does not necessarily whether than tone is useful for my particular setup viewed in that objective light the joyo jf ac tone is an excellent pedal for to there are two ways to think of the jf and the other tech clones in this line california american british sound etc the first is the obvious one which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain this box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to clone a vox ac amplifier into the speaker how effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self at the end of the day if your amplifier particularly the budget solid state ones has certain limitations that you don t like too bright not loud enough too muddy breaks up too easily no pedal including a boutique one is going to fully overcome those deficiencies but the second way to think of the jf is as a preamp where the output would go directly into a recording device pa system computer or tablet i don t have enough experience trying that though i did a little bit with the joyo california to say how well that works but i ve heard great examples of it online also having the convenience of amp like controls with knobs is certainly very convenient if you like to play record in that manner as for the sound of the pedal it s very good i ve heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up but i wouldn t let that concern you that s true of virtually any distortion overdrive pedal it can be cleaned up with a noise gate suppressor and i think the better use of this pedal is on the low and mid gain settings anyway the drive knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp it s a very nice tone responds well to picking and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume which many pedal distortions do not do the voice knob is hard to describe basically it morphs the tone into something deeper and punchier as you turn it up but that also changes the impact of all your other settings including drive eq and level if i had one complaint about this pedal even compared to the california also a very cool pedal i was a little surprised how much this pedal wants to be dirty it s tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily but again i think part of that is you re basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo check out some of the youtube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder it could be completely different in that context at any rate it s a very intriguing device at only and i could see finding new uses for it in the future i haven t envisioned yet update april i actually sold this pedal instantly regretted it and then bought it back now that i understand how to use it properly by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp through the effects loop i am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal it really is an excellent value either as a foundation pedal or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a pa speaker system i won t be letting the ac tone go this time fit perfect to my taylor t and no cons i can find so far if you want a capo for guitar this one is the one stop shopping for you
936	for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep my kids are all interested in learning the uke this one really appealed to my son because of the front design plays well and keeps in tune as a guitar player i recently march started to play the uke i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument these string play good and stay in tune pretty well i will buy again i have use this tuner for quite a few years its easy to use clip it on and go i just bought of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or mandolin the price was good see ya this electric guitar padded bag is exactly what i wanted the price was right the guitar is secure and wont get scratched the pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig very cost effective great price
937	this thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top i had a lpb that sucked tone and sounded like crap but i really need a line boost and didn t want to spend a lot for one this little baby at about o clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs i like these short planet waves cables for short runs where there won t be a lot of abuse going on they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range this is my first tube amp and after doing a ton of research i found that the vox ac c was just about perfect for me it came down to the ac fender blues jr and the ibanez ts the blues jr has a somewhat small enclosure for a x and i felt it had a bit of a boxy tone otherwise it s a great amp the ibanez has a classic tube screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes but it lacked a reverb circuit which was a deal breaker silly reasoning i know the ac has a larger enclosure than the blues jr and it has a reverb and tremolo circuit so it had the features i was looking for and most importantly it produces some killer tone if you ve ever seen or read a review of this amp chances are you ve heard about the classic vox chime which this amp has but i fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away the normal channel will break up nicely too but i would suggest an a b switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty i was worried at first that watts wouldn t be enough but fear not this amp is loud maybe too loud as i m just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom but that s not a bad thing it totally blows away my watt marshall solid state and i haven t put the volume much past o clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if i do while there is no effects loop it takes pedals well but for distorted tones i ve found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch which i ve come to love so much as stated above the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp or as previously stated running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an a b switch to go between them as far as other effects i really like what it does to my tc electronic flashback delay and corona chorus note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel but it controls the on off for the built in tremolo and reverb but it s sadly not included with the amp for my first tube amp i don t think i could have done much better i love the tone that i can get the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp it s feature rich and takes pedals well the other two amps that i was considering were a little less expensive and while i really feel that the vox is just a better all around amp i don t think you can go wrong with any one of the three the weight about lbs and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that i can think of while i would have picked up all three of the amps that i was looking at if i had the means i would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp this thing rocks best quality than polytune lighter and best switch brighter screen simply the best for fast tuning
938	fast shipping and love this handy little tool it has everything on it that i need to completely change my strings weather i am home or out somewhere and it is small enough to carry in my guitar case oh and great price thanks i decided i wanted to hang my guitars on my walls instead of having them take up space via floor stands just find a stud and drill in the screws they ll hold just fine i m really bad when it comes to stuff like this so i had my brother help me just make sure you know what you re doing because i thought i did when i really didn t at all the wall hangers look really nice in person and they keep the guitars held in place very nicely safely the only thing you should have to do extra after purchasing and installing these is creating a makeshift wallpad for behind where the guitar is hung if something happens that makes it hit the wall it won t damage the guitar or the wall this is as legit as it gets if done right though i ve had my guitars hung via string swing for months and i ve had no problems or concerns i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands it saves room and makes the room look cooler this is a handy little contraption i m using on one of my cheaper guitars it wasn t compatible with the other strap i ve been using and i had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap but it worked well with the strap on my other guitar i think it s a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly this is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars i tried this untreated microfiberpolish cloth on my gibson es because i had heard good things about it we ll begin with some stats the cloth is by and has an border stitched aroundthe edge it feels very soft to the touch and it is made in korea there is a small warning on theback of the package that states not designed for cleaning electrical devices you can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water rinse it out and hang it up to dry now to thereview my guitar has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy and shiny i have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body s front and back and backof the neck i was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off when going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish what i discovered about this cloth even with increased elbow grease is that it has it s limitations so if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out if the body oils have been there for awhile probably collecting dust then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument you should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it i decided to use dunlop s dunlop formula guitar polish cleaner to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges i used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely since then i have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the planet waves microfiber polish cloth it doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid i also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind you want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish the fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play i would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated on the fret board will get into the microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar so like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything i gave this untreated microfiber cloth stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean and polished with minimal effort my highexpectations based upon the blurb were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around it was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess nonetheless i like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime i will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time i am done playing i bought these primarily because they are so cheap the quality is good i would say not great but not terrible either they sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull they don t last nearly as long as elixirs but then again they are a lot cheaper than elixirs i would recommend these for practice no gigging with these as the sound isn t quite as crisp as i would think a performer would want for the price though it s hard to knock on them too much i am buying several more to mount on assorted amplifiers for practice room and studio on stage i prefer microphone boom holders it works well this is a classic design that people have used for years and i can see why it it isn t broke don t fix it the only suggestion i would make is to have a different soundhole cover maybe a sturdy plastic the soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket i think the price is a little high for what it is rubber and foam tube why do they charge so much i d like to know the markup i bought this bench on an amazon warehouse deal so that i could get it on prime delivery and was not disappointed at all the bench is very sturdy and comfortable the cushioning is thick and soft the item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds this bench is just what i was looking for and i m sure it will serve its purpose for many years i was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what i got there isn t too much to say about it it s sturdy it s adjustable it s a great price it really made playing easier for me puts on a good shine for your instrument i like the spray bottle applicator you can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings this capo works very well it applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design the rubber seems to hold well it s a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time but i ve had no issues as of yet my guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capo s design i also have a quick change keyser and i can say i prefer this one for practice sessions but the keyser for performing this one is too slow for the stage boy was i surprised and pleased when the banjo arrived and i took my first look at my new purchase the instrument is far superior than i would have imagined for the price i paid for it the workmanship and quality of the finish is really fine i recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants good value for their money the package was really well don e and arrived in good time i haven t learned to play the banjo yet but have played ukuleles guitar tipple and lute so i know a good instrument when i see it i bought this snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele i ve been using a blue snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it i thought she needed a snark of her own and it works like a charm i like the chromatic aspect of it because you can tune your strings to any pitch other than concert pitch sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or half step higher it s beautiful to look at clips on the head of the instrument with soft rubber feet and truly does an excellent job of tuning i teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one i go to the most and i have a lot of different tuners i rarely use any of my other tuners anymore relying mostly on the snarks that i have it uses a cr button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time i use my snark at least times a day either tuning my instruments or my students what i really love about these types of tuners is that you can talk while tuning since it feels the vibrations of the string instead of listening to it it will tune practically anywhere loud rooms etc and tune accurately i honestly don t see the purpose it doesn t seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar i ve used it a few times but don t see the benefit edit after coming back to read the other reviews it s obvious what happened this was shipped to me completely dry there was no grease lubricant qualities it was like a dry erase pad they need to improve their quality control i m changing my rating from star to star they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn t dried out yet to place this product in a air tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out
939	i bought this xlr splitter to split the lead vocal from foh to my monitor rack used this way it worked great and i never had any problems with signal loss or power issues i began using a transformer isolated xlr splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter my only issue with the hosa y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when i plugged it into our lead singer s microphone it would be great on a guitar mic or something that s close to the ground or horizontally placed but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand a classic mic clip simple inexpensive and durable enough keep several spares in your kit even the expensive ones break first off most audio racks have that annoying slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them instead of properly sized holes not this one not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them but it even includes screws so you don t have to try to figure out which of the sizes you ve collected over the years is going to fit i loaded it up with equipment and haven t had a worry about it since solid construction and the mounting just works this one is done right
940	i bought this when i was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be mic d it really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin i will be buying more of these my partner won t put a pickup in his guitar and i get tires of luggin an amp around along with the rest of the sys so this does the trick clip on the boom stand stick a sm on it and an sm to sing in and your set holds tight i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap sm wannabe from radio shack i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then i can easily position for use with a generous inch reach definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient just what i needed although i never gigged with it i think this would be great for any musician who gigs with a x or a x combo amp i used this with various fender and line amps and it worked great for amplifying the sound would buy again if given the circumstance i always put my recorder on the stage on a mini tripod that would get kicked over by band members now i put my recorder on my monitor mike stand and don t worry about it anymore simplicity at its best summaryat it is a great size and ok quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig other options are available slightly longer and also with a nd compartment inside no padding or impact resistance is provided but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle also available longer or with chambered configuration on different models pros good size for speaker stands mic stands guitar stands music stands other than the top shelf and other what not you may want to cram in there depending on your style affordable at availalbe on prime shippingcons this model is one compartment for speaker stands you may want a compartment model lack of any impact resistance the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas it would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands detailsin one of my bags i was able to put folding mic stands music stand other than the top piece with the shelf that does not fit even if the bag was empty folding guitar stands and still had room for some more if i wanted to put more in bag was getting kind of heavy at that point in a sconed i was able to put on stage stands oss ss b speaker stands they fit with extra room on the ends in this bag there is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands i am considering exchanging this one for a section bag so the speaker stands are separated but probably will just keep this one the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas and a zipper and handles when laying empty it is long x about wide and lays flat seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around but for serves a basic purpose with affordability i m loving this pop filter it looks professional in design and feels very sturdy on the mic stand the built in shock mount is definitely a plus i like it because some beginners try to grab the mic in the studio when recording vocals this immediately let s them know to just speak into the microphone also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want amazon was great in conjunction with the seller my item arrived lightning fast amazon is like music to my ears and that s why their products are in my studio simply the bomb by now you have probably read about the problem with the usb connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the usb functionality unusable an amazon reviewer referred to this as a fatal flaw and i heartily agree i experienced this firsthand then read folks struggling with the issue on the mackie support blogs when i called mackie support to seek a fix i was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware they sent me a new mackie board from the newer lots and i returned my old one i have not had any problems with the usb functionality since i am thankful to mackie for the great customer service especially since i addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired i m assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem but if it does contact mackie to get a replacement at this point i am still running the board through its paces but thus far so good
941	this is good for now keeps my guitar from drying out warping cracking for the money it works recommend this product guardian well it is padded but i ve only gigged once since having the item with rehearsals held prior and i can say that the case is nicked up pretty good as they say in the south yes it will last because it is a guitar case but there s no way there s enough security to protect an instrument on a plane now that s for flight cases to handle but don t even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the guardian fails to guard against crushing your hardware this item is not one of the better cases out there but it does suffice and it does look good the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great say that now though after using it outside the house times and you d be a lying sob i have been using a zt lunchbox amp for about a year blindfolded you won t confuse it with a marshall stack or a blackface deluxe but for a small portable solid state amp it works as advertised people that say it is loud aren t kidding but there are limits the sound from the speaker requires some space to develop up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass i use mine for practice at home and for low volume band rehearsals i played it once on stage mic d through a pa but wasn t happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a speaker to me it sounds best with humbuckers but i ve played single coil guitars fender and gibson through it with usable results if you are after clean volume you might be disappointed it only gets so loud before distortion and noise becomes annoying players that use a lot of distortion e g metal will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume while the zt lunchbox isn t as versatile as some other small amps it is great for a one trip load in at rehearsals one thing to consider is adding the matching zt extension cabinet it makes a big difference in two ways two speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound also because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased this is a big help at rehearsals i point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room i ve tried using a guitar speaker cab a pa speaker and a pa floor monitor as an extension speaker but the zt extension cabinet sounds best to me it s the same size as the zt lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack them for an ultra portable guitar or harmonica amplifier that can get decently loud the zt lunchbox is hard to beat but if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a speaker works better one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ i like the old version more these are a little tricky to mount but do track well and are not obnoxious looking like the snark tuners i ve been playing long enough to remember when small electronic tuners were the size of a paperback book and had prices approaching new tuners like the snark sn b are a joy in comparison the display is good sized and easy read without my reading glasses and the tuner responds quickly and accurately the only complaint i ve heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight yeah so it won t fall off while you re using it or playing and you shouldn t leave anything clamped to your guitar when you aren t using it anyway you can t beat the price for a tuner this easy to use and it comes with a cleaning carrying bag too i ve used it with standard and altered tunings on guitar bass banjo mandolin ukulele and tipple this one works one suggestion for any younglings reading this take it from an old f electronic tuners are great especially for tuning back stage or in other places where it isn t quiet but please do yourself a favor and learn to tune by ear i ve met too many young players that cannot tune a guitar without an electronic tuner if the battery dies they are tone deaf trust me the ability to tune by ear is a skill you will always use if a string goes sharp or flat while i m playing i can tune it back without stopping i would not be able to do that if i hadn t learned to tune by ear
942	a very handy item great for sitting by your practice amp when you don t want to be bothered with stepping all over your footers the wire could be a little heavier but you can t beat the value the plugs are the standard screw down type with well soldered joints i ve used this now for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord i was new to pedal effects new to pedal boards and new to the challenge of how to power it all i did my research and settled on pedal train for the board the mini with case and the one spot for power this bundle including an pedal chain a few adapters and the power supply does it all in fact it may be overkill i only have pedals so i have to hide secure the rest of the chain with twist ties and the adapters never used em but it is a complete kit if you need more than this i don t know what to tell ya you need this to get the most out of your super champ xd amp the only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic no telling how long the switches will last fender tends to make good products price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp imo these cables are really the best they sound perfectly they look and feel strong their contact is perfect life time warrany recommended the only solid white leather strap i could find that didn t have any ornamentation it is of average quality but for the price i wasn t expecting much it looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black ibanez rg xx in a world of round wound strings flat wounds the original bass starings aren t as popular these are nice and bright love em i ve been using a standard size pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit i use it to keep pedals in place a line m a seymour duncan twin tube classic and a live wire a b switch the first two are pretty heavy and bulky i needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case being carried vertically with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of them i decided to try out the power grip and have been extremely impressed first i stripped the old velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly it all came off pretty easily i then applied one strip of power grip to each of the bottom panels on the pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals i then let everything sit for hours as recommended after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured the pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metal on metal abrasion however you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhere i also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around with some effort and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bit the grip also bonds to itself unlike velcro where you re keeping track of male and female tape when replacing it i would recommend following the manufacturer s instructions and applying this stuff to clean hard non porous surfaces i ve heard that the adhesive doesn t work on rubber wood etc many pedals have rubber padding feet on the bottom but i ve had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape on you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides get a few rolls as a meter doesn t go as far as you d think
943	i only use dunlops for a number of reasons first the texture of the plastic gives a good sound and easier to hold on to second the grippy texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to thirdly they make many sizes for all the right occasions two thumbs up use these for general acoustic guitar strumming they are not too thin and not too thick i use the mm mm and mm sizes i put these on my campfire acoustic black yamaha f and they look stunning the tone seems slightly brighter however i go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference i am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings since they are replacing plastic pins i am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective sounds good these pins are a little thin small so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing if you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins this may not be necessary however even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole the string should go all the way through the hole into the body of the guitar insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches if possible it should be listing toward the neck then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin the pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole if you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you re trying to get your guitar in tune typically ruining a brand new string in the process if you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body correctly or hanging on the pin incorrectly also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation these fit my guitar snugly but not tightly however i do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that i do a lot of string bending a whole step or more sometimes using two fingers strength to bend that far overall i am quite pleased with these great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels solid recommend this if you re tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music i tried another mini amps but all sounds like toys this is totally different it s the real thing made of wood very good looking and powerfull sound the only thing i don t like is that it s hard to get clean tones from it and with a les paul it s harder beside that it s perfect
944	if you can t find a container and add your own sponge then buy this keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential i think this item should cost three bucks at most and would still yield a healthy profit i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better i use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughts if you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood it doesn t seem to work i think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn t seem to absorb any water definitely holds the guitar well a little pricey but probably worth it i m a fan of dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one got this tuner for my new bass clipped it onto the headstock was able to tune without plugging it into the amp clear bright display might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars very happy holds my lies paul and schechter guitars very well had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened
945	for you can t go wrong its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice nice and fine product working for many hours with no degradation of the sound no too much heat and easy plug for instant job a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item i bough for my primo and he really loves it
946	this is such a nice bag for the price nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever there is a handle and a shoulder strap plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front brand name good string good tone seem to last awhile but i change strings often so never really know how long a set will last fantastic strap nope it isn t leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff but it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my cc ot banjo that has a really tight spacing all the others i tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass once again extremely comfortable and sturdy so had to buy another so i can just have one on each pricey as far as strings go a lot of people swear by them but i get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less i ve used several different kinds of strings over several years playing i m no expert but these strings sound good to me subtle differences with different styles of strings so its a preference thing if you havent tried em they re worth a shot don t know what the delay was but it took forever to get here the picks look like they will work although they are a little hard to bend we will see if it s what i was looking for thanks i got of these for my electric guitars they do indeed work and the stand legs are decent do be careful when un folding as pinching of skin would be very easy the guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy the guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well i have had no problem with the foam cushion so far i have modern finishes on my guitars i don t think i can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing my epiphone lp seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the turser strat knockoff but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault i also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include all in all these aren t bad not quite perfect but a good value for the money
947	this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar i sing worship praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely i don t think it is the same as an sm but it is exactly what i need built to last and it is a shure these just sound flat in comparison to elixir nanowebs and they don t feel as good either i guess i just prefer coated acoustic strings i love this product i t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast so y don t have to life it over your head well worth the price bought this on a whim it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion when used with a pedalboard rig it doesn t add much except for hiss unfortunately sweet sound with an older fender amp unit though does not sound good with updated equipment line equipment roland units i d say definitely do not get this if you re a tech or gear head get it if you re a simple player with few fx in your arsenal it does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar amp wah and guitar or amp wah guitar and expression pedal nothing else i ve tied it to has seemed to work out though probably a wasted product with where i m headed as a technical player but good for beginners and intermediate levels into king crimson fripp styles don t go for this for modeling i like a mellow sound with a smooth feel these strings are what i needed and they perform d addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar guardian well it is padded but i ve only gigged once since having the item with rehearsals held prior and i can say that the case is nicked up pretty good as they say in the south yes it will last because it is a guitar case but there s no way there s enough security to protect an instrument on a plane now that s for flight cases to handle but don t even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the guardian fails to guard against crushing your hardware this item is not one of the better cases out there but it does suffice and it does look good the first day i got it someone said nice case it looks great say that now though after using it outside the house times and you d be a lying sob this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is size i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me beware because you d figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there given the advertising even the guy at guitar center when i called to find out what was going on told me to go with lute hole i never had a use for such an item before very recently but upon necessity i found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar even if it does fit be very very careful in fact be very very wary as i briefly heard a light cracking noise when i tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the g s specs i ve read elsewhere that it kills your tone but i had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig ultimately i spent nearly more than i wanted to just for this kind of item what is it they say in this era caveat emptor
948	i purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago and have always loved it i only use pedals and this is always one of them it sounds great is indestructable and takes up almost no space the controls are great and you can get a large variety of sounds i have played boutique chorus pedals and the boss is loads better in every way you will not regret this purchase pros easy to use no hum small sonds awesome indestructabecons noneif you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever will last forever and sounds incredible get this the cry baby has proven itself since the s it is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock it takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level there is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voice over applications it does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone note use a good preamp or a external eq this is my second set of these i bought the st set in the s and i m still using them on the guitar that they matched black hardware i was impressed with the quality of the st set and the nd set is just as good money well spent i love guitar picks i have tested alot of them and this is by far the best one that i have found yet they are perfect to hold and very tough although i do wear through them quickly but i do that to all picks these are descent quality cables great price i own many of these just a good basic cable love the price and they shipped quickly this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use it is well made and i would buy it again if needed this pedal is awesome i use it the most of all my pedals because it s pretty much perfect i can get completely different sounds out of it it s also true bypass so it will not effect your tone when it is off it s much smaller than the big muff pi which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard just to let you all know this is not an overdrive or distortion pedal it is a fuzz pedal so don t buy it expecting overdrive also when it s turned on you will hear a hum but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights and muff pedals hum alot none of that makes me dislike the pedal it s one of the hest fuzz pedals ever i use it in front of a wah and that s all i ll ever need to use pedal wise get this pedal
949	a very attractive and well constructed strap i ve been somewhat disappointed with some of the more expensive straps but this one is excellent and not so expensive all the buttons fit well snug and it adjusts easily and quickly i have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex space and noise is an issue as a beginning guitarist i contemplated a small amp but decided on the mini tone master because in my apartment the smaller the better also i had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that i am i just wanted something no frills that was small compact with enough quality sound to help me as i practice the mini tone master delivers well i was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone it does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery battery life is also pretty good i ve had the same battery in there for several months already playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far it is a little frustrating sometimes as another reviewer mentioned to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling i found a setting that was acceptable to my ears while i didn t need volume this little guy can be loud no weakness there i also plugged an acoustic electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well bought these to replace the ones that i had previously ordered from another vendor these have good shielding not like the others i started useing these about yrs ago they are worth the investmentthere grat for a long performance takes alot of pressure off the shoulderif you have never used one befor try it you will like it i have been playing for over three decades and it has been a while since i have owned an electric guitar i bought this amp along with a epi les paul all i can say is wow this is a great combination this amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects well built and looks even better in person than the picture plenty of power as well better than anything including the stage quality amps like marshals from back in the day a great practice amp but good enough you could use it for a small gig going to pick up the optional foot switch if you buy you won t be disappointed
950	i like the tone of this one better than the stock one in my champ and in my kustom kontender also i like it more than the jj but the difference is subtle the jj version seems to be a bit brighter and slightly more noise in a good way but not what i want for me but not great either the needle never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch it also appears that the tuner wasn t reliable on the pitch end either recently ordered the red snark tuner here on amazon and i think it s much better the intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it the snark is a little more bulky ultimately the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch and readability snark wins out this tuner works for sure but i don t think it s the best out there the snark is cheaper too
951	grabbed these on impulse as i needed some new ones normally i used the old fender medium or heavy picks but i gotta say these are great stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely not sure what could be said to prove it but they just feel great great solid switch works well for giving your telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel as for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all i can say is that i have this in several of my teles and i have never had a problem with the switch travel being too much for the plate i ve been using these strings on my guitars for the last years they always give me consistent results i consider them one of the greatest bargains out there this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power its easy to install and keeps things simple no more extra messy cabling glad i got it thanks to amazon for the quick delivery they call these mini tuners but to me they are just right some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho i installed them on a prs se santana in just a few minutes they were direct drop ins to use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock insert the string and then turn the tuning peg you ll feel it lock in then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune they are really good tuners and i think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer i love the dunlop formula polish and cleaner it works really well and i like the easy to use pump spray mechanism i ve used other brands in the past and they had poor spray nozzles this one works almost like a mist it does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints i spray it directly on the surface of the guitar and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth after i m done the shine looks glassy and great the yellow material has a rough texture coated over it that gives it a nice rubbery grip with a smooth snappy tone it is just as described i am happy amazon always comes through without a hitch it was delivered as usual before stated time i like how with this pedal not only does it not have a heavy click when you press down but if you are playing in a dark room the led lights are nice and bright true bypass i m telling you get it seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money my banjo likes it it was shipped quickly and in good shape thanks purchased this for my son to use on his guitars he absolutely loves it has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars prompt shipping great price great product i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk imports often have threads other than inch sae it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads quick install works like a dream for the price i can hardly complain but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a fender strat replacement checked it against my american standard mim strat and squier and it would not fit any of them should have just used one of my dog s chew bones and cut it myself would have been more accurate bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am re doing i ve learned the hard way that there are some things you don t skimp on and this is one switchcraft is what we used in the air force years ago and are still some of the best made electronic components out there
952	terrific all in one must have tool for guitarists i have been using the older style planet waves model of this winder cutter bridge pin tool and when it came in i was a little skeptical about the new model i am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk i have used the planet waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable they keep on keeping on and i have one in every case buy you ll love it and if not you can always return it hope this helps good strings great prce this is a great capo clamps well and quickly the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break aluminum not plastic i like it and it was well under the price of others great price for picks spanning from light heavy picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks
953	it doesn t seem to be loud enough for a recording device that i have but other than that it works as described originally put off by the low price i went with the reviews simply awesome this amp is packed with features beginner intermediate level player would be very pleased the best part is it s not at all complex to learn the features i really like epiphone products they are well made easy to play guitars i also purchased an ep les paul special ebony from amazon a while back but i received this uke defective i expected when i plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but i couldn t here anything at all totally dead there are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down i m disappointed because i expect gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory i actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when i got over to his house and it didn t work in front of him i just requested a return exchange from amazon if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me i seem to have bad luck with electric acoustic guitars when purchased through amazon i had to send back my dean string elec acoust to amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem i do want to state that this is a beautiful uke with nice feeling nylon strings fine wood high polished surface high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture if this uke was working i would have given it a or
954	they are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them i had earnie ball on previously and i might switch back or go to dunlop witch i put on my sting and love but i probably won t get these again ever great little tool to assist you while replacing strings cleaning or tuning keeps headstock still and then folds up neatly to fit in a drawer kit or pocket i ve been using this stuff for about years or so and i really don t play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy the so called lower priced brother to the enormous line fbv shortboard mkii pedal while cut down still has a lot of the same features same quality build self powered when attached to my line modeling amp a real nice feature one less power supply to hook up foot switches are easy to use built in tuner works great the volume wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp sounds and have them instantly available when you play either at home or on stage a nice work mat of adequate size that provides a nice non static covering for the bench grey color makes it easy to easy to see small parts etc as opposed to some black mats where black objects are hard to differentiate not as much padding as i would like my old bag had more other than that i like the pockets and overall design
955	well made and the perfect length for my needs the shielding was great as well the end connectors were well made and strong i notice mixed reviews here i suppose when an item sells for instead of there may be a potential for quality control issues but hey buy of them and if even one turns out to be bad you re still way ahead on the deal seems to me as good as any connector i ve ever bought i was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my fostex mr recorder and did a little research on the xenyx just looking at it with it s inputs number of controls i would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks imagine my surprise when after reading the positive reviews that i discovered this thing was only i bought it immediately and right out of the box it did exactly everything i was expecting it to this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the fostex i m quite excited about my future recordings using the i m like a kid with a new toy highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost there good mics it connected well in the nady smps x phantom power unit i bought i ll update how i hook it up check
956	this thing rocks best quality than polytune lighter and best switch brighter screen simply the best for fast tuning
957	love it makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy quiet power supply lots of cables and end caps and adapters for what you d pay for a single power adapter it s nice not having to dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play about the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters but i m sure you can find them somewhere good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply have not used the light as much as i thought i might but it works okay each light has multiple independent settings the beams are narrow but you get two of them the major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag something in the bag will trigger the switch and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it there is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transport also you cannot really tell from the product picture but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects it does not work well or at all with object more than inch thick i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky very obvious calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and red still i can t fault it s tuning prowess it s quick and pretty on the money it replaced my roland boss tu h well more handy for tuning my sweet la patrie nylon strung motif would buy again but i d really prefer a more subdued color
958	i find that if i play this pedal along with my boss super chorus pedal my guitar with tex mex pickups captures a lot gilmour s sound tonality i bought these to replace a pair of ath m s i had for years i used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio these have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully i play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what i hear inside the headphones listening to music on them is a joy everyone has an opinion about a burn in period mine seemed to open up at about hours i listen to music about hours a day this is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest i ve tried dozens of od pedals in the past i hate this term boutiques and non boutiques before i finally stick with ss bs mini od as my always on pedal cos that thing is a supersonic bad ass since it could cover my needs on clean boost edge of breakup clean sound distortion or even a messed up broken speaker fuzz tonez only with your guitar volume knob please note that you ll need to have a treble bleed circuit to do this okay back to this ehx i m kinda tired of messing around with guitar volume knob on the mini so i bought this hot tubes as my clean breakup sound so that i could hit it hard with a cranked up mini od and this my friend jesus approved the point is this pedal s so great and has a great range of dirt also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range it s literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps i can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper ps look at the price do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal just get it try it and see if you like it jeez
959	this is a good durable mount i like the look of it as well as the light weight feel not much else to be said this microphone s quality is amazing i just hooked it up to my pc windows and it worked no hassle whatsoever nothing to install or hoops to jump through just works great i recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises the stand that comes with it is very stable but it is low to the ground or in this case desk table so it may pick up some unwanted background noise computer fans mouse clicks movement etc i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately i am missing out on a lot of this thing s capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what i need it for it s perfect i use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks i researched a ton before i bought this one touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys i could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my band s needs just fine awesome it does the job perfectly now my vocals sound way better and clearer this filter is awesome and for the price can t get any better
960	i bought the hell babe years ago it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since the same one i have never had a major problem with it the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal its no crybaby and im glad it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn t no matter how much i tweaked it i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more especially since it has the auto off and spring back it really makes my solos rip buy it you will have a ball my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality thank u guys bought this in early march this year have it in line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board no problems with it at all it works as advertised i ve found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my fender g dec amp so what does that tell you not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because i love mine for the money you can t get one that touches it so what if it s not that means you have more green stuff to buy other things since buying this one having it work so well i now own a couple of other behringer pedals this behringer compressor sustainer compare s to the boss cs the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone compression level is very good and all for not putting down the boss but for this price you can t go wrong i had to tune my guitar and i bought this well it works great i got the sound i wanted
961	i have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back this was difficult so for the longest time when i had my studio setup i had a mixing board going into the interface it is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine this board is great no sliders which i had to clean the board has all the same features that were on my channel dod board that i used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk the only thing that i am not keen upon is that there is no on off switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time it makes the stuff i do in logic easy this is a home use unit great for the price as well as for its quality i m reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my behringer xenyx mixer and i finally did after nearly throwing in the towel turns out i was using my mixer s cd tape switch incorrectly thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback i finally went on you tube and found a behringer guy that has a video that s less than minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple i was doing wrong i was over thinking it once i got it to working correctly i could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly including the control on my pc that controlled the recording volume for this unit so now i m looking forward to doing some real recording with it using audacity as my main recording software edit i did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really really pleased with the results i can hardly wait to do some more recording with this so to the arrogant salesman who bad mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a lexicon unit i won t be needing that i m quite happy with this little interface thank you very much and to everyone else don t forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your pc and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on board sound card thanks behringer this is a great value this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones very fun to use comes with a power supply very easy to control i enjoy using this to play alone it is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it it can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat my only reluctance about getting this was i thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but i unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does it gets down my guitar tracks in ipad and sounds terrific so the price tag isn t such a big deal no learning curve simply connect the included cable from the jam to your pin ipad dock plug in your guitar pull up garageband select an amp click on the icon in garageband that shows the guitar cable end then select on for monitoring hit record and start jamming man that is all there is to it i ve not been one to record on computers for a long time preferring instead to use such things as fostex track recorders behringer mixers digitech effect pedals etc but this is going to change all that awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use update i mentioned a behringer mixer above xenyx i discovered that this apogee jam will take the signal routed standard guitar type in cable from the behringer s control out l mono thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs both microphone guitar the sound quality doing this is excellent i ve recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully you just have to be careful not to overdrive the jam consequently my opinion of the apogee jam is even higher than it was when i wrote my initial review in march i may not even need that focusrite box now i got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue when i record a track either with the audio recorder or guitar amp screens in garageband on my ipad ios the recording is great but once i toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable here s the other part of this i can use apogee jam guitar interface and irig pre microphone interface and garageband behaves as it should and i can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever the focusrite support folks suggested i do a backup of my ipad contents and then do a software restore but i opted to return the unit instead since the apogee and irig both work perfectly with garageband so i don t know if the unit is having a problem with ios or i just happened to get a lemon but i ll find out when the new one comes next week if it works correctly i ll update this review after doing a few recordings but i would say if you ve just updated to ios or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit you might want to hold off on that upgrade update got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my ipad as suggested by a focusrite support tech and still have the problem i discussed above so this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me if anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution please let me know
962	excellenti like i am very happyi am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you this pedal is beyond loud it s to the point where if you crank this pedal with a watt amp with an speaker you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood to match it up with the clean tone that i get out of my amp i have to set the level in between and as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard however if used as a fuzz pedal instead it truly shines since this is really what it is does it have distortion yes is it valuable as such not in my opinion it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that another gripe i have is the volt slot most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply not so with this pedal you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries which sux imo especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain anyways while this is fun to play with you should definitely consider the sound you are going for if you prefer to play a more grungy or s era metal then this will work for you for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere imo a breeze to install on my mac mini simple to use with garageband the bad reviews here are bizarre written by inept people who either can t handle the install or have a buggy pc or os i was up and running minutes after i tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging there s plenty of specs details videos on the interwebs about this software go do some research see if you like it it s way better than the drum kits that come with garageband and there s plenty of kits to expand with i got the vintage rock kit and i love it almost as much as i love pizza which i will marry some day i like a cheese pizza some call it plain but with the right blend of sauce cheese and crust there s nothing plain about it it s somewhat complex much like myself we are a perfect match pizza and me we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom i m not exclusively a thin crust guy sometimes i dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish the only weak point in this pizza i mean software is that you can t do a cymbal swell apparently it s the same with all these virtual kits regardless of brand but it would be nice if someone toontrack would address it by including a side stick attack on the crashes if you try to do a cymbal swell you hear the initial stick on cymbal ting with each attack so it s kind of a ting ting ting ting sound instead of bwooooosssshhhhh i m sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a ting ting bwoosh loop no ting ting do i get a fortune cookie with that pizza time ohhh myyyy loooove my darlin i hun ger for your crust bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp and i think they improved the sound over the original eh ones these are considered boutique tubes but i think they re popular for a reason sounds great easy to adjust nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board worth price hands down
963	when i ordered these i wasn t expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly foot cable it turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all i plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static interference or buzz to explain the low price and all i got was a nice clean signal highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable i purchased this key on a whim when it arrived the instructions were not clear but i sat the dial to loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning too loose and deep so i increased the setting to and repeated almost the sound i wanted so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern perfect i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest using the setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms octave apart next i worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side i used on the batter side and on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound i wanted the bass drum came next i set the batter side tension notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained this is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned set i ll never go back to tuning by ear you ll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and don t forget to write down your optimum settings these cables work well in my jam space they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in gig ing but at the price that s fair don t get me wrong these are good cables and for the price i am very happy i d buy more for sure i would probalby uses these for gigging as well if i didn t have heavier duty jumpers available as the title says these are a great value and work well this is a great item because it is small lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere guitar mic stand etc at the same time because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don t pack it carefully when traveling etc the clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong the clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than sheets of paper on the clip board this doesn t happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig day etc for this price it s a good buy in my opinion and with a little care you will get more than your money s worth out of it grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year i got three single channels and two dual channel units set them up for the keyboard player dual channel bass and guitar player di s plus one from a di output on a effects module that were all on stage and connected them into my snake running to the back of the venue crystal clear sound from all units straight into a recording mixing console i was impressed not one pop hiss crack or anything from these units all night even was able to adjust the pad setting on the guitar and bass to cut the signal a bit so i didn t have to use so much compression to keep the signal from clipping going to the recording no telling how long these units will last but for the price who cares just buy another one and move on check out how these boxes sound on the band s youtube page gerrelltheband to hear the sound coming from these units near studio quality i was looking for a trs cable for my band room i wanted a quality cable with reasonalbe durability although i was willing to compromise some durability for cost and i feel this was an excellent choice yes there are better cables available at a much higher price but i feel this is a well built cable and great value
964	well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one you can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag guitar pics what more can i say nice feel and look never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand it s easy to use on stage it can be used with only one hand and it has a low profile that doesn t take up a lot of space when folded and it doesn t stick out as an eyesore on stage i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it
965	i replaced the metric pots in my greco lp and needed new top hats these look great and work perfectly it fit my american vintage s strat my guitar had an hole pickguard i ordered an hole pickguard and it fit like a glove the guitar is ply plastic black white black this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like i am happy with the purchase if you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about then this kit is for you changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack i put them on a dipinto mach v with that levis rat fink guitar strap i need to exchange i use this on all my guitars i tried some off brands and i ve found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal
966	at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar i m using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface unfortunately these angle the speakers down by default so i had to do some cutting and rearranging but it worked out if you need to cut these to fit your speakers try to find something better than scissors because it s quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them i purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap way too small maybe like a third of the width i just have a normal planet waves strap and it does not fit however it does hold the xds transmitter nicely and securely so looks like i will have to get creative with duct tape or something update when attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap it stays on pretty snugly but you need to attach it with something i got these because they were recommended replacements for the fostex t rp they fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads for the price they are worth it
967	grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand but i guess that s how all of them are works very well on acoustic guitars this is great for adding pedals you cant go wrong for this item with the price even more so thank you these are high quality thick guitar picks the colors are great unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging i know the company is trying to save money but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive almost didn t know what it was because of this just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail this strap has a fantastic old school look and vibe and i ve never had it slip off while playing the only downside is that it s a bit rough on any loose skin i could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up i can feel it on my neck but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t shirt for of situations these strap rocks
968	good quality great price easy to install easy to lock and unlock fast delivery better than going to the always overpriced guitar center i have used fender medium picks since the late s yes they are made in china now but they are still the same pick as far as i can tell the picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip lock baggie all were in there all of them fender mediums purchased from b g music associates shipped from illinois to california in days with normal shipping the picks are great and i couldn t be happier with the order whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where i stand recommended if you want need a nice little bag of fender mediums disapointed the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound it sound muffled i will have to replace it soon unhappy with it actually i already replaced them the method of attachment is poorly designed it doesn t matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions expensive locks too works great with my fender super champ x amplifier however it does not come with a cable i would highly recommend disclaimers obtained free as part of amazon s vine program tested on ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players yes this tuner is for you i tested this diminutive tuner on sopranino ohana soprano pono concert kala string tenor pono it s tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there it s a bit problematic on the sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the top tuning is easy just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen if it s red you re off if it s green you re in tune when you re off little bars will display by the note letter left if you re low right if you re high tune in the direction needed until there s one bar on each side of the note and the note s name turns green quick and easy i ve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it s dead accurate as others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock but it s held together fine so far and i ve had it for weeks let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal and tons of fun i can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live but and this is a big but this is my first one star review ever my first less than star review ever same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it used less than ten times total light use at home i wasn t even wearing shoes by the way a gigging recording musician for over years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff bummer too great idea poorly executed i will not buy anther one i will not recommend to other musicians
969	the epiphone les paul guitars don t particularly sound that great but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar but you re not completely sure if they will stick with it if you can spend another and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele the reason for this is because for if they decide it s not something they want to do anymore you can resell it at the same price you bought it for as long as it is still in decent condition and little no money is lost second if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a better or more high end guitar mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use i have a couple different high end guitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still i ll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this here s the deal with this pedal it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money in my opinion for spending less than for a distortion pedal whether it is your first pedal or th pedal a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock s influences i would probably buy the phase today though as it has different positions to choose from i assume including the original set up as one of them well i need to correct this this review was for the old models the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain i will probably get an eh small stone now though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough if at all about the sound quality of their products the capitalists have become too greedy and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live god help us great universal power supply for your pedals and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome i have two of these that i mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with and you won t get any noise interference with its isolated outputs excellent stomp box you can dial it right in to get that srv sound very sturdy and very well made a must have for any blues player i have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but i hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound this pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts this pedal has three preamp settings ts hot and turbo it s great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar one nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings for example if you set on the turbo setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by boss roland boss mt metal zone overdrive distortion pedal no other choice on the market imho this is the one to get i have two and would buy again if i needed another one i don t have any problems with this pedal but for the price i would just go with the way huge aqua puss for an analog delay if you are looking to spend not too much on a distortion pedal in my opinion this is the one to get there are a few more different models and brands that are good but i could use this pedal no matter what style of music i m playing and not feel like i have to sell it if i start a new project i personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner the reason why is the led lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage the pitch black is nice and bold and bright one reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time so its a give and take issue
970	had no issues in the months there is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your real picks which helps with its looks it works great not much i can say beyond that these picks have proven their worth when i thrash them on my strings in an epic guitar solo or extreme metal i find myself playing all too often great picks would buy em again bottom line these guitar picks are outstanding small yet sturdy enough to hold a full size guitar nothing to put together just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms a very good price for an excellent product got them in days and love them so much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing
971	this light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely the light from the leds has a blue tint to it i d prefer something more white each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting i gave starts because it doesn t get quite as bright as i d like but it does the job it seems well made and will operate off battery power as well as an ac adapter which is included this cup holder clamps on easily and really holds your drink so you dont have to worry about it the insert part is made out of thick material so it will smash down when you pack it up you dont really notice the name on both sides at gigs just a cold beer in front of you thats always in the same place i love it i own the older color bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one i love the size weight and led bulbs on this one though it has a nice color throw too it also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but this new led version is built with less quality when you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one about every second they do not stop flashing when it s plugged in since it don t have an on off switch if you are using this on a switcher then it wouldn t be a problem i d prefer the light to stop when the music stops but it don t when you try to adjust the audio flashing it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by plastic pegs sticking through the back they will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around within hour of getting it i had to take it apart push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place i love the light but it s not as useful to me since it s always flashing it s possible i have a defective one not sure the cool bright led bulbs are the best part of this light update i played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better when you turn it all the down the lights stopped flashing until the music started again the one i have never stops flashing even when the music stops i guess i got a bad one i buy many of these cable and they all test correctly with a meter and they all work great so far i haven t had any issues at all they feel well made and i will continue to use them for the bands pa i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it it has a lot of power and noise behind it it is a little starter amp just in case the picture was a little deceiving i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion with distortion it sounds great it is a solid piece of work and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp one of the the best lights i own small but fills a gym with light for under what more could you ask as the other reviewers boast this is a great unit and i hope it lasts a long long time
972	i really like the idea of a pick pocket in the strap in fact i like it so well that when i replace the strap on my other guitar i ll make sure it also has the same type of strap this thing is amazing like many i cannot afford a tube amp this transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps i played years ago sustain and harmonics are insane preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones the unit is very heavy and rugged the only component i would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost believe it or not i ve yet to use this screen i was short a shock mount for one of my cad condensers i ve yet to use that mic again go figure but i love the way screen and mount look i know so esoteric but i m still giving it stars thanks again amazon okay i used to tune my guitar online however adding a for this item is worth it it is so accurate and works great so far i saw that some people complaint that the tuner comes without a battery but mine come with one probably it is because i bought it from amazon lt not from some sort of seller in amazon moreover there s also a warranty for this item for those who want to start playing a guitar like me i strongly recommend to get this tuner you won t regret owyea i disliked having to wait a month to receive what i could ve gotten at my local music store the capo does what its does these capo i know will lose their tension in time i thought i had chosen a different capo that s what happens when i stay at the computer too long without my glasses
973	wow these cables are made really sturdy and the noiseless feature is priceless definitely a real good value for the money the sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn t going to last long also trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing i m going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it i don t play with a guitar below my waist i am six feet tall while very well made wide comfortable and good looking this sling was far too short and had to be returned disclaimers obtained free as part of amazon s vine program tested on ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players yes this tuner is for you i tested this diminutive tuner on sopranino ohana soprano pono concert kala string tenor pono it s tiny so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there it s a bit problematic on the sopranino as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side so it need to clip to the top tuning is easy just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen if it s red you re off if it s green you re in tune when you re off little bars will display by the note letter left if you re low right if you re high tune in the direction needed until there s one bar on each side of the note and the note s name turns green quick and easy i ve compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it s dead accurate as others have noted the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock but it s held together fine so far and i ve had it for weeks
974	i had been leery about leaving my fender string custom jazz bass on guitar stands until i met the hercules gs b the stand is built like a tank with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly my bass weighs about pounds with the strap and with its long neck fits perfectly in the hercules with the body of the bass resting well balanced against the padded legs the design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and i experimented with trying to tip the bass over it will take more than an accident to tip the bass off its stand the self closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism i would have preferred the stand being a more conservative all black a good moderately priced guitar stand i had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result i replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware store a good moderately priced guitar stand i would recommend purchasing it for the price this inch canvas bag is great bag for toting around a couple of folded foot light stands and miscellaneousbooms etc i own other gator products and have been very pleased with the quality and performance note that this bag does not have padding and does not have a divider but for the price paid i still think it s an excellent bargain
975	after years of buying stands all i can say is that i should have invented it myself i have many expensive guitars and i wouldn t use a inexpensive stand before i found this design so if you re shopping and wonder if it s really good you can trust me because i m way over qualified to pass judgement on this and i care about guitars and about amazon shoppers this guitar strap is very comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric yamaha guitar very durable and affordable my only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would colors are abit too flashy just an all around nice case good construction good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver this isn t one of those semi walled cases this is just a normal gig bag works for me in fact i bought another for my classical i love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly the tuner picks up vibrations so it doesn t require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar there s just one button so it s idiot proof however the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soon speaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but i hate that they used the cr battery it just doesn t last long and in brazil it s really hard to find this battery at all i cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand i had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over this one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over small and sturdy i use it at practice and during our live shows you can t go wrong with this
976	you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage cable crackles when plug in jack is moved gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product great value good quality and sound very pleased with this purchase high value for low risk you will not be disappointed definitely the best combination of price durability and sound quality that i ve come across plus the tweed look really grows on you ordered a bunch for the studio and a bunch more for home holds up well even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on do it i had the opportunity to try a set of elixir nanoweb light gauge strings in both phosphor bronze and bronze instead of writing a separate review for each i figured i d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs the phosphor bronze strings are mounted on a brand new guild f rc guitar it is a concert sized guitar with a florentine cutaway the body is brazilian rosewood and the top is adirondack red spruce i have always heard that phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a rosewood guitar i would agree the tone is nicely balanced maybe a bit weak in the bass but the strings are new and in a couple days i expect them to sound a bit better the notes are articulated well and there is a nice midrange tone the nanoweb coating is nice it protects the strings from corrosion finger sweat really can do a job on strings without dulling the sound i think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original guild strings and it just plays easier the strings are mounted on a gibson hummingbird an iconic mahogany body spruce topped dreadnaught sized guitar again s are recommended for mahogany guitars as popular as the hummingbird is i was never totally pleased with the sound of it it is a great guitar to strum along with while singing but it almost sounded too muddied not enough articulation between the different strings the elixir strings really bring out something extra from the gibson it sounds a lot better and feels easier to play the strings are easier to play partially because of the coating partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity without going out of tune the bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes i am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the martin sps that were on it prior to the switch elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings in the end you won t spend more money on what i think are far superior strings
977	honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right but now it works great the black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing after a few tries i got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played height adjustment was also important if the latch is to high it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up too low and it does not sound right this replaced horrible pulse hi hat hardware that shook loose every few songs so i am completely pleased with it definitely worth bought one tried it on a p bass loved it returned to amazon and bought an additional one for a jazz bass love it good product for a good price very comfortable update i just ordered my rd one of these this time for another p bass i picked up the only gripe i can think of and it s being super picky is as another review mentioned the strap s padding design doesn t really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position if you re a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap other than that this is a killer product for a killer price my guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings they sound wonderful and cost very little what s not to love does exactly what you want it to do it even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand it s easy to set up and easy to take down if you re looking for a mic stand buy this one you really can t go wrong i have always loved hercules products their mic stands and guitar stands they are great quality and very handy especially this one for performances where guitars are used the stand is very well constructed and very stable the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders i was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder but then again all guitar stores display their guitars with them so i thought lets have a go i m glad i did my stand doesn t tip over like the others you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out the fingers in front hold the instrument in lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument i can t believe i never thought of buying colored cables before i often move all my microphones from one drum set to another depending on what i m recording and now i don t have to use masking tape and write what each microphone is for i can just look at the color and i m all set can t say much more than the description it s a cheap box that works nothing fancy and not for everyone if you just need a box that is cheap this is it
978	just barely gets the job done i have a fender jazz bass standard the shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing it is very low quality not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly its just good enough but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open i would be constantly worried about it falling over i will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future a great set of bass strings with all the right features perfect balance of bright punch and warmth right deep tones great feel and playability stable tuning textured round design with hexagonal core shape durable easy to stringmy father uses d addario on his telecaster and acoustic guitars which originally prompted me to choose d addario for my fender jazz bass i can say that the brands reputation carries over to bass these are phenomenal strings
979	i ve been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands as i m rather petite luckily for me we found one of these secondhand it needed minimal repairs and it s just great i don t know anything about purchasing it new but i can tell you that this is a great beginner s instrument for someone who has small hands i ll also note that it s even affordable while it s brand new the notes are surprisingly clean sounding coming from a guitar that s so low priced i d definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument exactly what i needed small compact functional and it works no off on power switch though but small consideration when you think about what it can do connect mics ipods mp players and control sound and volume at your fingertips this is a very nice cable i like this one better than all the other ones that i own its thick and the sound is great then one day an amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off that stunk
980	i ve tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last years and i ve settled on d addarios for all my guitars their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency the price is right they re color coded to make string changing easier and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more the s are my choice for rock and blues at first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth but these one s really get the guitars shining up really nice they are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone i can not comment on this as i have never owned or played one what i can say with over years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low price i own this pedal the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion see my other reviews on these pedals basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween it is built solidly and looks roadworthy it has reasonably decent components and it sounds great is it of the same caliber as a boutique pedal no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price i would have no issue gigging with this unit the distortion is warm with the tone at with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available lots of sounds in this unit and very very quiet nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned for classic rock this is perfect maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatoverall no concerns with this great product great value
981	these strings are very bright and full they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead i haven t had any problems with breakage just a loss of tone over time seems faster than some other strings i ve tried i love d adarrio strings great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers d adarrio strings rule see ya if you want an inexpensive pure nickel string get thedr strings pure blues pure nickel wrap round core they feel nice are nicer to your frets sound smooth and mellow for the blues or any genre they bendnicely and sustain just as well i know guitar strings can be a personal thing and there are more expensive pure nickels out there butat this price point try a set of these as well you may be surprised i have rated this set at stars because only after about hours of practice the d string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my gibson standard no damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull almost dead strange i recently went electric again after years so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again that said i never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over years of playing i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else maybe its no big deal so no one remarks on it update i am still using dr blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthem update i just had the d string windings break on a new set different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above works well easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers i ve had unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints dust oxidation squeaks or gummy areas or drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars this is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new i don t like greasy feeling products on my guitars so dr duck ax wax is designed for my needs i threw out my gibson spray too oily dr ducks wax is worth the extra this bottle will last a lifetime you could use it on your johnson if you wack off the finish
982	the reverb broke in my amp and i tried the boss frv to replace it and didn t really like it too much then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby this is exactly what i wanted it fills out the sound and yet doesn t add any artificial high end sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement for most songs it s always on and it really excels at vintagy sounding stuff like rockabilly and surf the mod button is a nice add on but i haven t really bonded with it yet if i had to buy this over again i might consider the aqua puss because i don t use the high delay times all that much and the aqua puss has an easy access battery door simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician three big ones are the jet sound choral flange and leslie speaker pros works really well and is easy to use the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too it is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of quality cons it takes a bit to get accustomed to the timing not lest because the switch is somewhat sticky and requires some extra effort which has an impact on the timing also the led is placed too close to the switch so you tend to cover it up with your foot they should have put it higher up right next to the dial overall impression the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives it s a great and inexpensive looper
983	it s a cable no frills tangles pretty easy and due to it s design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should thank you fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size and thanks to all of you that recommended it for just that reason i bought these strings to replace the strings on my hofner acoustic the gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone i might try a lighter set next time but these have a good clear tone from low to high and are fairly comfortable i ve got three of these to hold an acoustic a mini strat and a jazzmaster while i had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former i was somewhat leary about the later it s quite a bit heavier than the other two but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart i have been trusting it do not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full size electric and i have my doubts about those plugs the hanger will hold but the drywall might not get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument i used a different setup philips slotted round heads would have actually been better to fix them to a nice piece of x x pine and screwed that into the studs with some screws needless to say it s not going anywhere as a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall ok one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a jazzmaster satisfies my needs nice cloth covered large strain relied good plugs put a bit of thread lock on them they unscrew almost unintentionally like it even if it s a bit long for use at home
984	in years of using many jim dunlop products made in america or to his standards of quality i ve never broken or worn out the capo i use mine on both and string guitars the spring tension remains strong after several years which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing the only problem i have with them they seem to disappear when i m not looking i have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use other than smudges from getting the capo dirty it cleans easily i have an older version of this model but it works great i opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that i got from home depot hangers rated to hold up to lbs each equals lbs worth of peace of mind the hanger itself that i bought was used so it was already assembled so i can t comment too much on the assembly process i bought of them and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry free security and no i don t own stock in the company these are good i dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range they all work well length of being brillant is somewhat limits but it appears to be in most of these level of strings i am completely blown away with these headphones the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic
985	this dual splitter works perfect i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings the most important part of video is the audio you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal i always say half of video is audio for years i used to run a line directly out of the dj s mixer to get my audio the issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking often though the signal is to hot the music is crap or the dj says something stupid with just the dj s voice i can edit the way i want and compress time this product has improved my productions beyond it s price sold i use them to run a separate clean audio line from a dj s wireless systems to my own audio recorder they work perfectly and haven t failed me once it works well hasn t broken down despite much abuse and can easily be cleaned now if only all windscreen s were this sturdy i d be a happy customer these nandy mics are great entry level mics if you are looking not spend to much cash they have a long range and great sound fidelity if you are trying to save on your budget these are great if money is not an option keep on looking these are made solid and are very stable i knocked it to stars because they don t match up the holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky
986	excellent i love this company d addario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time ever since i switched to this brand of strings they seem to last longer and make a grab tone i don t know if it s my guitar taylor ce or the strings but i can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use i definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar this is a great music stand i like how it s adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in it s very sturdy and well built i don t ever worry that it ll tip over i love it i would recommend it i ve been using these for years tried others but i prefer these i d allways come back to d addario s they just sound good i m satisfied these cables are awesome they do what they are suppose to do and do it well i personally like that they are smaller in the middle and are easier to fold than regular cable if you are looking to connect your pedals and dont want to break your wallet look no farther than hosa inch cable sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a tusq this should improve my sustain and tone even more if you re looking for a budget increase of tone this is a way to go i had been leery about leaving my fender string custom jazz bass on guitar stands until i met the hercules gs b the stand is built like a tank with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly my bass weighs about pounds with the strap and with its long neck fits perfectly in the hercules with the body of the bass resting well balanced against the padded legs the design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and i experimented with trying to tip the bass over it will take more than an accident to tip the bass off its stand the self closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism i would have preferred the stand being a more conservative all black sweet twangy sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars i have a ceramic and this steel slide each has a unique sound the steel as expected has more of brighter twang when i change my strings i know that i ll get some differences in tonal quality but hey experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys great picks this thing is awesome i hate refilling humidifiers and this thing is just leave it and forget it it has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar and one that restsin the case up by the headstock i ve been playing for about years and have always used a humidifier this works just as good as anything else keeps my case at a nice humidity i would recommend a nice hygrometer to keep in the case too just to make sure you have the proper humidity level update so being the lazy guy that i am i never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hard well i noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water these really are a humidity system rather than just a humidifier they are almost completely back to their normal state being very gel like feeling so i am convinced that they work now this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together using just one wall wart you can power all of them at least those that receive this kind of power v where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l converter cl for line products i have an m audio black box which had a peculiar size plug it was v ma but nothing would fit then i tried the l converter and bingo i m in business and black box bliss i would recommend having it around just for that it costs about the same as odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can t find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters a pedal junkies salvation i got this duet instead of the single light version as most kindle users do so far i really like it cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read even better than day light the only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflection the ac adapter is a great money saver as i usually read hours at night and burning up aaa batteries each night is not really a solution if you have a kindle dx i would strongly recommend this duet instead of the single light version cuz there s almost twice as much screen to cover of course i also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the kindle it s a versatile light source and i really like it a lot nice bright light i have the might bright twin lights and have used them for about years as with many things i m a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music this light comes in a very nice soft case though they call it a bag that holds everything the switch is conveniently located on top of the light the clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move unlike my twin lights the use of the device was moderately difficult the primary difficulty was in the how the user s manual was written the information is not straight forth and the how to especially on setting up the device was severely lacking this left me to the old plug and chug method once i figured out how to set it up i found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker the dr did sound better with ear buds but still was short of what i expected based on the reviews on amazon and other websites the good things though is that it is light portable and the mics can be moved i wasn t expecting bose type of sound but i wasn t expecting to hear the tin man either when this little plastic gizmo arrived i admit i had low expectations for it at first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and i figured the plastic would soon break i really did not expect much accuracy in tuning either i have used this for a couple of months now switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well i may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner it works as well as my expensive model i was using and i don t have to stick it on the guitar body worth checking out these patch cords work like a champ i use them with my pedal board and haven t any issues with signal quality they give some versatility in their length i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much the colors well ok they re a little odd but for the price i dealt with it i payed the for this just because the tuner i have was so slow to respond i needed something new the response time on this is like half a second and it s super simple to use keep in mind that the snark website sells this tuner for so the cost here is definitely worth it i ve been playing guitar and using capos for years i ve learned this if you are a serious guitar player there are many must have items you need in your arsenal one of them is a capo by clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device they are quite common inexpensive and the basic design really hasn t changed in many years until now that s where this product comes in this capo is great because it doesn t simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down it has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob the reason this matters is because depending on the guitar sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension or not enough when clamped too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes either one is not good this new capo eliminates that in an efficient effective and economical manner i highly recommend i own several capos but this is the first with an adjustable tension several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck i picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the ns artist there wasn t a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when i compared the capos but when i compared them from the th fret on there was some slight noticeable differences granted i had to readjust the tension on the ns artist why readjust the neck s character changes slightly as you get nearer the body and to ensure that i had just enough and not too much tension after all that s why it s adjustable i readjusted the tension the tonal differences were more noticeable when i played softly and less when i cranked down all in all not a bad capo great strings with a good feel to them they are size which is just right for my electric guitars i won t know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey if they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and i will switch if they last a long time i don t think of these as extra lights they are more of a light to me great product with nice feel and tone i m only sorry i pre ordered only two sets at the average price now is and over i ll bite the bullet and order more after i wear these two sets out hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time i need new strings these are durable and long lasting recommeded i ve been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while but i was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i ve been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller i was intrigued by the promise of long life though i have a taylor big baby that i bought used and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didn t sound at all like old strings this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new i d just changed the strings on my s gibson gospel a week ago so i decided that would be my reference the nanowebs went on my s guild d both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars the gospel is a bit brighter sounding but i m pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars if they d sounded dull i d notice as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled light gauge they had a e string something you d be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings the b was a compared to the of the d addarios i usually play the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges turns out that these are hd light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end the difference shouldn t be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d so how do they sound the unwound e and b don t sound different from any other plain steel string of course the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer when i switch between the d and the gospel sound wise i d say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day i wouldn t call them dull by any stretch of the imagination if i didn t know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn t be able to tell from playing them so they re good sounding strings and they last a long time that leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings here s the way i see it if you re a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not you re probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination but if you re a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run and if you re a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice for myself i m going to leave these on the d for as long as they still sound good i ll update this review when i find out just how long they do last follow up after playing these for a few days i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars they sound great on the loar and now i have two guitars to do a long term test

987	bought this to hook up a beta to a panasonic g dslr and a kodak zi for interviews works the way it s supposed to degree trs is a nice touch good price works just as it should love it and a great price to boot these cable are perfect i ve bought much more expensive cable that didn t have the quality of these they even had velcro re useable tape to hold them each i am president of the international press association a global organization of photographers videographers and journalists we have been teaching our members to convert from shooting stills to videos on their dslr cameras i needed this cord and a shorter one for an important assignment on a cruise ship and these guys came through in time for me to use both cords you can see them in use at our online publication impress in this article and video thanks guys will be shopping with you again i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m mic or similar i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot but i opened one tried to use it and can t it was a total waste of money but doesn t pay to return it i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it it might serve your purpose again you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands
988	these are okay strings for the folk guitar nothing special but the price isn t out of the world either good buy for the money tried them on a gibson j and they seem to do good i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks they are so grippy i haven t broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so it s hard to loose them but i still do if you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while you re playing they are a little thin for rhythm playing however and i recommend the mm picks for that perfect size for us big guys i do recommend some snap locks for it though i use mediums but bought these for my nephews takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar always love these strings this kid has not changed his strings in years so i thought i would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible this strap looks really great and fits just as advertised it s just that it gets in the way for me and my chording skills mounted as designed and shown i altered the mounting manner to accomodate my style and it functions fine looks great too high quality and compliments the martin name and reputation really well i feel that it s a good deal and recommend it these strings fit the bill perfectly for my desired sound from a yamaha lj acoustic guitar which has been doctored with bone saddle pins and nut when i decided to put the money into the guitar it was my belief that the elixir strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that i like so much in the lj and after all the work was completed that proved to be true to form i did move to the medium for a little improvement from the bass side and it s a most outstanding sound from a medium price hand crafted guitar elixir has the best most comfortable feel to me of all the strings that i ve tested and these provide the best for my liking sound on this guitar try them if it s quality sound that you re looking for these are great this is a very high quality slide and really serves the purpose very well try one i think that you will love it if that s what you re looking for this had to be designed by someone who understood the need for well placed lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light just right over two open pages the battery operation is nice if you want to be portable but i have found that the ac adapter mine came with the light check to be sure you get one with yours is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day my duracell batteries ran down quickly over a few weeks before i noticed the light becoming slightly less and less the ac adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness the whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of i needed to buy an extension cord as the ac adapter cord is only about feet long and while that sounds like a lot by the time you lay it out where you want it out of the way to avoid tripping you might need to add an extension cord too i understand the led s themselves last a long long time so that is good they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there all in all these do the job illuminating with a pleasant easy to read by light i ve been playing guitar for over years and been through many different style of tuners this is by far the best i ve ever had not only is it accurate and easy to use but it s so convenient simply clip it to the head of the guitar press the only button on the unit and start tuning also unlike other tuners i ve used this tuner does a great job of filtering ignoring ambient noise in the room i can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation even with the tv on in the room pro s vibrant easy to read display no need for cords chargers even when used on electric guitars bass simple one button activation lightweight i leave it on my classical guitar all the time especially after restringing auto shutoff also can manually shut it off just press the one button a second time works for guitar and bass both acoustic and electric and violin also works on my ukulele con s wish i had this years ago bottom line this is a no brainer the price quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist
989	i built a cbg recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites the sound i get from the ad g strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp the strings seem to hold up well i cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle these strings sound great i was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing has a good sound stays in tune wish it came in a darker grain of wood a little bulky my arm goes to sleep sometimes after extended playing wish it was a little thiner i bought it because i wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price you get what you pay for this is a no nonsense cheap guitar stand its adjustable padded and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you a stage groupie or your clumsy drummer trip on it the whole mess falls over this is perfect for your fender starcaster or screaming pink hello kitty guitar this is not a good choice for your prized jimi hendrix strat or eric clapton gibson es you might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those crikey where to begin firstly i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet secondly they mismarked one of the packets so it appeared i had two d strings instead of two e strings lastly and certainly the least favorably once tuned up the strings sounded terrible they were tinny and clangy sounding i ve never heard worse strings fortunately i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med light as well i replaced the godawful martins with the ernie ball s and they were far far better shame on martin for such a piss poor product i ll never buy their strings again i was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent i have a seagull s dreadnought and it fits in this bag like a glove the zippers are also very high quality and this bag will last a long time another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor i had to travel in some very cold weather to a friends home and i fully expected to have to retune my guitar not so it was still in tune and the cold had no effect during transport due to the insulation of this bag
990	now a days i just search amazon because they have always got what i want at reasonable prices this is no exception i am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my epiphone les paul custom pro to the guitar guy for setup etc this was was better then i expected it is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit in other words great all around i know it sits on a self with many other guitars when i take it in to the guitar guys so i am perfectly confident that it is well protected and it is lockable with key if you are looking for a more then good case for your epi lp just get this one you will not be disappointed also i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day no special shipping maybe it is my locations but that was great too well packed it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp probablly not much use being only five feet in length for a gig or show but since i am only rocking out in my house it s no big deal i initially had a black colored one because i thought that would be more cool but i lost it so now i get brighter colored ones gripe a rubber thingy on the bottom of the clip came off while performing and i have not been able to find it it still works but that s a design flaw also don t leave it attached to any fine guitar because it like capos can permanently damage the finish of a really fine guitar but it works well and the batteries seem to last
991	got this to use with the behringer compressor i ordered with this they are not indicated as compatible but it worked great price was right i already own two and had no problems quiet no hummmmm buy it if you need a wall wart the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d slap echo effects pedal works great and gives me that old tube amp reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit there s no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great it was not what i wanted when a person has a low income we can not afford what we can not use i was looking for what is called shimmer most reverbs do not have shimmer as the rv because digitech called shimmer string swell and volume swell is linked to the violin sound it cost me its called slow motion for a reason because it has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear it is with over drive being played on the high strings it might be good for playing with a bow i have no idea because i can not afford a bow the reason i bought this pedal was for the space setting which is essentially a shimmering organ octave up effect on the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking and it can get crowded with chords but it does sound ethereal and choir y features time controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals decay controls the length of the reverberations tone controls the color of the reverb and mix controls the level of wet to dry it can basically cut all the dry signal if desired the trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off however if your mix is set to max wet signal no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off i haven t really been able to use it effectively so i just leave trails off dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument sounds the classic reverb sounds spring plate room chamber aren t very distinct from one another the hall setting is bit more expansive the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note removing excess reverb for the latest notes chords played the cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delay cons the blue led is very bright as on all behringer pedals i just cover it up with a sticker and it still shows through the foot switch is digital so it doesn t preserve state and doesn t have the best assuring click because it is buffered bypass the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it even when off the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch and then lift upalso almost of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate which can be removed but that makes the pedal almost toy like in weight behringer usually makes good stuff and this reverb is no different but what it does best is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb nothing else i wanted this for singing and i have the danelectro fab echo which gives a short distance echo but i wanted something without the slap back and this does what i want it for but not quite as much depth as i wanted but with the music i do not think anyone can tell if you want a good reverb that is above average with much depth then get the behringer rv not this the power supply i use is danelectro which is great i also have a godlyke that i use
992	this design is a big improvement over string swings past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch i will buy more if i get another guitar i got tired of flying with my guitar everytime i go visit my parents besides the risk to my guitar there is the cost for the price i paid for this guitar i will be money ahead in two visits to my parents i had it shipped to my parents when i bought it and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits it has much better tone than i expected and very good action stays in tune very well i am very happy with my purchase recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party this is great for those who already own strap locks and just want to gear up the rest of your collection no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use the price was ok thsese are the perfect size for my jazzmaster too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly maybe my hands are just sweaty
993	a little history i have been a guitar player for forty odd some of them very odd years for the first thirty of them i tuned by ear starting by guessing at what a low e sounded like then tuning the other five strings by fretting listening and tuning i could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord yet remained off for others it took quite a long time to get it right then about ten years ago i thought i had figured it out the problem i thought was that my guesses at a true e were off so i got myself an e tuning fork cycles and used it to tune the first string then i did as i had always done fretted and tuned the other five not much better as a result kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right during those years i tried tuning all six strings to what i believed was an accurately tuned piano as well as by ear to tones available online nothing gave me better tuning on the first try then i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck the realization there have been many each of which has led me closer to what i have now near perfect tuning on the first go round first off i realized that when we say e that is not just one note it is a range of literally hundreds perhaps even thousands of specific tones the same is true for every note this is akin i guess to the realization as a child that no matter how many shades of blue are in a box of crayons the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare purchasing my first chromatic tuner a ct manufactured by switchmucic and sold through musiciansfriend com moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning however that tuner had at least two limitations firstly it s construction is rather light and flimsy it works ok but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the korg for about the same price that is that the korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you both tuners have plug in for electric instruments and so far as i can tell their accuracies are similar i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned additionally the korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs and remembers the original tuning tones so you can return to it for more standard usage a nice extra piece of flexibility the lcd meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you right away whether you are sharp flat and by how much or right on as a point of surprising interest the tuning fork i had used for years turns out to be profoundly flat a shock to me given that i had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones i have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be i guess the round pitch pipe that ms sweeny used to tune up the class in the th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed and finally this is a marvelous little and inexpensive device well constructed accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances i assume that there will be still higher places for my learning curve in this area to rise to but for right now this is it i am using it regularly on all my stringed instruments two six string martins a twelve string epiphone and a frailing banjo the time it saves tuning the string alone makes it more than it s own price if you have not discovered chromatic tuning maybe i really was the last one to discover these things i suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds really right perhaps people with perfect pitch can do very nicely without a chromatic tuner i am not one of them are you these strings aren t anything fancy but they sound great a good old standard that i ve used since i was a kid and this is the best price i ve found this guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble i have no complaints about this stand at all other reviews give an adequate overview of the kit and its potential so i ll just mention particular details the kick pedal spring tension was set too tight making the pedal hard to control and very frustrating to a beginner fortunately the thumbscrew and nut adjustment is easy and made a tremendous improvement in feel and control the documentation is poor and inexcusably there s nothing better available online from alesis the steps in the graphical setup page are less than ideal for a single person assembly the kit allows for tremendous flexibility in positioning the pads horizontally and vertically yet you re pretty much left on your own to discover this experienced drummers will know what they want but i would have appreciated a suggested basic setup showing common variations the control module s buttons and operation are described but there s no detailed guide to the preset kits or selectable pad patches you ll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes there seems to be an ongoing controversy over a firmware update to the controller module whether it fixes an issue with the snare drum pad responsiveness when struck simultaneously with the hi hat or is in fact the cause of an issue with the pad i ve noticed no such problem and as of this date alesis has no such update on their site which leads me to suspect their former patch may have been bad and or they ve updated units currently being sold speaking of the snare the second outer zone for rimshots is nice but i can only get it to trigger while sticking from the outside the technique of laying the stick flat across the head and lifting one end doesn t seem to trigger the rimshot or perhaps i just haven t worked out the touch yet i m interested in a natural sound probably close to a classic jazz kit and a couple of the presets work for me i also have battery and using the kit to trigger those samples opens up vast possibilities still most of the time i just want to sit down and play and don t want to bother firing up the pc and loading software so it s nice to have two workable options the headphone volume could be louder but running it into powered speakers and taking a headphone out from them solves that issue keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lint free cloths dampen one with a little warm water wring it out well and use a light circular motion to remove dust and dirt then wipe gently with the dry cloth to take up any residue this is my first experience with an electronic kit and as others have mentioned the sensation really is fundamentally different from an acoustic instrument particularly when striking the cymbal pads it takes awhile to mentally balance the soft thud or click depending on which surface you strike from outside the headphones with the sampled drum sound within i wasn t sure i liked it for the first couple of weeks meaning i probably didn t but i ve gotten used to it and have gradually begun to relate to the dm on its own terms not as an imitation of an acoustic drum kit but as something else with its own special characteristics
994	i ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use very secure the best i ve used so far sorry but i m not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers it s okay good size works pretty well but sheds when new and despite claims of being laundry safe the edges began to unravel after the first wash i used with planet waves restore polish and got good results but probably would not buy again i chose this rating because i found this product superior to other similar products i have purchased in the past this is hands down the most comfortable strap i own i am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but i use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model worth the wait this miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing just remember to turn it off or the display will prove distracting during winter when a guitar or mandolin moves with changes in humidity staying in tune is an issue even for expensive instruments this little device helps the player deal with the problem without constant recourse to a larger tuner i own at least of these i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too
995	these are excellent strings for the price and i will buy them again martin is a name that means quality this is a well assembled and packaged unit designed to a price so certain compromises have been necessary compromises such as a single supply wall wart partly an advantage to get the ac out of the amplifier itself and very basic circuit with inexpensive parts the preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges and has no provision for load adjustments or the like on the other hand it works well is packaged nicely and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy but want a basic phono riaa amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs also by avoiding the ldquo all in one rdquo tendency of units that include inexpensive d a converters and such for usb output this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog only uses for which it is suited the unit is also very ldquo hackable rdquo if you d like to upgrade things like capacitors resistors or the opamps or use a nicer external power supply the first thing i d upgrade lastly if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge and the capacitance of your phono cables you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly recommended if your budget is limited awesome patch cables for your pedalboard they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks love planet waves gear it works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up it eats batteries like nothing this size i have ever seen the swivel ball socket broke and i had to glue the arm into the remaining socket hmmm very nice cable but the white ends which are nice looking could be a little shorter it works awesomely and it s not a bad price for name brand cables
996	these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar i don t like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups etc big disappointment i m getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem back to the drawing board i go i love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop it has two brightness settings illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly
997	i am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up dial it in and play it for a while i edited yet again as someone didn t appreciate my gloating over other guitars i own sorry to offend you i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this but in all fairness i received my gibson les paul on the same day buying it from my local music store and professionally set up ready to go i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak but now even after comparing them to each other they really aren t that far apart the gibson is the best guitar i ve ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it but this little baby is now my second favorite my other review was not fair i paid a lot more for the gibson and bucks for this epiphone dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal wow i must honestly admit the edge goes to my gibson but not by as much as you d think this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price if i were to play them each blindfolded i would never guess one was guitar ever the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul it s easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound i can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock to be honest i will probably play this epiphone a lot more than the gibson after all if i ding this one up i haven t broke the bank i think i ll tend to use this one a lot more than the other i am very happy with this epiphone les paul and will proudly play and own it i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge i may purchase another one and put it away as i m sure the price won t stay this low plus i ll get another one in a different color you can never have too many guitars i am going to an a pickguard to this one the finish on it is outstanding and i d like to keep it that way if i were thinking of learning to play the guitar this one is a no brainer buy it if you re an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar i d buy this one is a heartbeat i was shocked at how sweet it sounds how good it looks how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is fantastic new rule for me no writing reviews until i own the product for at least one week this is a great music stand i like how it s adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in it s very sturdy and well built i don t ever worry that it ll tip over i love it i would recommend it this tuner is easy to use i have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn t seem to be perfect on pitch this tuner is and i am very happy with this purchase
998	ive been using this polish since the early s it doesn t smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars what has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them but this polish no way martin knows what they re doing i use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes they re very thin nylon picks they re good for practicing the hand motions of strumming they put up very little resistance so they train you to keep your hand stable i still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone but i usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums i also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don t notice with a thicker pick they re great for what they are thin flexible picks and amazon has the best price these picks are nice and thin just what i was looking for in a pick they seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down i m satisfied with these picks these strings sound great play great and the coating really does keep down the squeaking some purists don t like the coating movement when it comes to strings and it does take a micron off the treble but they last a loooong time i usually only have to change my strings once a month i use them on my washburn acoustic guitar and play rock folk and country strumming they rock and i feel they are the best strings around today period these strings are very small and are great for playing for long periods of time without brutalizing the fingertips some people say the real light strings are not good for recording and you probably have less of a bass boom but i like em do not use these to polish your guitar it leaves tons of small fibers all over and is hard to clean up a total disaster these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop but not cleaning anything i usually use extra lights because my fingers are wimps i like the bottom e to go down to a small i have heard though that you get more oomph bass and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings so i decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead also i finally bought my first martin woo hoo and researched strings for it and i read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the light mediums were a happy medium and a good balance when i got my martin d m i cleaned it up and then restrung it with a set of these light mediums at first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast but that is because i am adding width to the e string to ouch i just have to build up my callouses which will take a few weeks of torture ugh but the sound is awesome part of it is the martin guitar of course but these strings when i hit the g chord ring out with a deep warm and long sustaining bass thump you feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings the th th and th the treble strings bend pretty easily no buzzing they have no coating so they squeak like hell tip i put a molecule or of hand lotion on my fingertips minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down these strings are great i recommend them i will try and update my review months from now and let you know about their longevity etc this is a pretty cool product i have mine next to my computer because i am constantly waiting on video to render and i am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand it is also good to have when i am using garage band and need to set the guitar down for a second if you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it won t work the guitar wobbles and falls out but it works great on carpet the pick bucket is a nice touch keeps picks from scattering all over my desk the rubber is very grippy to my wood desk and never moves i would recommend this simple effective just what i wanted seems a tad flimsy but time will tell tuning couldn t be easier neat product
999	this case is the best i ve ever had very plush on the inside and hard construction on outside is very strong the handle extreamly soft to the touch i guess all my other cases just don t measure up to this one it even locks if your guitar fits but this for the quality this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power its easy to install and keeps things simple no more extra messy cabling glad i got it thanks to amazon for the quick delivery i own a fender reverb reissue and i had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very very difficult to find however i bought this jj electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until i had enough money to afford a higher end tube and this blew me away i was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it in fact i think i will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it s almost dead before i purchase another tube this daisy chain worked very well for me no problems yet i m powering about six pedals currently and i am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound i think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank and it should work with any single spot a c adapter you might already have so no need to buy another this unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay it s not so digital and bright delay like boss dd or dd mod switch adds a perfect chorus effect for s metal ballads sound i can put electric guitars in gig bags on this stand it is solid and no problems with itafter months use assembly was pretty easy and took little time
1000	its a great pedal sound really crunchy i got a peavy vyper sometime i use this if i want a crunchy style but the amp i got is really good and has its own distortion styles i use the heavy metal config on this pedal i recomend it to anyone does not introduce noise i run it on the stock battery it still works you can make your guitar sound like metallica or megadeth of course it also depends on a lot of things like pickups amp etc i also have a very old little peavey practice amp this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life listen to it on the boss website i heard to it and then i thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them but it does sound really really close regards forgive my english not from the u s i used this to replace a pot in my mim telecaster works great i didn t notice any change in tone it just worked like the old one but the main this is that it worked and my tele sounds as great as it always did i have not tested other micro amps this does for what i bought it for to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport it s very portable to take with you i really like the overdrive sound the tuner works really well i dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel but overall its a great product so if you need a good tone and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try it s great yeah i kind of bought it on a whim it s confusing as hell first of all i don t really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described this pedal has tone its very easy to use and program i did not have idea on how to use it and really quick i got it it has a great interface it sounds great you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no time the distrosion is great some people say they arent but i really love them its a matter of taste and creating your tones some preset may not be good for youthe downside it does not have the ac adapter but i knew this the lights under certain light conditions are very bright but this pedal is note heavy well constructed and sturdy i got the ac adapter so i dont have to be on the batteries all the time this pedal has the whole package effects great tone great distorsion and cleans
1001	this hosa cable is very well made with good quality connectors and a nice long length my son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected this cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable highly recommended cfh it does what its supposed to i really like that the bottom is adjustable and gets the guitar higher or lower off the floor as needed a great price and a good item i ve tried the fishman ft and the tune tech ttm i like this one the best it seems as accurate as my other tuners like all clip on tuners there are sweet spots on the head that work better than others oddly the snark likes different spots from the fishman or tune tech i tested the snark against them my korg tuner and my android app tuner the snark was fine the biggest plus i see on the snark and the reason its my new go to tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen my vision isn t so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful i don t have to guess or squint it has a metronome which can be fun i personally don t use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so i don t want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when i really need it the only minus that i can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce i don t have a custom made brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing if you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you ll trust it if not then the fishman is more your speed i hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good i haven t had much chance to play it but so far so good it seems like it is good quality not knowing much and after using for a couple of months i m pretty happy with guitar for the money i paid for it fit and finish is quite nice just needed tuning great beginner model feels solid and stay s in tune after the first or practice sessions
1002	i have one gig bag already not like this fender and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar i bought this fender is lots better then my other bag my other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this fender bag the finder s padding is a bit better than my other bag also but of course neither is as good as hard case i am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg i need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar because i use crutches and they require my hands the fender s straps are great the left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty wompass and it became difficult for me to carry the straps on this fender stay put love it the guitar i tote in this bag is a martin hd but it can also my blueridge br or my seagull s coastal spruce either of my three acoustic guitars fit the fender gig bag perfectly like i said its a great gig bag if i ever need another i ll be getting another fender gig bag i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people the strap is about too short for my seagull s guitar i will say the build quality is great but too short is and remains too short i will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap i just can t understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short i fired off an email to levy and the long and short of all this is you will have to fork over another to buy an extendo for this strap i don t quite understand why they don t make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another to make it work right in the first place here s a link to the extendo optionlevy s leathers mmgxl brn strap extender http www amazon com levys leathers mmgxl brn strap extender dp b bh n e ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords mmgxl the irony here is i managed to buy the last one for the immediate future this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider i got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now i have this cobbled up looking guitar strap it s sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other i will keep this strap but sure feel like i ve been had on this purchase the terms bait and switch come to my mind i m a guitar piano and bass player as well a private music teacher i also received formal training in guitar building and have been commissioned to build instruments for amateur and professional musicians i ordered this ukelele on the strength of the reviews here at amazon and i was pleased with this instrument when it arrived i was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size it s only about long approximately with nylon strings but it really puts out a strong volume and really nice tone it has geared tuners not peg style tuners that seem to go out of tune easily although i ve never played ukelele i was able to play songs like brown eyed girl old macdonald had a farm and do you wanna dance in about a hour using the chord book that comes with the book i did this drawing on my guitar playing knowledge also my daughter who is a piano player and years old picked up the ukelele in about minutes was able to play row row row your boat which is in the instruction booklet which comes with the uke i see this as a good buy for beginners and a good starter instrument for young children who might like to move over to guitar eventually two concerns though mine came with a couple small dents in the back of the ukelele nothing major but i could see them looks like someone hit it on something also most stringed instruments go out of tune for a short while after you put new strings on them this one wouldn t stay in tune for more than one song when i started playing with it i yanked on the strings to stretch them kept retuning it and playing it and it would still go out of tune this is improving and i m trusting the reviews here that say it goes out of tune at first i m expecting the tuning problem to disappear as the strings get stretched and the windings around the tuners tighten out any slack note two days later after about hours of playing the instrument is staying in tune better and better i expect the problem to correct itself as the string get stretched the little page booklet has basic chords and songs row row row your boat are you sleeping he s got the whole world in his hands twinkle twinkle little star amazing grace and when irish eyes are smiling there was also a blurb about a famous ukelele player who authored the pamphlet on how to play the ukelele and is the founding member of louisville ukelele association unlimited luau a ukelele band overall i m happy with this ukelele and fully expect the tuning problem to go away with use am totally pleased that i did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it works great get one i ve been buying these strings for a while now they sound clean and crisp the best part is the price works right out of the box easy to read easy to use arrived very fast inexcellent shape just had to put the supplied battery into it
1003	my husband got these and they don t get dirty as quickly which is a plus initially the sounds aren t as clear as the uncoated ones but it wears off after a couple of hours of play and you wouldn t know the difference he ll buy them again no difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind i bought these to put on my epiphone sheraton ii i really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer rhythm and lead styles both sound great definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future well i ordered sets of these and sets of medium strings when i got my first banjo as i didn t know what gauge strings i would prefer so far i like the light strings better for clawhammer which is mostly what i play easy on the fingers and sound good to my ears at least not much else to say about strings p would recommend them ok i like this one a lot it stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime it is accurate easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing it sure beats the other units i have used where you clamp on some weird thing tune up and then stash back in your gig bag this one is bing on tune and back to playing it weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up
1004	i bought pedal power in order to use on my latest board build this works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply i would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal it was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables my board looks great works well and i love this power supply i like how with this pedal not only does it not have a heavy click when you press down but if you are playing in a dark room the led lights are nice and bright true bypass i m telling you get it when i made a larger pedal board from plywood to accommodate a new pedal tuner i could not pull the power grip tape from the old board to reuse it the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong works great i m the lead singer in a band and i use an app on my kindle fire as a teleprompter this mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face the mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the kindle fire and mount suffered no damage the mount is easy to remove as well i wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin it sounds pretty good for the price i paid for it i was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic i purchased it at the same time i bought the electric violin naturally when the electric arrived i laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric a few days later i thought i would give the pickup a try it slides right in and out of an f hole with no problem i plugged it into my fender amp with a little reverb and wow is how i can describe what came out it sounded like i was in a great concert hall of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp whatever your amp is capable of your violin can do it now i haven t tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous cant say enough except the price was so low i couldn t have gone wrong too bad
1005	i m now have my music together great for small space does it works limit to one mic but enogh for me i bought this for a friend who always wanted to play violin but never could afford one the quality was surprisingly good considering how cheap it was i helped her set it up took minutes max just needed to get the bridge just right and the only flaw i found was the horrible pegs that came with it i had some spare rosewood ones in a drawer which fixed that small problem as for the rest of the violin the furniture was workmanlike not concert quality but serviceable for a student the body was what really surprised me for a mass produced student model it has a nice sound i do believe that with nicer furniture a better bridge and strings i would not be ashamed to play this at a venue how it will hold up over time is a open question but from what i can see of its internals it is well put together this brings me to my only real problem as she never has played any instrument at all she makes this violin squeal like a pig i am no good at teaching so i got her a few books and downloaded some vids from youtube for her to watch but still her husband has forbidden her to bring the violin home till she can play so she comes over here to practice which has led my neighbors to believe i am responsible for the sudden disappearance of several neighborhood cats i think the noise chased em away i am waiting for the call from the spca as i type this it does not stick on to the guitar very well trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet bought a better pickup
1006	the coversion cable didnt work t is axlr to ubs cable i have the red blinking light syndrome also but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for send it back so izm thanks hde for wasting my time go sell your snake oil to someone else if you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick for a beatles collector what a great price for a neat beatles product even the packaging it cool if you need picks for playing or a neat beatles product to collect you won t be dissipointed with this purchase excellent product from a fantastic seller it is so small that it cannot hold all mics if you have a big lopsided kick drum mic with a skinny neck and akward cog akg d this stand will not be able to hold it up it can however hold up the audix d and it can hold an sm up to a guitar cab if its the right height i love this because it has allowed me to mic things in really really tight spaces i would never have had room to use full sized instrument mic stands in some of the tiny stages i have seen this summer this thing takes up very little real estate i have put this thing in the pocket of my jeans before the hde xlr to usb is ubs i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome i learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for send it back so i did thanks hde for wasting my time go sell your snake oil to someone else i straight out of the box this product reeked cheap no directions inside or on the box i messed with it for about minutes i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic i read the description but it did not say cheap live and learn
1007	this are some great strings i have bought them my last times and i will continue to buy them i like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar the tone is much bettter too good medium picks decent feel and sound would recommend for practice picks pretty decent on noodling girlfriend likes the colors hahaha i should have researched this a little bit more it was a gift for a child but a child couldn t tune this thing nor could i it was a toy not an instrument
1008	its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin came with a few which is nice price was right so why not go for it i highly recommend planet waves cables i have them for my guitars and for my mics awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life cant go wrong this pack rocks they have on off buton the quality feels sturdy and i had it next to shure mics that cost more but sound the same for karaoke vocals i bough two other sets and ft cables these pedals are great a friend of mine said i should buy other pedals because these pedals aren t manufactured by a very known brand name but i went with my own judgement and i was not disappointed with them i have increased my speed a lot since i ve gotten em and i can pedal songs like all nightmare long and beast and the harlot now great pedals but it takes time to develop speed so don t think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can t go all jason costa on em works good good buy works awesome easy install and great price shopped these for awhile and had to get all my guitars off the floor bed corners of room etc installed in two minutes holds neck lightly easy up easy down padded so does not scratch finish on neck will buy again
1009	it does what i need to get my bass and guitar to the amp probablly not much use being only five feet in length for a gig or show but since i am only rocking out in my house it s no big deal item arrived as described and on time way larger than expected but my son loved it says it s easier to use than the smaller cloths we ve gotten before great sounding slider for my electric and it won t shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action it has a great sound for the modern electric guitars but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances i recommend up until a few years ago i had been using the same old brand i d been buying for years then i tried this recipe dunlop it is wonderful it does everything the product description tells you about excellent cleaner on both wood painted and natural and metal i use it to clean not only the body but the tuning heads and bridge on my bass guitar no nasty residue build up over time it cleans and polishes just like it was designed to do without streaking and so on you ll like this stuff better than anything you ve used to date or at least i think so i sure do strings rust very easily yield fairly poor tone and break often though they have the same bending ability as behringer perfect pedalboardi can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb from costa rica i recommend it thanks behringer i have bought of these now for me and a few friends and they work great i am sure they will wear out in time so i have a couple extras but you can t beat them bottom line up front the mxr fullbore metal is a high octane distortion suitable for modern metal music it s band eq with adjustable midrange q gives the mxr fm the ability to model virtually every other distortion out there what i like about the pedal is that it s small easy to operate and doesn t take much time to dial in the tone you want i play with a marshall jcm dsl going into a a x using a les paul standard and it sounds amazing i love the onboard marshall jcm flavored tube distortion but it is more in line with the new wave of british heavy metal obviously and not entirely suitable for modern american metalcore the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go this is nice because i can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel and then tap the fullbore when i need to play metal what i dislike is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise so you have to be careful with the treble and mid q knobs however i also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amp s eq settings as well so know in advance you ll need to spend a good minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposes what about the eh metal muff i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away the big selling point about the mm is that it has a top boost big deal i wrote a review for the mm on amazon but in summary the top boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical comparing the top boost to the noise gate in terms of the big selling point the fullbore s noise gate which has adjustable sensitivity to me seems like a much better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to sound what about the boss me i currently own an me and being totally honest i think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarist s give each other about multi effects is because in their mind they think an old fashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is real whereas multi effects pedals are fake this might be true to some extent but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains that at some point the trade off does indeed make sense fyi dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp as part of his live rig endrant anyway the boss me has only a few settings useful onstage but not so much for recording since in the end they do sound a tad digital and the me compresses your signal the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins for recording purposes i bought this pedal because i wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my metal ep i m self recording in conjunction with an ada gcs i created an all analog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing check out the ada gcs if you can it s an amazing speaker simulator and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was it s own x combo amplifier anyway through the gcs the fullbore basically sounds like a mesa boogie why only stars the fullbore isn t for everybody it isn t for every guitar or every amp but by itself it s really friggin good i suppose if it had a band eq and a ax preamp circuit it would be the best metal pedal but for a small piece of gear it s probably the best analog distortion on the market
1010	i got the ocean turqouise and they are stunning for these beautiful premium quality picks is a steal came with more screws than i needed they were the right size no issues thanks you shouldnt be disappointed with this item i started using the confetti picks years ago when i used to occasionally drop my pick no matter what color the floor carpet stage is you can find your pick easily no lost picks i like the extra heavy picks they suit my playing style well i don t have to wait for it to snap back it doesn t bend they don t break either although they do wear down over time kmc music inc shipped fast and i got free shipping when i buy a gross i only need to buy picks about once every years i would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick thank you kmc music inc for fast shipping not really bright enough both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same i would look for something else if i didn t already have this ok for reading a small book in bed but doesn t cover the sheet music brightly enough
1011	i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite very easy to take it off holds the strings tight what more can you ask for does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive this a very clever idea it helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space very easy to take off put on high recommend this to any stringed instrument players it is really the best pick holder i ever had i can put picks on it it says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb i recommend i bought a rogue mandolin from a friend who bought from amazon but did not have time to even play it for only still brand new never played i have owned and played many other mandolins about a dozen this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills the mandolin is not playable in its brand new state not in tune action too high lower action will result in string buzzes and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup i went thru all the necessary steps almost like a luthier would do and it came out sweet it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation one can find info about mandolin setup on the web it s quite tedious work this will be my beater mandolin at nothing can beat it it stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re tune so this is more than adequate for daily practice often times it even stay in tune the next days i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one the finish on this model has some blemish some small black spots on top the sunburst color but only if you look really close i would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred at less than no problem at all of course this mandolin is no match for more expensive models brands such as kentucky but i gave it a stars based on its high performance cost ratio if you don t know how to setup mandolin then be prepared to pay to for a professional setup which is a must otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge that s unfair all brand new mandolins require setup at this expense unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it if you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do
1012	these picks are nylon so each one will last you a couple of years as long as you don t lose them this is thicker than the mm so you can dig into the strings a little better but still a hair flimsier than the snarling dogs mm picks i know they re the same size but trust me these are flimsier and the grip is ok you can t go wrong here i really did not expect much from this rag i just wanted a good quality lint free scratch free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use i was totally surprised that it actually works this good removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too you may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag this thing rocks it picks up every smudge smear print and leaves nothing behind it s an amazing little cleaning tool and i will replace it if when it ever wears out if you are like me and you want your instruments to look clean grunge free onstage you should check out this little wonder you can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want doesn t get any easier great product a note about the mixed reviews i really wish amazon would separate the different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page it really isn t fair to the actual good product to have it s rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a completely different item it also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want when i go to the product page for the amazingly good micro fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint it makes me sad i have had both of the other items and this micro fiber cloth is nothing like the other this item has sewn seamed edges that will not fray it never leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there my guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth and i use the thing almost every day i got on this rant bc i came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it i told him i would just get another then i came here and couldn t remember which version i bought and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item leaves behind lint what the crap are they talking about turns out they are talking about a completely different item i looked up my purchase history and found i had bought the micro fiber then i placed an order for more for me to give away again putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course putting an apple and a lemon on the same page literally and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed at least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones you know what version to buy and which to avoid anyway end rant i bought this sustain pedal for my irig keys midi controller i had an on stage pedal square but that was crap this m audio is awesome it doesn t move from where i put it on the floor it sustains the note how it supossed to and it feels very well so far it s still working and it has a switch button to use with any keyboard i would buy it again bought these to plug into practice bass amp wifey a little nasty when i get itch to play at am i play string and i could not believe the deep sound i get out of these especially in this price range highly recommend works well easy to install and take out helps greatly to control acoustic feedback i ve looked at these for a while glad i purchased it nice to see something well made for a change most guitar straps i see that are less than are all cheap and that fake stuff i can see this strap lasting a long time i love how i don t need new strap buttons considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor you can lock each strap button with one hand great product i love the small size of this tuner and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly the tuner picks up vibrations so it doesn t require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar there s just one button so it s idiot proof however the button can get pushed to easily so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case running the battery out too soon speaking of battery the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery but i hate that they used the cr battery it just doesn t last long and in brazil it s really hard to find this battery at all
1013	not easy to set up hard to tighten down works well enough as a filter once you get it placed i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano i have a pro model with xlr outs to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces works every time balanced signal is so much better no more issues with ground loops or other problems just clear as a bell they were cheap and the build quality is fine after years this microphone has lasted me a very long time and has stayed a fantastic microphone as i am getting more serious with voice over i am moving to better equipment but as a starter microphone microphone in general it deserves a nod of approval definitely a fantastic purchase very happy with it for me being a solo string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface i cannot say i am wild about the included software which is ableton live lite i really disliked the screen views of ableton and thought they were hard to view so i did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested mixcraft wow i like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork mixcraft is so user friendly and you don t have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time and shouldn t recording be fun and not frustrating besides the focusrite interface recognized mixcraft as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper this in my opinion is one of the best entry level recording audio interface units around it also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface engineered in england and on the downside made in china isn t everything these days
1014	perfect for re stringing your guitar very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings the price was right too this is a must have tool and isn t cheap like most of the plastic ones out there the nice thing about this one is it cuts off excess with ease just looks better trimmed neatly star product when i bought my first guitar about months ago i just chose a pack of picks on amazon s list of other buyers also bought this and those were these fender picks at the time i figured all picks were created equal since then i ve tried various sizes and brands dunlop planet waves etc but i keep coming back to this fender medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitar the sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly the planet waves picks all seem to be a little muddy sounding i ve found a winner with these fender picks and will definitely be ordering more to be clear i am quite the newbie guitar player after i managed to break a string on my electric guitar i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself as most guitarists do things went alright but on trying to tune the thinnest string it broke i just figured it was something i did and wasn t the products fault so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine overall i ve played quite abit with these strings and have yet to break another one pretty good sound quality and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture resistant package to prevent corrosion strong and won t tip price is very affordable i own several and have had no trouble with them buy it and you will see very good guitar strap thick nylon webbing material well sewn and the leather ends not only look sharp they hold really well on your guitar studs the tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar i would recommend this strap to all a good tool for study and applying to your music keep on hand to help understand theory also great for those starting out learning an instrument
1015	i love this pop filter it is every to attactch and doesn t scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do the adjustable arm is very flexible yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement with a nice clean crisp sound inexpensive price and durable history i ve made these strings apart of my acoustic set i ve got at least spares at home right now xd great item sturdy had it for a few weeks now small light durable holds the strings down perfectly too great capo i ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount it seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on it s especially effective when the microphone is on my desk where my computer tower which has fans is directly under it it s not perfect but the level of noise reduction really is amazing on top of all that it looks nice too if you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk you should definitely consider getting this along with a solid stand and a pop filter i am absolutely delighted with this tunner one comment my son has one also the neck of his broke so he warned me i am always very careful when turning the head i can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen as far as tuning goes i am very pleased i moved from a guitar to a harp so i am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful plus my vision is not the best and this one i can really see
1016	i am mostly happy with this amp it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs with that said when i was shopping around for an amp both online and in person all the amps i tried and read about both very expensive and very cheap amps had one characteristic in common which is missing from this one and which i thought was universal it doesn t allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing i had to purchase a headphone amp separately wasn t expecting that this may seem a nit pick but considering the universality of this feature you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp other than that this is a great amp i could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it sound quality the bx sounds neutral and balanced compared to similar sized consumer speakers they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs i e teen eq the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours it also lacks a midrange bump and sounds a bit recessed or laid back compared to average earbuds or home speakers in fact the bx sounds similar to my sennheiser hd headphones but with less lower bass and that s a good thing for mixing as you don t want speakers that add color and or bumps in the frequency response unlike typical passive stereo speakers the bx is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer i e bi amped this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver the downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing at first the bx struck me as underpowered for a watt rating at least with a signal directly from my mac pro however once jacked into the hotter signal from my motu ultralite the true power of the bx was revealed it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked these are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out your head should form a triangle with the two speakers that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties so don t buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use i mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings live and multitrack so the bass range is perfect for me the bass extends down to a clear hz so plenty ump for drop d and drop c tuning if you mix bass guitar and kick drum you ll want larger speakers bx or a sub but these are great for guitar i m used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass mid and highs for different room responses and taste oddly the pdf instructions show eq switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure rfi resistance i m an inner city dweller and live in a high rfi area cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes so one of the major selling points for me was m audio s claim of rfi shielding luckily that was no mere marketing jive they really are well shielded against rfi not a single wayward drum loop or dj in my tracks not even when cranked i can t make that claim for prior speakers i ve owned heat these speakers run on the warm side the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions i live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up not a deal breaker but it s wise to turn them off when not in use i use a power strip so i don t have to flip two separate switches construction these are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed cinema display and motu ultralite construction appears very good with dense particle board mdf cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit and matching plastic front molding around the drivers the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl these monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam and the tweeters sport silk domes no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick connections like most studio monitors the bx comes with pro audio style jacks for inch phone plug trs and xlr if you re a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks rca or usb so you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters if you re an experienced recordist you should have plenty of these cables laying around but otherwise be prepared to reach for your wallet one of the things i like about the bx is both the trs and xlr connections are active at the same time allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches i have an audioengine d dac connected to the trs phone input for itunes movies games etc while a motu ultralite for mixing tracking is plugged into the xlr connection last blurb yes the small focal speakers i listened to were better sounding and louder than the bx but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches however a perfect monitor for a home studio isn t only about a good neutral sound but also about compactness appearance and value and the bx nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine
1017	it s a very generic sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp the same is true of many of the pedals from this era including the gasp tube screamer the tube screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp but not too many people will tell you that it s a great stand alone distortion because it s not same goes for the boss ds now here s where things get interesting there are plenty of modifications that can be done to this pedal by keely monte allums and others that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks for the cost of this pedal and the or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod are well worth it mine is modified with the monte allums tri gain rectifier modification and it s absolutely killer i use it as a lead boost but by itself it s a nice overdriven tone that you ll find plenty of use for if you want a basic solid well built distortion pedal this is it but by itself the boss ds is really nothing special but as a platform for great sounding mods you can t go wrong yes it s cheap plastic yes the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours yes the battery is difficult to replace however this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet i solved the battery problem by using a spot outlet pedal power supply it doesn t sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here and it all sounds great it even has a modulated reverb which is a reverb with a slight flange chorus affecting the reverb signal only not the dry signal which is their version of the holy grail s flerb setting this is about the cost of the holy grail and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use unless of course you are an elephant for all the complaining i hear about this and other pedals with cheap plastic cases i have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it behringer pedals are hit and miss but this one is certainly a hit this is my first tube amp and after doing a ton of research i found that the vox ac c was just about perfect for me it came down to the ac fender blues jr and the ibanez ts the blues jr has a somewhat small enclosure for a x and i felt it had a bit of a boxy tone otherwise it s a great amp the ibanez has a classic tube screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes but it lacked a reverb circuit which was a deal breaker silly reasoning i know the ac has a larger enclosure than the blues jr and it has a reverb and tremolo circuit so it had the features i was looking for and most importantly it produces some killer tone if you ve ever seen or read a review of this amp chances are you ve heard about the classic vox chime which this amp has but i fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away the normal channel will break up nicely too but i would suggest an a b switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty i was worried at first that watts wouldn t be enough but fear not this amp is loud maybe too loud as i m just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom but that s not a bad thing it totally blows away my watt marshall solid state and i haven t put the volume much past o clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if i do while there is no effects loop it takes pedals well but for distorted tones i ve found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch which i ve come to love so much as stated above the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp or as previously stated running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an a b switch to go between them as far as other effects i really like what it does to my tc electronic flashback delay and corona chorus note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel but it controls the on off for the built in tremolo and reverb but it s sadly not included with the amp for my first tube amp i don t think i could have done much better i love the tone that i can get the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp it s feature rich and takes pedals well the other two amps that i was considering were a little less expensive and while i really feel that the vox is just a better all around amp i don t think you can go wrong with any one of the three the weight about lbs and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that i can think of while i would have picked up all three of the amps that i was looking at if i had the means i would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp this is very inexpensive and works great for my home wanna be purposes it is not superloaded with heavy delay etc but it definitely gives you the effect it links well with other pedals the battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a v plug in therefore i would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard v plug in on amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead i like it enough that i will probably get a few more of this company s petals as the effect is good and the price is right for my limited purposes this works great if you are a pro gigging or on the road you probably want to get a more versitile heavy duty and expensive delay petal people say its an ocd clone it sounds very similar i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges but its a very subtle thing all in all i m happy with it knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones good pedal to add
1018	hosa patch cables are the best for the buck great sound and flexible i m a firm hosa cable fan love these little guys i recently picked up a used casio privia px and it had a cheesy little square sustain pedal that slipped around and had a terrible feel i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals but purchased this anyway it worked i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open it also worked perfectly on my roland rd nx but i expected that what i love about this pedal is it has a fantastic feel that rivals a real piano and is the equal to the feel of my expensiveroland rpu one main reason why i gave this five stars in addition to the compatibility is it s built to last it s heavy all metal exterior except for the bottom pad and has a six foot cable that allows you to place it practically anywhere plus the price is right in fact the entire package is impressive when i compared it to other models that i considered and it s light years ahead of the oem pedals that casio ships with their privia keyboards this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended this microphone pics up instruments quite a bit better than my sm s it s quite a bit stronger of a microphone also i am really impressed with this mic the only thing i d like to see is that it would come with a cover bag like the shure mics do other than that you save a heck of a lot of money for the same and even better quality thanks a lot this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need i would personally recommend the electro harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks
1019	this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price i have absolutely no complaints this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed i recently sent two of my ovations back to the factory in connecticut for re work i just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them as soon as i took them out of their case and strummed them i immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings i ve ever played what exactly are they i might experiment with the exp s but by and large these exps are my new strings works great its a good product just what i expected i expect to buy more of these in the future and for its price its well worth it this is fine as a general stick on inexpensive pick holder it doesn t hold very many picks but it really doesn t have to i would give this five stars except that i really prefer the planet waves led key chain pick holder over this it costs more but has more functional value to me if all you need is something very simple and you have a surface you can stick it on then this is fine i thought it was a good deal when i saw the original price the discount stated it was off instead it was only cheaper than buying at my local music store other than the price the strings work great on my guitar sounds amazing i ll definitely be buying more of these not only is this a quality guitar stand that is adjustable it is really affordable to and it has a safety strap for the top of the neck of your guitar that will keep ur guitar from falling forward this is a great buy we bought the pyle pro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma we needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice for the price this worked a lot better than i expected but it did take some adjustment to the trim screw on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed we also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn t hanging in front of the speaker this might not be an issue for you depending on where you plug yours in there are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that i m sure would provide better sound and range but this one works just fine for our uses overall a good value for the low cost of this unit brough this for trying electric feels on the acoustic guitar and don t want to waste too much money on electric acoustic preamp guitar or big amp if i don t like the efeels after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it i decided to give it a try i didn t expect too much on amp but surprisingly it positively gives me more than i ask for i also brough it with the adaptor which is great to save for long runs and i don t have to worry about the battery for home practices it is adorable out of the box it looks like a lovely toy but it works professionally based on its w amp i don t care much about the manufactor s suggested modes basically i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar uke i like the small size that won t take too much space on my tiny room it s cute to look at and it is practical too i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup however when i changed to another one i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup i almost thought that was an issue from the amp luckily i have two different pickups to try it deeply after using the better pickup the amp doesn t have any issue yet i have used for few times so i don t know about its longevity yet one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar s sound itself won t be muted but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp anyway it s a great feature to have we opted for the world tour guitar gig bag over a hard case because most of the time my son s guitar is hanging on the wall usingstring swing hardwood home studio guitar hanger shades may vary this case is generally good quality and meets our needs with the following observations pros lightweight doesn t add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar good quality strong material stitching and zippers storage pockets big enough for music pages picks and a small electronic tuner handles good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapscons limited protection this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact appearance this is not awe inspiring to look at being very basic and the world tour logo looks a little cheesy this was a good choice for the limited light use it gets from us recommended cfh the pyle battery powered pa system with wireless microphone is surprisingly well made and has features i would have expected on much more expensive equipment we run workshops often at our customer s locations and needed a portable pa system that could easily be transported and doesn t require a lot of power here are my observations long battery life worked for over hours straight but can be connected to ac to work as well wireless microphone built into the system has good range and acceptable sound battery included inputs for microphones guitar and audio connection each with it s own volume control portable built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy includes a mini plug to converter a handy accessory includes echo effect a fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice my kids loved playing with this note my unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work this unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit highly recommended this is a good stand i ve had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before and this one is definitely much sturdier it fits every guitar i ve put in it just fine and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck if you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up i ve got two other levy s cotton straps that i picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they re fantastic i picked one up on amazon and i was unaware that there was an extended length version and that it was what i had bought before i suppose it s just easier for theno big deal though just an observation worth noting because if you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases and you re a big guy like me and or you play with the guitar bass around your knees you may not be getting what you thought in any case these are very comfortable soft edge they stick on you as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down and they last the picks we received were legacy and not alice brand while not as pictured these are good enough for us as we my daughert son and me learn to play guitars the mix of different thicknesses was fairly even so we were able to select the one that felt right for each of us the pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks cfh although the quality is obviously not that of a studio this guy serves it s purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it i use it when i mess around in garageband and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment it s also very easy to use and the usb cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer plus you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus this thing works great tiny and seems to be accurate the price is darn good as well a must for all guitarists i love my mxl microphone for its versatility warmth in capturing the voice and build quality most reviews i ve read of mxl microphones have always emphasized it s clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments the mxl studio aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable in short the mxl studio has an excellent build stand microphone easy to use software and clear recording capabilities features mm condenser capsule not very big but will suit most people cardioid pattern i recommend also looking at microphones with figure and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better zero latency monitoring a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have frequency response hz khz my mxl has a hz khz the hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows output headphone jack usb audio high pass filter hz hz hz software controlled lightweight gthoughts very impressive build it s built like a rock has a very fine finish the grill and the frame around the grill are solid i was surprised at how heavy the base was it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place it s not some cheap plastic the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl multi pattern studio mic the clarity and power isn t nearly as good as the mxl but is certainly close using an usb interface a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more with usb it s a bit more set for you but that may suit some people perfectly if you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software this is a solid option easy to use plug it in via usb and you literally on your way the software installation is optional the microphone works without it windows bit detected this microphone with no hiccups summarythe mxl studio usb microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build there are certainly cheaper usb condenser microphones but not many compare to the build and durability of mxl products like this one to me the fairly luxurious price of the mxl is justified with it s excellent build clear recording and the ease of use if you re not too sure about getting this usb condenser microphone or any usb microphone for that matter i recommend getting a condenser microphone non usb and plugging that in via usb interface if you need any guidance at all with that process i m more than willing to help out cheers if you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal i had a boss ds and metal zone mt and did not like them much because they re so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you re looking for then this is for you it offers rugged construction and true bypass the only problem i have had is that unity gain is at around o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone reading the product description may give you an idea about this product i received plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion it s solid well made and looks feels like it can handle the world tour get it after years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths i love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time may be due to vibration when packing setting up or maybe it s just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface no matter i won t be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again one advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size especially when connecting stereo devices much narrower than the degree metal shells with screws a couple of concerns i had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length as it turns out they don t contribute to higher noise levels and they are just the right length for all my pedal connections everything is connected using this single length patch love the color coding too especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and b channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light and what to do if one does fail toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature i ll always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board it s a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff love these patch cables
1020	works just fine great for little spaces between one pedal to another if there s more distance better use another type bue generally works fine and it s a good quality product clean signal no problems it works great for five of my lower power pedal type items including my line wireless receivers shure wireless receivers and several other pedals like my cry baby etc all at once however the transmitter for my shure wireless in ear monitor which requires less power than any of the other two items combined will not run even by itself when powered by the spot switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own and there is probably some little quirk in the shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn t get along with for most of my stuff it works great and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords this plug works very well i like the right angle connectors i have a korg pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals it included a multi plug cable but not a right angle one the connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard this works much better pedal infaltable es muyy bueno tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay como solo boss lo sabe hacer it does what is supposed to i ts a gate and clamps the noise as good as i expected at the begining i had problems with power some how it didn t power correctly but i was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain so i solved it isolating the mxr connecting it with another power supply and it work so i left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine also check config and the routing of the signal this might influence on how it works i have it right after my wha and before my compressor and it works just fine
1021	these strings are great for a string i started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel a string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have they sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string i have used on this guitar and i think they will last longer which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring works as advertised makes the fretboard look and feel nice i imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you re changing your strings wish i discovered these years ago comfortable and the grip works wonders nice clear tones with this pick tips thanks in my opinion this is the best amp in this category i know people who have the marshall and the fender i plugged into my little honeytone and i had the best sounding micro amp hands down they were both amazed with the sound they said well mine was only and mine was only too bad so sad for them i told them mine was since it doesn t say marshall or fender i only had to pay for a better sounding amp if you are looking for an amp with or watts and know what to expect from a micro this amp does not disappoint i own several of the snark tuners but the snark sn is my personal favorite it settles extremely fast and works with a wide array of instruments and couldn t be simpler just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and in an instant there it is the display is bright and easy to read and the graph has a lot of resolution the sn senses frequency through vibration but it also has a selectable microphone pickup it is transposable and it offers a metronome feature the sn is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful electric red color i just thought i would throw in another star review which is based on the cost vs quality factor i have several guitars and always thought epiphone to be an inferior guitar well i was dead wrong it may not have the price tag of my better guitars but it sure has the playability and sound especially for the tag on it great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection the simple yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat i will not shy away from epiphone anymore don t make the mistake of not picking up this guitar only because it s not stamped gibson well without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes usually in the lower octaves are a little off with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised this tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes the fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars highly recommended and it looks great too
1022	its a tight fitting case i am a proud owner of aepiphone les paul custom proand it fits as snug as can be when i ordered the case i assumed it would be made for my guitar it arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic i am sure i received a new case being perfectly protected as it was it hadn t a mark on it so as far as the construction it not a flight case by any means it looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job to protect the guitar my guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit with this said over time there is a possibility of wear i would predict the buckles may be the first to fail and then handle doesn t look as durable as it could be we ll see on that overall this is the case for the epiphone les paul i saw the gibson case and i just don t see them as superior enough to justify paying more i am satisfied with my purchase and i think most people would be five stars for now i will edit in the future if necessary i have been fortunate to build a small but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music all of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the years i ve been using string swings i ve never had a problem with them they hold every guitar regardless of neck shape or style since they swivel my fender necks are just as secure as my gibson necks the depth is adjustable so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics while i never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my nitro coated guitars i didn t want to take a chance so i use self adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar s finish i try and screw them into studs to support the weight and where i can t do it i hang some of my lighter guitars but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure although i sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw in anchors but made out of metal just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens i also strongly recommend as others have done that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars humidity is perfect i recommend the honeywellhoneywell hcm quietcare gallon output console humidifier with air washing technology they do what they are meant to do no complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them i bought one of snark s super tight tuners and found it to be less then advertised it will get you in tune but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less i am going to buy another so i have one in the studio and one on my stage rig buy it it s a great little tuner i don t know if from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body i know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that is the normal size for an adult however for its on sale at the time even if its not i can still learn to play since thats why i bought it is to learn the pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn t really affect anything since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine all togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good i am happy with it good clean sound at least with my headphone amp only amp i have comes with whammy bar thats what i know it as one volume two tone the pickup sector switch the cord that connects your guitar to your amp edit so now that amazon has grouped the guitar with many others mostly the color differences and that i have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar not saying much really but a little bit i have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume not much of an issue for me at least but worth mentioning
1023	good quality bag for my epi lp fit like a glove in fact i wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories this device is ok it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable convenient storage is its biggest plus hard to believe this was so bad i have a planet waves locking guitar strap which is a dream and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap however it is so thick that it can t really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap and when i tried to lock it the two pieces came apart go with the planet waves lock straps i don t play these myself i bought them for my daughter they look kinda flimsy but for the price they are ok for beginners to play you have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this what a pain oh well it was cheap enough to have around i actually like this bench a lot it fits into my gear back rolling duffle style that contains my cables power strips etc with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag i have the kt which is much larger seat area and easier to adjust depends on your preference i suppose this one is smaller lighter the other is larger easier to adjust volume control is nice two clicks to choose from the low click is better than the high one to my ear i would recommend this product good grip but too flexible and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks probably good for strumming but not good for lead i don t like these too much the back side will shed for a while before settling down the leather is rather soft i ve purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable this particular one is just ok i decided to try these because the normal picks i was using kept slipping out of my fingers that was several months ago i am still using these everyday pretty durable and reliable i do recommend these my revised review after about a year of use the one thing i hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out so if you re not careful your guitar will fall it is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap once every few days my original review very easy to install didn t require drilling i have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes although it looks a little bit big and clunky it s a small price to pay for stability i probably will get another set but may get the black ones instead of the silver because i think the black color may hide the clunkyness a little better overall a very good product i put this on my mandolin this does not work as well as some others i have tried but the other one i was using broke very easily so i looked for a different more sturdy design this works ok not the greatest but ok
1024	these fit snug on my shure sm beta a mics nice texture and it doesn t affect the sound of my mics i recommend em this works very good on a silver flute it s soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it would purchase again i think picks are like well you know a personal choice i bought these cause they are simple inexpensive and will compare to others i have been using these lately would buy again these are great they re small light weight easy to read accurate inexpensive this one offers an additional feature tap tempo metronome i ve got several guitars and capos this one is not too bad i would still prefer classic style seems like spring is a bit too strong price is great thou well without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes usually in the lower octaves are a little off with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised this tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes the fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars highly recommended and it looks great too
1025	this is a very good cable i don t forsee having any problems with it it s just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables if you need this get it the price is right and shipping was right on time winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well it s a fender heavy so there s not much else to say about that good price and selection here go for it if you re into playing blues these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage they allow you to bend the strigs easier i m not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment but i d use these anywhere i love the fit and the sound quality it doesn t come loose or wiggle once in place i ll get this one again i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals definetly buy the power supply with it though it just makes it better and easier to use very nice product overall korg ga guitar and bass tuner is a very good and helpful tool to any guitar player buy it you will never regret i bought this harmonica for our son the music enthusiast he loves it it seems to be manufactured well as it is substantive in weight and seems to be solidly built only time will tell but for now it seems to be a decent harmonica i actually bought two harmonicas for him just in case one breaks couldn t pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price our son says it s easy to use and has a good sound quality hey if it makes our son happy so be it highly recommend
1026	these are my favorite strings they last a long time and my fingers don t hurt when i play i tried martin strings once and hated them does not work for all guitars one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should i recently changed them out for a different type of eb s while they were good the were not exactly what i was looking for not sure the new set is either but time will tell
1027	i originally purchased these strings because of the gauges i wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around upon installing these strings i can t really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge but maybe it s too small to notice with the naked eye i m not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old daddario strings that they replaced they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new the guitar that i m using them on is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice and smooth overall i m satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings but i don t think i m ready to give up daddarios yet no matter the weight selections i ve found the ernie ball slinky series a worthy pairing for my acoustics theyy re responsive and twangy you will want this to save your battery s when there is no power around not much more to say good luck it sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box the chord works great no noticeable buzz i had to have the tweed to complement my vintage gear i d have given this a star rating but because of the tweed fabric outer the chord is constantly fighting you with kinks fun little rig needed something to play electric through headphones and this offered me that plus a mini amp when needed the sound quality is surprisingly hot bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
1028	if you are looking for a leather mandolin strap consider another strap the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man made material glued to the thin leather part i will be ordering the levys leather mandolin strap walnut this is one of the cleanest sounding mini amps you ll find mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound it does sound tinny through the speaker but am radio sounded just as bad through speakers i hated it at first until i plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the o drive knob very clean but i could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar s volume knob turning the o drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp i m building a speaker cab with a jensen speaker just for this amp according to many reports it will drive a x cab this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website technical support is also almost zero akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don t buy this product try finding a midi tutorial that is usable good luck with that chore added nov the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts i find that unbelievable it definitely changes the sound of my classical guitar for the better pavan tp it allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonics partials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental my initial thought was that it did away with the blurriness of the low bass to mid range response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitar s range amazing what a piece plastic can do highly recommended all that needs to be said is that it s a peterson just the best tuner s ever i also use one on my pedal board wouldn t use anything else
1029	well unless you absolutely botch production it s hard to go wrong with some guitar knobs typical plastic durable and looks good i have been using these strings for a while now they are consistent sound good have a good life and are very well priced through amazon they are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while i will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars throw this bad boy in anything and it will make a world of difference particularly if the tube being replaced was a cheap tube this pedal is exactly what i have been looking for since three years ago when i started performing the distortion on this is deep has long sustain and has a nice tone to it that the classic boss ds pedal does not have it s perfect for a great sound from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat bruising solos i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it however word of fair warning the pedal itself uses a v power charge rather than the typical guitar f x pedal v barrel jack look at the power supply of a boss pedal to see what i am talking about this proco rat pedal does not use that if you buy this pedal you will have to do one of four things buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal consistently use and replace batteries find a converter from barrel jack to mm jack be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself other than the above excellent pedal works exceptionally well in fact this works better than regular single layered pop filters i have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice well worth the money the build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands
1030	i have one of these in every one of my cases it s a plastic sponge holder with holes in it nothing special but it does the job if you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home this is it have not gigged with it as yet so no comments as to its toughness great value though my guitar strap was old i replaced it with this one as i didnt want to head into town is black and no frills i only use a few of them it s good to find what style fits you i d recommend it for finding what suits you
1031	i have multiple guitars for different styles i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads good tone good sustain and they stay in tune i play gigs a week on average and practice everyday these strings get a workout and i change strings when i start to lose sustain that s why i buy the packs so i always have spare sets on hand extreamly easy to use you can tune any instrumet witn this the display is bright and clear easy to see in the dark you can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument the price couldn t be better i just can t believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists i love this tuner it is accurate very reasonably priced i have ordered this tuner for fellow musician friends all of them love them best clip on tuner i have ever purchased you can t go wrong with aquila amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too long lasting made with quality improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a dollar uke sound like a dollar uke i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy
1032	this is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier the first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it this has a replaceable sponge you take it out soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container would say it gets more humidity out i have multiple guitars for different styles i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads good tone good sustain and they stay in tune i play gigs a week on average and practice everyday these strings get a workout and i change strings when i start to lose sustain that s why i buy the packs so i always have spare sets on hand stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment many years ago i had a fender stratocaster and i had to get rid of it so now i have the closest that i will ever get to that guitar again this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well this is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that s been around it s better because it cleans all at once this obviously is trying to copy the kyser brand capo and it does it pretty well feels a bit cheaper which it actually is both monetary and quality wise the cardboard insert in the package even has the lifetime guarantee but no info on where to mail it and that s pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect but other than that it s a good cheap capo
1033	looks vintage but works great at a great price as good or better than my monster cable for a lot less money excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning well designed and rugged construction i believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least more one button operation makes it simple to operate i m not on tour with any group i play for church and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home with other musicians willing to give their time plus an occasional gig for a town celebration or some such activity i ve got a few sound effects pedals and processors i like using but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car this mini pedaltrain easily holds four of my favorite devices it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy etc the case is awesome too heavy duty good stuff the board came with velcro tie wraps power head etc to mount and use your devices i had it up and running in a few minutes and it makes my travel and play experiences easy without looking for a roadie to get help the angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect since i first got it i ve rearranged once already talk about easy you ll be glad to have your sound effects mounted wired and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear tear on wires from just handling this little amp gives a warm and gritty sound arrived in days and free ship heavy little bugger small footprint allows me to place in my studio and get that deep sound like a big tube amp use a shure mike at feet and the sound is amazing recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue really happy with sound although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal i was recording in an hour had the software on my mac talking to it it sounds great with little of it s own noise the percussion loops are fine at least provide solid guides for recording i have a gnx that i love as far as this pedal goes i am just as happy i echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over fiddling with the small knobs update the software works well is very useful it loaded right up with no problem memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once i start using the pedal more often that s the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal more than worth it though
1034	i have a taylor which is in mint condition i always use martin on any acoustic i bought the taylor about months ago and have found that the medium martin strings are best for this particular guitar every acoustic is different though this is a great music stand i like how it s adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in it s very sturdy and well built i don t ever worry that it ll tip over i love it i would recommend it my pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as i can remember i d guess they have about years of wear on them i used to be able to deal with it violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem more recently i tried adding fine tuners on g d and a to make it easier to tune but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much i figured i d give the drops a try the change was immediate i was able to work with the pegs more easily and slippage went away immediately i decided to give it hours before changing strings when i did i also removed three fine tuners and still had the control i needed after changing one string things worked well but then i had the peg slip suddenly i figured i d try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault but it ended up slipping loose again i tried reapplying peg drops and that seemed to fix the problem after that i had no more slippage but i now have one peg that is binding the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended i don t expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect what symptoms indicate and so forth i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions but never heard back suffice to say the drops made an incredible difference but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure i d definitely recommend them but i hope to get some comments from users with more experience so i can have a better idea what makes people know it s time to reapply and what they experience when they do it the advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic not metal core strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners the effort i had without the drops made me avoid playing and i was using a yamaha sv most of the time that can be fun but i didn t realize how much i missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune
1035	i ve used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect very easy to grip and last long one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind highly recommand this for anyone needs pick after you use these the large flimsy old school picks will be used just when you don t have one of these babies available these are the best picks out there if you don t have these already you better purchase them now black or red the color is the only difference i don t know a lot about guitars and strings i bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there first time i ordered these was in a larger order and amazon forgot to put them in the box oops i contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge thank you amazon i like the tone of d addario s bronze strings i ve been playing more bluegrass y guitar lately so i ve switched to mostly using phosphor bronze but these strings have a great warmth that i really enjoy i also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the strings amazon has the best price on these and they re inexpensive enough that i can afford to change strings whenever i feel like it i like their tone and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time martin strings just wish i could afford a martin guitar they last and they stay in tune sound very good too great strings they last longer than some of the others and easy to re string the guitarother brands do not seem to stand up to ernie balls i ve used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity to use these you put your strap on your guitar as usual then put the locks on rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap once the lock has passed the head of the guitar s strap button rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up close position which should be about degrees from open position very simple and works very well i have not used any lock system that s perfect every one that i ve used failed at one point or another came off unexpectedly these work exceptionally well what i like about this design is that it doesn t require any modifications on the guitar or the strap you can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you don t have to replace the guitar s existing strap buttons but they do stick out a bit to keep the strap from sliding off so if you re concerned about looks you might want to try another system that s more discreet also i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends these will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons
1036	when you re just starting to purchase equipment and are on a budget look into plant waves line up of cables and such they offer good middle of the road accessories even high end also check them out they carry ok equipment these mic cables are working really well for me highly recommended i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence i got this to use on an old mac computer to allow me to use some equipment that needed more than a line level output it works great for that haven t used it for anything else though so cant comment there seems sturdy and well made as well works solid looks solid and had a good price i would recommend it to anyone i really like this pop filter i love my mxl microphone for its versatility warmth in capturing the voice and build quality most reviews i ve read of mxl microphones have always emphasized it s clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments the mxl studio aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface it keeps recording equipment minimal literally connecting just through the usb cable in short the mxl studio has an excellent build stand microphone easy to use software and clear recording capabilities features mm condenser capsule not very big but will suit most people cardioid pattern i recommend also looking at microphones with figure and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better zero latency monitoring a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have frequency response hz khz my mxl has a hz khz the hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows output headphone jack usb audio high pass filter hz hz hz software controlled lightweight gthoughts very impressive build it s built like a rock has a very fine finish the grill and the frame around the grill are solid i was surprised at how heavy the base was it has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place it s not some cheap plastic the recording capability is parallel to my experience with mymxl multi pattern studio mic the clarity and power isn t nearly as good as the mxl but is certainly close using an usb interface a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more with usb it s a bit more set for you but that may suit some people perfectly if you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software this is a solid option easy to use plug it in via usb and you literally on your way the software installation is optional the microphone works without it windows bit detected this microphone with no hiccups summarythe mxl studio usb microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build there are certainly cheaper usb condenser microphones but not many compare to the build and durability of mxl products like this one to me the fairly luxurious price of the mxl is justified with it s excellent build clear recording and the ease of use if you re not too sure about getting this usb condenser microphone or any usb microphone for that matter i recommend getting a condenser microphone non usb and plugging that in via usb interface if you need any guidance at all with that process i m more than willing to help out cheers
1037	it works pretty well on my ukulele however it left several dents and scratches on the tuners of my ukulele tubulaarrrrholds my string string acoustic etc has held up very sturdily over the year i ve had it or so i love these clip on vibration reading tuners this was the second one i tried the first was a barcus berry which worked equally well they both have lots of features such as tap tempo up and down tuning adjustments with the barcus berry it was the first one after trying the snark which is a cool name and a lot more colorful i tuned up a brand new guitar in a store out of the box in less than minutes never came close to doing that before that convinced me the quicktunes i had been using were accurate but these seemed to be better and get you perfect i have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments which makes sense they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric from the literature it seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals that have been raved about hello raving bout this i seen on amazon they are cheaper i bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for here they are around to bucks these type of tuners especially the intellitouch are popular wih bluegrass folk like me the grapics on this are great no more shaky needle just a dead on still reading when you are perfect
1038	i love this product it came fast included extra shockmount line shockmount an adapter the mic instructions and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting the sound quality is great with the art tube preamp use mic cables not cables for phantom power and i couldn t be happier with it it even looks impressive although i do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny when in reality it is this off silver color almost a gold but not quite it s not bad or anything just different and frankly the thing could be purple for all i care as long as it produces great sound that s all that matters great product and extremely affordable no complaints behringer doesn t have the best of reputations but some of their gear does a great job at the price this is one of them this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface i needed this because sometimes i need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording monitoring a track my main headphones are beyerdynamic dt pro sennheiser hd sony mdr v and then i have some others all of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and i get very good volume and even at the exact same volume as the input i find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp it s hard to describe but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger i ve had a presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better the volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that i can hear that is introduced by this amp make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in for instance if i run a cable from my imac s built in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume i can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds but that s not the amp it s the source running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong there are some annoying things about this amp obviously the external power supply is annoying there s no on off switch and it s light enough that when everything is plugged in it doesn t want to stay in place however that s nothing that velcro tape on the desk can t fix and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones the cable is good and normal good price and works well the rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and i have to push them in place all too often is a nice cable god quality as always with the fender brand guys if you need a cable that are not high budget and a god quality this is the cable i got these recently a local music shop was wanting per stand so couldn t believe the price of these was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised great quality an very robust these headphones are amazing i could not believe the sound quality i have been an audio engineer for over years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth nice wide spectrum and frequency response you will love them well worth the price no i do not work for tascam the first pair i bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily so i ordered another pair because the sound is amazing i just need to be more careful next time but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction i have yanked my senhieser s millions of times and the cord never broke so be careful with the cord on this headphone it is not the best but the sound is superior
1039	i ve used these elixir strings for years and i would never change these have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others i ve been playing guitar for about years and within the last year bought my first taylor guitar taylor guitars ce ltd grand auditorium acoustic electric guitar it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory i am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce what s even better is how long they last i m pretty hard on my strings i usedunlop standard tortex picks pack purple mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly the nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several months instead of weeks they re a little bit more expensive then other major string brands but after about a year of listening to these only gone through sets so far they re worth the extra few bucks i have used d addario for a number of years i m not hot about their acoustic but electric they re a whole new world i like these nickel on my tele they give them that extra twang these strings are my second choice after the elixir bronze they are warmer sounding well balanced cost a lot but well worth it to me this pedal essentialy balances out the high mid and low frequencies yout instrument produces i also have the software version of this effect on my daw this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians not as good as the headstock tuner i purchased i used it a few times it can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic i wouldn t buy another one i have had plenty of these lots just snap apart in the back or don t even work properly when you try and tune them this one is spectacular it is real accurate snaps on to the headstock perfectly best i ve ever found so far in a tuner
1040	i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recording producing i absolutely love these picks and swear by them i ve been a guitarist for almost years and these were the picks that i landed on years ago and stuck to i ve had years of lessons licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms i d order again if i had to these pins are amazing one u never have to worry about breaking them they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain very cool this is a great stand for your violin or viola i use it all the time and i feel that my violin is very safe in it at gigs this is a good quality product as advertised fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument i am satisfied this pick is well designed for mandolin playing unlike standard guitar picks it has generously radiused corners it s also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing
1041	though i d warn if you don t know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de esse the whole thing but between the pop filter and a slightly off center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses s from making an appearance in any way that cloth they should have included something that doesn t fall apart otherwise it s great i use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned but i m with other people here who commented that you can t really tell how much of the stuff is left inside good idea to keep more than one of these around they will always sound the same as the very first day i love this strings currently on all my guitars i wasn t sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable but i am now it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp i did a little experiment i plugged in my old cable played the guitar as i adjusted the amp until i got a pleasant sound from the speakers then i turned the amp off unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new monster rock cable next i simply turned the amp back on the sound levels were already set and i did not touch them and played my guitar again the volume was louder and i think nicer with the new monster cable i m buying a few more monster rock cables to replace all my old cables not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand solid heavy base well built does the job of holding a mic no more no less monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price it s flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable it s much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables for the money it s really hard to beat i won t waste money on the more expensive cables again works great and doesn t cost an arm and a leg quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence great price too fits mxl cube mics perfectly sturdy and easyt to setup ordered two more rare to get items these days that exceed expectation two weeks in and i can already feel it drying up good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled but it seems it will cost me a fortune if i keep using these i was surprised when i tested this microphone it is probably the best bang for the buck at its price range the base is heavy enough to allow the microphone to stand upright however the clip does not open wide enough to clamp onto thicker monitors that was expected though accurate little accessory only works with guitars it seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar i don t know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments or for uses other than tuning
1042	again these microphones are made for studio i use it live again you have to have a good pa system for these to work great great microphone if you want to really sound like a real singer this is the top of the top thank you amazon i was originally was about to purchase a cheaper thinner cable but settled on this planet waves classic series xlr cable i wanted mymxl multi pattern studio micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it i also have my microphone and this cable connected to theyamaha audiogram audio interfaceand it works flawlessly sturdy cable it is thick and flexible at the same time it curls around my microphone stand well too good connector heads at the female end microphone there is spring part that locks in the microphone in nice added peace of mind this cable simply feels strong and well made phantom power and data transfer has been flawless i highly recommend this quality xlr cable update still working great after months forgot to mention the nice packaging it s eco friendly and nicely packaged it also has a lifetime guarantee not a warranty a guarantee that speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product i bought these to fit my two microphones they snuggly hold shure sm and sm however my two mics came with shure clips to my surprise these clips are in from front to back in comparison the shure clips are in to in from front to back so the shure clips are more sturdily built but both seem to hold the mics well i operate an alternative broadcast studio we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet we needed some stand alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet i decided to give this behringer unit a try this single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output before i even tried the piece as a preamp i opened it up to look inside do not expect to change the tubethe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube there is no schematic provided so it s really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit how does it soundthe preamps sound very good full rich crisp highs deep lows it s a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as i can tell for comparison i a b compared this preamp to our very expensive api preamp which is a channel unit that we paid over per preamp channel for that is times the price per channel of this behringer unit i m not going to say the behringer beat the api but they were a dead heat in most listening tests my female partner who is not too technical but has great ears thought the behringer was just as good as the api we also have a grace m which is another over channel preamp she definitely liked the behringer sound better than the grace personally i think it was the eq on the behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the grace if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired if the behringer dies it s going in the trash and i ll buy another one it s simple economics and at for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice they sound good they have an industry standard packaging the input and output connectors are excellent it even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line level signal i have not tried this because we don t need it we broadcast between three and ten live one hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals nobody in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit it is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast i ve never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it we have a lot of behringer gear in our studio it lives right along side gear from neve api allen and heath ua meyer lexicon and apogee out of pieces of behringer equipment i ve bought we ve had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box i had much worse reliability with crown amplifiers than behringer products and i really like crown amps regardless of the problems they just sound so good in my experience the behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price that s a win win in my book bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my bit neo ive been using the mxl mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective used it forabout minutes before crackling and static started had to go back to the until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of i still recommend the mic though it is hotter than the in its highs but with good compression power amp and eq the result is well worth the money its the exact same thing as my shure mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material thats fine by me they fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should
1043	hard to day too much but it works great no issues to speak of it does the job perfectly well the first thing i do when i get a new instrument is put a straplok on it before gigging with it they re easy to install i haven t had one fail on me yet i have straploks on nine instruments right now and i just ordered another for my new bass i can t recommend them highly enough these strings aren t for everyone and probably not what you want for everyday normal playing but if you re looking for a fast playing string with a bright sound this is the string in addition to putting them on my guitar i also have a six string banjo guitar tuning and just couldn t get the sound i wanted from regular guitar strings light guage nickel strings were recommended to me and they were exactly what i was looking for they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming i play a lot of bluegrass and irish music and i feel these strings are ideal for that purpose i use a lot of d addario strings on my various instruments and i think they offer the most bang for the buck in terms of quality and tone you can pay more but i don t think you get that much more although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars i ve used d addario s on so many different guitar s the only opinion i can honestly give ya is that they are the best in the studio or on stage they stay in tune and work very well with any pickup you are using i put these on my wife s bass cause she is still learning and with a fender squire it sounds almost as good as a precision fender bass they stay true to the note so she will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time works just fine except the bottom part that is supposed to support the guitar swivels not sure what that s about but i m not very picky and know nothing about guitar stands so maybe it s supposed to not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob there its that this mic for my use is useless it records tooo low cant get enough volume from it this has got to be the best little tuner i ve ever owned and the cheapest too i have a tuner that works nicely but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to the sn has the vibration pickup abitity that the sn doesn t so i use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there s no place to clip it i highly recommend it
1044	this microphone works well for our needs i purchased refurbished so when i received the microphone the mic piece is actually removed from the handle it could be from shipping i re attached the item and added a windscreen now my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore please don t listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn t keep tune they don t know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch like all instruments the strings have to stretch especially with nylons so be patient it only took me about half an hour it clearly states starter pack so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele especially because of the price these people just do not know how to read it has a great sound but the lightweight gig bag definitely is lightweight if you want real protection i would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines it is a great buy though considering the price i highly recommend this product for the price of one saddle at gcyou get of these and the nut assembliesi keep them handy for guitar setup changesordered on monday arrived on thursday
1045	i m an irish style dadgad guitarist these picks cut through the string really nicely and are great for driving rhythms i m starting to lean towards the tortex mm though i think the roughness on the surface of the dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that i don t like still great picks it was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin at least it won t fall off soon i just got another mandolin with no button and this strap has no way to attach to it it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable it has good lenght between two plugs you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals i purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together it does and it does it well very solid build never felt cheap in any way perfect for its intended use i purchased a second one after using the first for one month would buy again should the need arise one was dead on arrival the other one works like a champ i like the old version more these are a little tricky to mount but do track well and are not obnoxious looking like the snark tuners
1046	first of all i use this as more of a band eq using the lower and highest more for lp and hp filters the middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone you can also use this as boost box using the gain and volume sliders the box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage but i tend to set and forget in reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful if you turn your gain way up you will have hiss period this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that i have been exposed to have a reason for upping your gain if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp eq is to enhance your tone not create it a strat cannot be made to sound like a les paul and vice versa your tone is made up of many many variables the resulting tone can be shaped or colored by adding or subtracting certain frequencies that is the function of an eq nothing more it can range from dramatic to very subtle very small changes can have large effects small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics i am able to produce i tend to put the eq in much later in my effect chain but feel free to experiment come with all cables needed solid and very much worth the money im very happy with this purchase no regrets at all ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time they sound great and i have yet to have use set of strings by ernie that were faulty or disappointing in any way of course i have only used a few other brands of strings so i don t have an arsenal of wisdom to compare the quality of these strings to but do take my word when i say that these are extremely reliable good sounding and affordable i ve been playing guitar for over years both teaching performing and never used a pedalboard i used to carry the fx s in a briefcase and setup the ones i needed i m old school when it comes to these boxes i run compression wah overdrive super overdrive delay reverb pretty much in that order sometime i use a phaser or a tremolo i also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but don t use them much i currently have pedals setup on this board i have room for one maybe two more the board itself is built like a tank and travels well the bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but i wouldn t take it on tour without a metal case i did go ahead and velcro down all the pedals that i always use leaving a little room for add ins be sure you want to velcro down the fx chain because to get the best most secure it won t fall off the board when you pick it up off the floor i found that i had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal the velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned boss mxr mod tone and other high end well made pedals work best once set on the board you can run any number of power sources to it there is plenty of room for all my needed connections i leave the choice of that to you the reader at the end of the day it s easier for me to move my fx pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable i m very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it tis pedal really did for me what i wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt hard rock and heavy metal classic metal is where it shines i don t mess with the noise gate so i can t really comment on that but everything else is first rate
1047	i first want to mention that this is a pack of picks the product description didn t mention that but i was pleased to receive more than three my son told me he needed some new picks and since lately he s been playing ozzy osbourne songs i knew he needed a better pick than the standard fender picks he s been playing with for three years after hearing him play with these picks i ve noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these the finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks i wish we could choose the color or maybe they could send a color assortment we ll be buying these for a long time to come this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does it s job no scratches or anything on my taylor it falls over now and then but only when i run into it i purchased these to use with my mandolin they are ok i personally prefer a little stiffer pick but my kids have been using them with their uke s so all in all not a bad purchase this stand is a little difficult to open the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it i needed a small capo for my mandolin and so i purchased this little guy works great though i have to put it on at that st fret and then move it up to where i need it this is a great little uke for the money i ve bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts as many have noted tuning stability improves greatly after the strings stretch in one suggestion if you re willing to add a bucks to the purchase price buy a set of d addario or aquila strings and put them on right away the stock strings are pretty poor even a set of dollar strings is a vast improvement other than that i love these little guys and plan to keep on buying them finally if you buy this or any other uke do yourself a favor and watch the movie mighty uke you won t stop smiling d addario j ukulele strings sopranoaquila aq s nylgut soprano ukulele stringsmighty uke the amazing comeback of a musical underdog
1048	to be honest i was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to megadeth s first album kimb so far i havnt got a perfect setup on it yet but ive got close enough to it this pedal is great only a couple notes i should make about it do not buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock or just rock in general this pedal is for metal the battery drains like a mf i dont understand why the only possible explanation i can think is that i leave it plugged into guitar and amp but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its turned on i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy keeps things in place one problem the coating will wear out in a short time a few months and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside this might make it a bit hmm i don t want to say hard to lock but you d better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure mine has un clipped a couple times because i didn t check our climate is humid so it s rust friendly which could contribute to why i m having issues however once clipped properly you shouldn t have issues great buy within just three seconds of using the electro harmonix pocket metal muff pedal i knew it was a winner it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra easy to use although it doesn t have a tone dial it doesn t need one and i say that after trying it through a small tube amp w a small digital amp w a guitar with humbuckers and a guitar with single coil pickups the closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on off switch as its name suggests this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be scooped it has three settings no scoop to maximal scoop and all sound great fans of sustain will love this box for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain the pedal is extremely small which most would regard as a plus i bought this after watching a professional looking youtube demonstration of it it more than lived up to my expectations if i lost this box i d immediately order another one i have zero regrets i bought this as for practice i have a amp but was looking for something a little more portable this is what i came to it has great distortion the effect is pretty awesome too the lead cuts clean mostly in general is does tend to get a little noisy though however for the price this is probably one of the best steals ever like i said i have a sort of name brand amp that is estimated at around i can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp until i can afford a really good amp this will be my primary one and really i have no problem with that pros cheap price fair sound quality nifty built in effect can plug into aux letting you play with musiccons cheap item quality distortion can get messy not very versatile metal only i hope it never breaks this tuner is cool it picks up even the lightest vibrations i e i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out i also like the capo tuning feature you put a capo on the rd and tell the tuner to flatten x i highly recommend this tuner
1049	there s no such thing as a best string from experimenting over the years i ve found that while i have old standbys that will be the first thing i try often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years they re expensive but they last a lot longer especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly also they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings elixir polywebs were the first coated string the coating is much heavier than that of other strings this produces a much less bright more muted sound i have an old koa guitar that is so bright i can t stand it with standard strings the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where it s perfect if you re looking for a darker sound then elixir polywebs are definitely worth a shot if you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings then you definitely don t want polywebs the stars applies if you want this particular type of sound if you don t want this sound you could end up awarding them star daddario s are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics they sustain well great tone tune well and last for a good while between changes we ordered one it worked so nicely we ordered more you can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar and minimize string stress and de tuning each time you move your capo very nice product i m raising my rating and the result getting demoted from the front page in any case even though i recently picked up the sony pcm d from amazon i m sufficiently impressed by the zoom h to give it stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders for quite a while its only competition was the edirol r but as the price has come down the zoom h stands out from its immediate competition currently the h is my back up unit but for convenience or stealth purposes i often use it as my main recorder anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed production values haven t been spared in terms of the packaging the included equipment no batteries but a power adapter protective pouch handy table stand mic stand adapter wind screen ear buds usb cable and a mb sd card and the manual a quick set up sheet plus an ample booklet with generous sized print written in clear idiomatic english that makes some of sony s recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparison the screen and controls admittedly are minuscule requiring sharp eyes though the screen is well illuminated and nimble fingers i much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my sony to the touch pad of the zoom what s encouraging about this recorder apart from the price is that the designers at zoom have made the h with the genuine audiophile and or all around musician in mind it s not simply another guitar player s gadget loaded down with an endless supply of effects loops rhythm and bass tracks files within files programs buried within programs the h unlike my pricey sony can handle both wav and mp protocol has microphone fields ranging from degrees to degrees is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures conversations solo performers and orchestras in short the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or more and in a practical digital storage card format other pluses although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by sony costing and respectively the zoom onboard mic actually is darn good it captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clock s chimes from upstairs and it s reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past a single tiny hole is more common these days getting the recorded signal onto a computer s hard drive is expedited with the included usb cable and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like cool edit which i strongly recommend over editing in the recorder there s also a metronome on board potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions and a tuner useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recording possible drawbacks zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistles limiters compressors cut off levels agc control auto dynamic levels sensitivity ratios panning effects and the list goes on it s too easy to miss a step to waste precious time fumbling with the menu to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments moreover the instructions while clear and abundant omit much information that would help the beginner the hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone who s a complete newbie to someone who s a knowledgeable aficionado and i have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screen s menu to get to a metronome or tuner frankly with kids squirming in their seats i d go to the old single function dial up block shaped metronome without a second thought the h is so light that using it with the ac adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely undoubtedly you ll want to pick up a to gb sd card and a good supply of double a batteries it takes only to record in the field at standard mp meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours the adaptor would have made more sense if zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder my h would not connect to my imac with osx leopard without downloading an upgrade from the zoom site after having some difficulty with the install i decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in real time what s encouraging about this recorder apart from the price of the h of the edirol r is that the designers at zoom have made the h with the genuine audiophile and or all around musician in mind perhaps the primary deal maker or breaker the tiny screen and small controls until mastering the miniaturization i would want to have a back up cassette recorder for any performance that i judged of special importance as for build quality my h is like new after almost months use undoubtedly you ll want to pick up a to gb sd card and a good supply of double a batteries it takes to record in the field at standard mp meg quality you should be good for dozens of hours the adaptor would have made more sense if zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder my h would not connect to my imac with osx leopard without downloading an upgrade from the zoom site after having some difficulty with the install i decided to forget about it especially after seeing how slow i mean really overnight slow the machine is in normalizing a long file or converting it from wav to mp what takes minutes with a software program like sound studio or wiretap studio requires hours when you re using the zoom as a computer interface use it for what it does best namely produce realistic audio from a tiny weightless durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame its expensive rivals the snark is great i have for my ukuleles so i can always find one and a rd for my guitar it s not just a uke tuner love them and gavemy grandson a shock blue one to go with his american flag painted uke i really love this little tuner i just keep it on the headstock of my guitar when playing just touch up tuning if needed best tuneri have owned for the price r joyner the compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons school or a gig works well added december has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the star rating stands without an asterisk added november i put the star back i ve got another one on one of my banjos it does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck either mine or the banjo s to see it clearly but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and there s no neck to snap while it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddle s scroll it seems firmly rooted to the banjo s headstock original november this tuner has a display like the sn rather than the sn after which it is named it s like any other snark super tight tuner i ve taken off star for two reasons i find i have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it maybe it s just a matter of finding the right place to put it i ll keep trying my music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time it was clamped solidly on the scroll but to do that and have it be comfortable to read the tuner was hanging down while playing eventually it slipped off if it weren t kept on this wouldn t be an issue but that s how the advertising shows the tuner being used clamped to a guitar headstock hanging down i ll report back if it doesn t happen again for a while even if this is an issue its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use so i still think it s worth stars
1050	its a nice pice easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar the only matter and its not a big deal is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks i d use it for lightweight guitars using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder i always suggest this strap to kids who spin their guitars while on stage this strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage not bad at all this unit tunes really well same as the boss original the only difference is that this one takes like sec to respond after the pedal is activated the boss is instantaneous other than that both units behave exactly the same some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor for those of you who do not want to spend on a tuner this one is just perfect since i am a collector i have other brands to compare boss korg fender and it is the same thing it is as accurate as the boss at least mine is and is a good mute switch also i am happy with mine i normally tune to drop f on my string but even in standard i just cant stand the strobe and theres no other mode i ordered a pitch black for im still waiting on the return for this
1051	i bought one of each soft medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right the hard is as soft as the soft they felt exactly the same in fact the medium was the hardest out of the bunch packaging error i have no idea the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing so check with what you get sound wise the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar making it sound really dull and muted there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly i have had enough the main problem with this tuner is the usability the tuner has a poor display is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key tuning with it can be condensed into one word frustrating the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings especially so when the guitar is much out of tune the poor display is dark with no build in light and has poor visibility at angles too combine all that you have a terrible accurate tuner yes it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display which is cents enough said i bought a new tuner the seiko sat for a bit more money that this the main differences between sat and the ca sat has a build in light ca does not ca has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a deg angle sat does not sat has a auto and manual mode ca has auto sat displays the octave of the note e g e e etc ca displays only displays the alphabet e for all oactaves sat has a numerical display for the cents off ca does not the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be rugged good looking efficient sorta like me have several tuners of different names and quality but this seiko is certainly the quickest the rubber housing is an excellent idea would buy another this thing is a tank i don t think you could break this beast if you wanted to the last string winder you will ever buy perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike as strictly an issue of natural acoustics i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar s output and resonance i have an aria ad which is a very well made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d it can not compete with the real martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a sound canon for it s great natural volume adding the o port deadened the lows it just didn t provide any plus at all anywhere else it is however pretty inexpensive so if you re a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it s not going to break your bank but again if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person voiced it in his or her manufacturing process this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything i m an acoustic nut and i d love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box the o port seemed to corral the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole sorry to be a crab about it i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the humidipak recall a few years back but this product was a waste to me
1052	i was using the standard version of these i saw these at amazon and figured i d give them a try these cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables i was using however the ends seem much more well belt doesn t make a difference in the sound i don t know but i am satisfied with this purchase great cord for the money works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas will buy more in future i got this duet instead of the single light version as most kindle users do so far i really like it cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read even better than day light the only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflection the ac adapter is a great money saver as i usually read hours at night and burning up aaa batteries each night is not really a solution if you have a kindle dx i would strongly recommend this duet instead of the single light version cuz there s almost twice as much screen to cover of course i also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the kindle it s a versatile light source and i really like it a lot
1053	will hold any guitar that i ve seen it holds the guitar on the wall safely without having to worry about it falling it s also very easy to install it s a great price and it s definitely worth the investment not only do you not have to have your guitars on the ground but you save space putting them on the walls and not only that but it make any room look even better works great haven t had a problem until now very durable and not uncomfortable either really awesome item for any type of electric guitar i purchased these for a fender squier affinity strat be aware that they will not fit a squier without drilling some holes the stock tuners have one peg these have two despite this installing them was quite easy they have a high build quality and work great i was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first but now i m glad i did
1054	i purchased this key on a whim when it arrived the instructions were not clear but i sat the dial to loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning too loose and deep so i increased the setting to and repeated almost the sound i wanted so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern perfect i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest using the setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms octave apart next i worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side i used on the batter side and on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound i wanted the bass drum came next i set the batter side tension notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained this is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned set i ll never go back to tuning by ear you ll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and don t forget to write down your optimum settings this is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi hat pedal but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top this allows you to either ride closed hi hats when using both bass pedals yet return to normal hi hat playing when the music calls for it be aware that this clutch has only two positions open and fully closed however there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound i did a work around by placing a spring on the hi hat stem with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring which gives me that opening when i drop the cymbal to closed there was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together and i was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound too large or stiff and you will not get the sound however this is all personal preference and many drummers ride a fully closed hi hat anyway which makes this clutch perfect out of the box regardless of your hi hat style if you are using a double bass this is a must have accessory gibraltar s model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time these heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound attack is superb especially when played hard and loud and the construction ensures minimal ring and overtone be aware that this head pack does not product the best tone and sound for jazz get remo fiberskyns for that kind of sound but the pinstripe model that comprises this pack has become the de facto standard for rock if you still have the heads that come with your drum kit and play rock changing over to this pack will probably make a dramatic improvement in the way your kit sounds regardless of whether you are playing a budget no name brand or pearl mapex tama ludwig or similar pro quality drums i also recommend that you get a rhythm tech memo key asin b e eoe or evans torque tuning key asin b d hzi to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have them installed either of these will allow you to get the most out of these or any other heads and transform your kit into a finely tuned professional sounding set of instruments incredible quality and value these cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than i expected for the price they use heavy duty wire and insulation and are well constructed they employ quality connectors and have strain reliefs on each end the dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables and the color coding is a big plus as well not only is the product outstanding but i was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure i was happy with the cable set i am so pleased with this purchase that i am a customer for life love these pedals good buy
1055	i have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back this was difficult so for the longest time when i had my studio setup i had a mixing board going into the interface it is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine this board is great no sliders which i had to clean the board has all the same features that were on my channel dod board that i used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk the only thing that i am not keen upon is that there is no on off switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time it makes the stuff i do in logic easy this is a home use unit great for the price as well as for its quality not a whole lot to say about it quality materials works well love to keep my taylor on it but had to re case the guitar during our low humidity days we ve been only using it for two days and so far so good i cannot say anything about durability for now but i ll update this review if it breaks one of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old boss tu chromatic tuner forever for her violin and i finally bought this for her there are many clip on tuners but i liked the following about this tuner lcd mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you re off as opposed to just flat or sharp you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway but a mic sometimes comes in handy can set different pitch than a not expensive was less than including shipping upon delivery i tried it on my guitars both acoustic and electric using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid and was impressed it is quick to track the note even for low e it s not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on no stress whatsoever indeed it s just as quick and smooth as my boss lcd is bright and clear and needle ish display works as expected it worked very well on violin too and i saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun and a note about the looks from the picture i expected it to be ugly but actually it was not that bad it s tiny and doesn t look like a fisher price product first update nov i ve tried it on an electric bass string and it worked equally well still stars second update oct it s still working happily for my daughter and i bought a second unit for myself fantastic product it s a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost the fact that it looks like it s made out of bat armor is a huge plus for a clip on you can t beat the accuracy this little unit gives you
1056	this compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians electric guitar rigs it s very basic two controls and one toggle but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal both my jazz bass and my precision bass sound great through this pedal bought several of these and they worked fine i later moved on to planet waves for my custom pedal board because i could get the lengths perfect this pedalboard is very solid durable and easy to pack in their soft case which i love especially because it makes my pedalboard and some extras much easier to carry to and from gigs there is space below the pedalboard for cables to run and the velco and glue they provide to keep the pedals on the board are very reliable the mini is the perfect size for me but overall i ve been very pleased with pedaltrain in general
1057	bought this as a back up to my at system and have only tried it in my living room home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although i think i hear a little distortion if i turn the gain up too much i don t think you can change the gain on the at system my only nitpick is that i ll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a for the price it s amazing i just hope it works in the field as well this mic has amazing quality i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about years feels great to finally have professional sounding music check out my soundcloud soundcloud com ljaymusic really dope mic bought these for home karaoke and they work great i also have a weekend dj business and these work well professionally why spend more my dj business includes up to shure wireless mics at around a piece but these inexpensive nady s seem just about as good in sound and performance very few drop outs if you stay within feet of the receiver i ll probably start taking these on gigs since they are so affordable to replace if they break the traditional black box tuners are boring and slow this thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately exact easy to use fun to look at there is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better great laser nice big fat stars red and green worth the money point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me great effect this boom has cleaned up my desk quite a bit and is great value for the price performance ratio i have an at in it and it holds it in place with no problems wish i would have known about it sooner
1058	these dunlop mm picks are the right size not to big or too small been using these for years always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases they never wear out they are not too stiff or too flimsy they work good for the sound on the strings easy to hold on to i had a hard time lineing them up to install the little knob on them made it very hard to install so good luck the eminence patriot cannabis rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker i ve ever heard period this does not mean that it s dull sounding or muffled at least not if you hearing is still good i hesitated quite a bit before i decided to buy it and install it in my fender mustang ii but my worries were for naught incredibly it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds yet for overdrive sounds there is very little fuzziness just a big full and fat sound that s articulate without being buzzy if you play metal you ll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy classic rock and jazzy sounds this is a speaker to seriously consider i turned my mustang ii into an open back combo and the cannabis rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed i had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps it never got shrill or piercing just buttery smooth and clear it s also much more efficient than the stock speaker at db w m i don t know how eminence did it but i love it while ordering a guitar case the guitar strap popped up and i could not pass up the deal i found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good versus the godlyke i d say this is the better purchase though the godlyke product claims ma of power amps this is slighlty less at ma ma or amps anyway if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board you may want to re consider what you are using the product itself is plastic but seems solid i believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem being plastic though you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over etc i do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into spot as advertised the heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their x cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival the extender that comes with is good seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get i only wish it came with two of them i am using a pedaltrain pro board and at inches it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals the combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use power connections some volt adapters for pedals with out any external power one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply a lot of companies think that if their voltage is close to volts thats good enough the reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product you will find some higher end devices specifically warn not to use anything higher than volts so volts isn t close enough anyway while i have not checked the output of the adapter yet i did fire it up on all the pedals i could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet it is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other noise from your signal chain i d buy this again and in fact i may buy another just as a back up it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but all in all a good buy over the competition snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find and they tune with amazing accuracy if this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better but there s already another model for that in one way it s better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while you re tuning so this tuner is a pretty good choice i bought these because i needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board i have the planet waves patch cords called so i thought these would cover it being when i went to hook up they were still too short so i immediately blamed these cords ooooops took out the tape measure so i could complain and found that these are indeed i then measured the planet waves and found they were actually not my bad these seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are if you want to spice up your board go for some color not the greatest pedal gives a really broken sound there is no mid way on this pedal either it seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing the octave is a joke having said all that i could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance
1059	this is a handy little tool the winder is nice and the clipper works well it doesn t pull the bridge pegs out so it doesn t get five stars from me and don t be too rough when winding or it will break i have been using hercos for for many years they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification i place a herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits for guitars i place a herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness item is as described you receive felt picks plus a bonus ant hill music pick mine was purple picks were defect free but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks which a clean moist cloth will easily fix but because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument none the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit but over time this starts to disappear the picks are pretty comfy to hold they sound pretty good they tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments this is a very sturdy and well made bag much better for the money than i was expecting i wish i could find a guitar bag that was this nice my uke is very cozy inside the pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks kazoo ukulele stand whatever you need to have with you i carry an ipad around when i play the full size ipad doesn t fit in the outer pocket so i put it on the back of the uke on the inside an ipad mini would probably fit
1060	it can hold the weight of any of my guitars its easy to install and i guess its cheap it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter we ve all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job when i see the word microfiber i always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck this cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing i ve tried before with no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it this would be great for any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions reasonably priced too it s a strap it s pretty well made it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it it costs or less delivered what more could you ask for in a strap there may be better ones out there but at more and this does the same thing this is great if you have to put your guitar down but don t want to put it in its case i don t own the srh s but rather the srh s it was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the s in terms of sound and comfort i didn t believe the sound part but i bought them because i at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my s when i got them they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals they are definitely more comfortable i don t know what it is but something about the sound is different and i don t think it s placebo there seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places i wouldn t expect i highly recommend this upgrade works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too i wanted p pickups they do make noise kind of like an old album once you start playing you don t notice it though other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on it looks really good
1061	this is a great cymbal stand sturdy tight well made using it with a crash and does not move or rattle amazingly well constructed stand for the price going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these great product i am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all but it is a great stand for my studio practice kit being honest don t know how it would be for a gigging drummer but for what i am using it for more than does the job at sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic would need a heavier base for use with a boom this mic stand is solid and a good value but it s a one trick pony the picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect the stand comes with threads and does not come with an adapter not a huge deal if you re using a standard mic clip the height is about inches total and i m using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port if you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop i d highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from on stage i have one of those too but it was too tall even at it s shortest setting to mic my drum port but the adjustable height is very handy this is a nice microphone stand i have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems i would purchase this again it s sturdy and gets the job done tuner works as it should almost a little too precisely it s pretty sensitive the metronome will drive you crazy it has various beats which is a nice touch but the sounds are horrible think of the most sterile electronic clicks beeps you can and then add nails on chalkboard for good measure there are much better sounding metronomes out there i bought this korg for the tuner function and that s about all i ll use it for this is just what i needed to get rid of three or four large ac adapters great little kit for anyone with a pedal floor board these patch cords work like a champ i use them with my pedal board and haven t any issues with signal quality they give some versatility in their length i can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much the colors well ok they re a little odd but for the price i dealt with it this is a great deal for two microphone stands they are well constructed and are very flexible can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand several adjustment areas allow the perfect height positioning these should last a long time as long as they re not abused cool little light but three minor gripes the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy and the light is a little on the dim side but i think it ll work well overall and i like the fact that it s so compact and portable i needed a new stand for my home studio so i thought i was cutting corners when i purchased this one as it turns out this stand is practically indistinguishable from mybelmonte orchestra stand deluxein construction and material quality that stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review the stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians and is stable enough to use outside the rest tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments in fact i have attached analeratec universal tablet mountto hold an ipad with sufficient room left over for a page copy of thethe new real book volume and it holds those rock steady another feature that i like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand s footprint are not problems bottom line this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price i am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever i need another stand this is the model i will purchase
1062	i bought this one to replace a shure it s a big step up from that one i am pleased with it the old one had a lot of handling noise this one has a little but it is very good for the money i paid for it my next one will be an sm but that will be awhile from now i m very happy with this pg update december the handling noise is definitely something to consider it would keep me from buying another one of these other mics i own don t have this problem to this degree used the s for years but thought i would give these a try fuller sound with the s buti cannot bend them like the s i have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety s for rhythm and finger style s for lead get the packs of single s and s too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set love it makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy quiet power supply lots of cables and end caps and adapters for what you d pay for a single power adapter it s nice not having to dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play about the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters but i m sure you can find them somewhere good quality and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply my band was playing out one night i use an amp stand that was on the stage i really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve it s sound and decided i had to have one i started searching around and found this product the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen the musician s gear stand does everything i needed it to it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble it s light weight portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to lbs i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier lbs or less i ve owned many tuners through the years and i keep coming back to this one buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point
1063	i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick my guitar would probably not be happy without it the cloth that comes with the product is a high quality polishing cloth but some idiot thought it was best to package it stuck to the bottle with a glue button that leaves glue stuck to the cloth this glue is only removable after a expensive bath using goo gone or similar glue dissolving solution then washing with warm soapy water by hand and rinsing thoroughly in clear clean running water until all soap is removed then hanging the cloth up to air dry preferably outdoors in the sunshine if you have that available the cloth is so nice it is worth the time consuming and correct method of cleaning but is not why you buy a product that is supposed to clean and polish in the first place somebody better redesign the packaging for this product as the gibson cleaner polish is first rate and puts a high lustrous shine on the guitar surface which comes out bright dry and hard almost like having used a high quality paste wax but without residue very good stuff very irresponsible packaging for the convenience of the factory i assume but without forethought to the customer s needs this system works great i have a taylor ce and two other guitars i use these on very simple and works great i ve used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars my thumb nail can t pluck the strings when i damp them with the heel of my hand these are adequate in the sense that you can strike the strings with them and they stay on they have a dullish sound compared to my favorite the long gone national clear thumb pick or the current dunlop clear i like the sound of the ernie ball thin celluloid picks but they aren t strong enough to grip my thumb the major problem with these is they aren t large they re like most other brands medium my thumbs aren t tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average these picks cut off the circulation in my thumb if i use them for more than fifteen minutes or so i think i could brighten up the sound by sanding them down but that s a lot of work for something this cheap don t buy these if you have a large thumb if you like a less bright sound and some people do and have a medium sized thumb these might work well for you good cutter for guitar strings and will take care of most electrical wire sizes too handel is very comfortable too if you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new martin guitar this is a must have product i didn t want to have a hole drilled in a new martin guitar so this worked fine wit the martin leather straps actually i bought two of them it is a star product
1064	i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks obviously they weren t they re as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but it s still not too bad i have multiple guitars for different styles i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads good tone good sustain and they stay in tune i play gigs a week on average and practice everyday these strings get a workout and i change strings when i start to lose sustain that s why i buy the packs so i always have spare sets on hand most comfortable picks only complaint is that i would like four in a pack if you use all four fingers buy two sets put this on a gibson j it did increase the bass ok as that s not a j s strength but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have also took off a little of the finish on the sound hole when i removed it tried it on a martin d nope the bass got muddier which is definitely the wrong way to go with a martin at this point was going to return it but finally tried it on a small body now this worked great louder focused and projects much better almost resonator like fantastic for slide or capo d high that s it s home now so an o port can help a guitar that needs help a small body or cheap guitar in my sample of it made high end guitars sound worse if you can t afford a better guitar may be worth a try but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at sound hole
1065	nuff said works great latest purchace is used as a trigger on my drum machineused the coda kick pedaltrigger a boss sound moduleplay it all the timealso use one on my vocalist and eff mute and chan change like the option of nc or no saved my gig just tonight when one of my midi controllers lost it mind an needed no instead of normal nc this is not a top tier condenser mic but it is well worth the dollar price tag it has different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch the carrying case is also nice do not expect this to be mxl or even behringer b quality but it s still better than no condenser and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic ing i bought this as i had already purchased tow other joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was about this phaser is perfect i do not use a dramatic effect more or an evh setting for leads this pedal is sounding like the mxr i never give anything a this is a a great phase pedal great tone and a great price i am done thinking a good pedal must cost and above this was like and sounds awesome works amazingly well is very precise and easy to handle i have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes not so this one it is a great reliable tuner
1066	great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the p s i don t know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue i tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised i tend to have sweaty hands and my guitar strings get a lot of crud on them and then eventually rust although i have learned now to wipe them down each time i play they still deteriorate pretty quickly and it s a pain when i wipe them down with a cloth they leave black streaks of crud on the cloth the elixirs are not as bright as other strings when you first put them on that is true however other strings lose their brightness after just a few hours of playing so i don t see this as a major disadvantage the advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them when i wipe them down there s nothing on the cloth i ve even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully so for a player like me these are a godsend i don t detect any loss of tone they are a bit slippery and some people have reported having trouble because of this but it s fine for me definitely they re worth a try although they re twice as expensive as regular strings they ll last longer so they re worth checking out ernie ball makes titanium coated strings that i m interested in trying out and there are some other brands too i m pretty new to using mics and pa systems but have used dynamic mics in the past recreationally this condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic i was surprised when i took it out of the box it is as good looking in person as in the pictures three things for the benefit of other newbs i learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you re going to use this for vocals since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it this has a cardioid pickup pattern you don t sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic this should stand straight up on a mic stand paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it it requires phantom power you need a pa that provides v power to use it when i first used this mic i tried singing into the end of it and couldn t hear myself very well later in the evening i was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that i had to back away about a foot from the mic then i remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand paying attention to the orientation of the mic it was so sensitive that i really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals i have a rainsong ws acoustic electric guitar i was playing and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly other musicians were impressed by it as well i payed just under a for it which i think is a great value for this product
1067	had to return the first one second is holding it s own just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic spot on when used correctly inline with cables sorry fender this one is just a waste of money get something better that doesn t twist up an ravel into knots i m not one to use picks much so when i do i prefer a light pick i will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because will last a very long time it is fun to share for those needing a light pick go for these recommended the mustang was a great buy for another great fender product it has more bells and whistles than i can mention but it s sophistication is lost on me i was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the mustang it seemed that s all i was getting great little amp just not for me this is my first amp which i am using with my new applause ae rrb acoustic electric guitar also purchased from amazon the guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp my only complaint is that as a first time amp owner user i needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with no paperwork at all not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit i received i downloaded the users manual from the pyle website but it was also not much help but just by trying different settings i have managed to find what for me is the sweet spot for my guitar when paired with this amp very happy with the amp and also happy that i spent the extra few dollars to get the amp rather than the amp version
1068	i m a pro cheapo and i hated this thing they re noisy and the cables feel really cheap gummy like drop few more bucks and get something else love that i didn t have to assemble this stand just had to unfold it was easy to adjust and is very stable it s nice to be able to sit down at keyboard without having to worry about bumping it also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use comes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple i thought it was my jack for a while then i noticed it wouldn t stay in any pedal there is no click assuring that the cable is in place and there s a reason for that it isn t slips right out of every pedal i have not reliable first off this is a overdrive pedal with a mosfet circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion the pedal is very good at this there are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp this is on par with the warm tone of another ehx pedal the big muff fuzz the tone function is kindof useless to me i like to keep it on with the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh don t let that keep you from checking this hot rod out i love mine its a keeper
1069	i play my i pod through a small guitar amp great way to wake up the kids works perfectly for the purpose keep in mind small end for i pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else these come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand they do need v phanom power from your board or a mic amp i m using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which i will review in more detail later the vdc comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which i will review as a set if you do stereo recording you can t go wrong with these their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear it sounds great and setup outside with db of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away rain drops comming down and sounds you never would hear note never get these wet you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain you will need xlr cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar but you already know that i ve had behringer mikes before and currently have a couple of xm s which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm s i saw this three pack of s for in a hard case and couldn t believe it i hooked them up right beside the s and while there is a little difference it s not much the has a little more high end but it s easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass the presence is also boosted a little on the meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback for now i m using the matched s as the main mikes for our vocalists and keeping the older s as backups i bought the of these for less than the price of one sm although the shure and the b is better the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for i can afford to buy another pack for complete backup a wise choice for the budget conscious this arrived a week sooner then expected i am very happy with this bag my fender lh san miguel acoustic guitar fits perfectly it is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry wow this thing is fun to play with this is my first delay pedal so i cant compare it with others but im so happy that i bought it ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day you can tweak the echo in s of different ways the case seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last quite a while as long as i dont get over zelous and stomp on it too hard im very happy with this product and im becoming a real fan of behringer products
1070	i heard about these from a friend several years back i teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services these strings allow me to keep on keepin on for several weeks at a time even with constant usage i wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions i just received the case today the soonest delivery day on the estimation range a plus there now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim threading and basic locks keys included are gold toned instead of silver toned pictured but that doesn t mean diddly squat to me plush interior with a small yet roomy compartment located under the neck i am primarily a string banjo player but decided to casually play around with the mandolin and so i figured i had better get a hard case for possible long time storage my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before i started getting serious with it and boy not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces this case will definitely do the trick excellent value additional note there is a bit of extra play around the peg head i have an rover mandolin i can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough some peg snapping may occur but again for simple storage protection its a non issue not sure why behringer gets a bad rep this is compact works as advertised is affordable and an all around handy thing for the musician well built solid construction zero complaints the e bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar great tool great for carrying with you works as it should good price i would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot
1071	it can hold the weight of any of my guitars its easy to install and i guess its cheap it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter pretty basic strap but durable and works for me the only thing i noticed is i think that one of the end pieces was attached with the stitching on the wrong side but it s just a picky detail i did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these i just got done stringing them and they sound great i think these will be what i play from now on works as advertised for my purpose it is in front of a computer speaker set with woofer for use on a vizio tv as a sound system works fine i have other behringer gear and it always works the best non rackmount reverb i have ever had so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb excellence once again from tc i ve been using ableton for years and it never crashes i connected this interface with live on windows i set my default playback and recording device as line out scarlett i usb and set it as my default device it crashes every time in ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on youtube sometimes i hears pops and clicks after minutes and have to reset the asio all driver which is the same issue with my audio technica at usb mic my computer is an amd system and i have used my at usb on a dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item i bough for my primo and he really loves it
1072	recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party upon installation and testing the unit blew a fuse going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing if not i ll be returning mine will update update radio shack carries the correct fuses for this unit upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected leaks a bit while using so dont stand under it but most on these things leak anyway i got this to use on an old mac computer to allow me to use some equipment that needed more than a line level output it works great for that haven t used it for anything else though so cant comment there seems sturdy and well made as well i didn t know when i ordered these mic stands that they were on stage stands they are fully adjustable great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics excellent quality i m very happy with this set
1073	probably the best kapo out on the market very high quality and a sleek look easy to use what more could you want good picks great feel and brings out sound loudly mostly for electrics i prefer the lighter sound of the acoustic but these work very well with my friends electric fender on stage xcg tubular guitar stand with velveteen padding and security is very helpful tool for any guitarist i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain recommend it i already had the other two snarks and then i borrowed this version in a shop from another patron the readout is cool makes me feel good inside to look at it
1074	doe s not stay on to well moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned i ve purchased other types but i keep coming back to this one for the it s the best buy in my opinion if you buy the keyboard you re going to need the power adaptor sucks that yamaha runs this scam of not supplying the power cord and making you buy it separate but i suppose the nickle and dimes really add up for them power cord fine yamaha shady i like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere i use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar the right angle is nice because it s low profile and fits perfectly on my board even when i put it in it s travel case everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem not much to say about a xlr cable it works average quality does the job no problems good price came quickly through prime i bought these light picks because of the price they work good if your strumming some light rhythms but they tend to be weak and break if your strumming a fast song i guess that s to be expected for a light pick i am the kind of guy that fixes everything with duct tape and when the item is more tape than product i go to a pawn shop and buy something used and start the process again i saw this case and thought bucks and it s for my favorite guitar so i purchased it days later it was sitting at my back door and i didn t have to pay shipping this thing is a beauty plush interior hardware looks great and good quality does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type deep storage pocket and more my string fits in it w room to spare and its case is running out of room to tape so i guess i ll be purchasing another soon
1075	i didn t know a little battery powered amp could sound so good it sounds just as good if not better than my roland cube of course without the effects and such but still a great little amp for practice and a little gig with family and friends puts out pretty good power for a little w has a great sound in my opinion easily the best quality capo for it s price looks great on any guitar i came across shubb a few months back when my capo finally gave out after years i bought the c stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars but i had to adjust it any time i went to use it on my les paul which has a s neck and fretboard ordered off of amazon and it shipped the same day i just got it in the mail yesterday and it snapped right on the lp with a firm click i didn t even have to adjust it it looks amazing in use and is just the best and simplest design you know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what don t forget to remove it when you guitar is resting it s easy to forget it s there forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos this never effects my fret thumb or forefinger exactly what i was looking for in a capo i will have these for a long time and i m a shubb guy from this day forward my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special harps i guess i should have paid attention to the other and star ratings these harps have no volume don t waste your money on them i guess the only thing worth having is the case but the case has no handles or carry strap i said the case had no handle well i take that back there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside this will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too the rhythm machine has rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo it is not perfect as it has no on off switch it reverts to default mode when you power it up it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats it only cost around so perfection should not be expected for practice and the home studio it is great first off this is a overdrive pedal with a mosfet circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion the pedal is very good at this there are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp this is on par with the warm tone of another ehx pedal the big muff fuzz the tone function is kindof useless to me i like to keep it on with the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh don t let that keep you from checking this hot rod out i love mine its a keeper
1076	great replacement string for your ukulele great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku i got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin do they sound as good as a k gibson f not hardly do they sound good for a dollar chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find actually yeah they do this is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so i wouldn t worry about that when you get it the action is likely to be high and if you can t lower the bridge enough with the wheels it s easy enough to sand some off the bottom also like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something decent strings don t cost very much depending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable after you fix the bridge and strings little instrument the hardware isn t the best and the tuners suck but hey if you re just starting out tuning is part of the game for and i ve seen new ones bucks less from time to time it s worth the investment you can spend more on dinner and a movie and after you ate and watched the flick it s gone with the money spent here you ll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening my year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it so far so good it s been holding up well btw if breaks you and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin been there since you re here reading this that means you re on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going after that you can find many good books cds dvds that will help you along even further and one day you ll get a better instrument i m actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so i don t take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever and if i get cold and run out of wood these are almost cheap enough to burn one thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these if you go to certain online classifieds cl coughcoughcough you ll notice people ask bucks or more for these sometimes over used same with pawnshops and those people know what these cost new this is one of the few cases where i d buy new over used if you decide to sell it and as long as it s not in pieces it ll still bring bucks used so you won t be out much but really it s a good servicable instrument with a little work but if you re lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it again though not that big a deal to fix if it s not oh as stated elsewhere these don t have trussrods that s not bad in itself you d be surprised how many mandolins didn t have them years ago and alot of them are still around even from some big makers if the neck warps in a year or two no big deal you got your moneys worth mines been kicking around for awhile and the last year a year old at the time has been beating on it and i can still pick it up tune it and play it this is a nice strap it s kinda hard to get on the st time because it s stiff that turned out to be good good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat it would be sad if your axe fell in your soup this guitar tuner is such a great and useful tool it teaches chords and got me to play my guitar better in less than one day thanks austin garcia my kids were excited to split this pack of picks since there were two of each in the pack they didn t have to argue over who got which pick these are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing i think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the s and s i recently ordered this ukulele and others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as i wanted to give them a few options okina uk soprano ukulele with rosewood fingerboard naturaldiamond head du ukulele naturalmahalo u or painted economy soprano ukulele orange lanikai lu soprano ukulelekala ka s mahogany soprano ukulelethe okina diamond head and mahalo were all under at the time and within price of each other of the three i thought that the mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality the okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own and year old ukuleles which had the original strings a string upgrade to aquila strings helped significantly but even then the okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level the diamond head and mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice for this price little gig bag incidentally what the mahalo product description says is a color matching brown gigbag ended up being black but black is pretty standard gig bag color the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the diamond head s that being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the mahalo since it s so near the same price compared to the diamond head and has better strings already installed i ve also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you i was hesitant at first but this did the job as a guitar player i recently march started to play the uke i bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument these string play good and stay in tune pretty well i will buy again this is the nd tuner like this that i have purchased it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar the battery lasts a long time as well which is not true with all little tuners like this one all in all i am very happy with this purchase small price to pay to be in tune i would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon t leave home without itbut take and extra button battery but i keep thinking it is going to interfere with tuning at the nutwill be trying to get more use in been using the snark tuners for while now functions perfectly only problem i have is it is small enough that i have trouble finding it sometime so i have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same i wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin and this works great the arms are adjustable so the instrument won t rest on the pegs the foam is good and the hardware is included plus the price is great bought because cheap and trying to keep my electric guitar strings in good shape if i decide to pick it up again very nice classical guitar strap i have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons don t expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar this is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it it will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it this is the way this type of strap is made to work and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested holds my cordoba in position perfectly i have three uku soprano concert love the best and a tenor this brand of strings rocks enjoy this is so darn cool it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune and it works on so many instruments
1077	the nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but on the negative side i replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings this was my first acoustic guitar and i ve received some surprised looks about its tone and play ability both from from my luthier who used to be a tech at martin to a couple pro players with years respectively under their belts it s light comfortable well made has a fast neck and is just marvelous in every way for a beginner like myself wonderfully priced i was expecting to be disappointed but didn t want to invest in a new hobby until i was sure i d stick with it it s possible that i just lucked out with a good one after a year of playing my jasmine i have no urge to upgrade to anything else will confess that i d like a string but that s another animal i am too new and inexperienced with acoustics to be able to really define the sonic quality of this guitar compared to more expensive models i m more of an electric guy but for me in my ignorant state it s stars without hesitation i did need to have it set up however and the stock strings on mine were in poor condition don t recall if i purchased it on amazon in any event a trip to the luthier with new strings and it felt like a guitar far in excess of it has stayed in tune quite nicely and i often change tunings standard mostly eb occasional full step down open d g and others no fret buzz and i just love the feel of the neck i do wish the body was a tad thinner as i have shoulder problems but i m sure a thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass and richness nice and light however and perfect for carrying on your back by the way i have the model with the black pickguard the one pictured looks similar in every other way quite sure it s the same model i purchased this for my daughter who is she is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar i bought her this bag has plenty of storage offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly i am going to purchase another one for my guitar the quality and feel of this tuner is very good tuning the guitar is really easy just put the batteries in it comes with aaa batteries and press the red button to turn it on then pluck the strings this is my first tuner and its great already it s very portable this mic is absolutely awesome it looks and feels so high quality the sound is stunning it could be a tiny bit better for the price but i m absolutely pleased with it overall best mic in this price range by far
1078	it s a capo nice fit yet sometimes i wonder if it fits too tightly as when i use it and of course the strings are tighter sometimes i feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight yet it is a capo structured very well ok so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists i ve been playing for about years now and have used many different brands an types of pick there is no perfect pick for everything depending on what your playing and your playing style you ll want to choose different thickness and materials however i have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick my hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor i also really like the nylon material it produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar i like the playability of the mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues i keep a stack of mm for a more raw folk like sound in any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be you get a speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around this is by far the best practice amp i have found in the past years and i owna butt load of new amps i have actually upgraded to a champion but still use this amp as much as the don t even think about it this is one of the best under practice amps unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp and in that case you should look elsewhere as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time as an addendum i would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras i have read from other reviewers i have a few of these amps so just for the heck of it i put in a celestion g greenback which costs more than the r and was very disappointed withthe results this amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now but can still be had new for under if you just do an internet search as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard however if used as a fuzz pedal instead it truly shines since this is really what it is does it have distortion yes is it valuable as such not in my opinion it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that another gripe i have is the volt slot most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply not so with this pedal you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries which sux imo especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain anyways while this is fun to play with you should definitely consider the sound you are going for if you prefer to play a more grungy or s era metal then this will work for you for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere imo i bought a pedal board and needed power and wires bought this kit it is just super the one spot provides the power needed the wiring is just right for the pedals i ve installed this is a great set all you ll need to get your pedal train wired and running i am very pleased with the quality of this stand it is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less it shipped on time and the packing was good it is lined and has a pouch for song books great price and great product if you are looking for a soft case this is a great option i have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a cable these are not cheap but they are priced much better than others and they work great no loss of tone through these cables if anything i had to do some eq adjusting because after using these i had a far greater signal volume and frequency response when i replaced my other patch cables with these i love them
1079	excellent product simple and practical design holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone if humidity levels in your area go below you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks put this on a gibson j it did increase the bass ok as that s not a j s strength but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have also took off a little of the finish on the sound hole when i removed it tried it on a martin d nope the bass got muddier which is definitely the wrong way to go with a martin at this point was going to return it but finally tried it on a small body now this worked great louder focused and projects much better almost resonator like fantastic for slide or capo d high that s it s home now so an o port can help a guitar that needs help a small body or cheap guitar in my sample of it made high end guitars sound worse if you can t afford a better guitar may be worth a try but be careful as it did chip off some finish on at sound hole i bought this guitar case for wife as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her gig bag soft case with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could she absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it it makes you think that this case should cost more but for the it is an awesome deal the case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her mic cable di box picks and tuner underneath the neck there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings you might pay more for a name brand case save some money for soemthing else an dget this case because it is a great deal we found nothing negative that we could say about it it also was packaged very well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick
1080	not easy to set up hard to tighten down works well enough as a filter once you get it placed i love a lot of danelectro products but not really this one i give it because it works as advertised the features are good true bypass requires a v wall plug and adjustments are good but here s my issue the distortion is not crunchy it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional it has no depth to it thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres but i play a lot of blues rock i ended up switching to a vintage tube overdrive by behringer not for me maybe for you these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable these are not x paper size they are about half sheet size
1081	all i can say is you should try a set of these elixir nanoweb bronze acoustic guitar strings for yourself you will not want to go back to any other set of strings i ve been using elixir strings for many years they have better feel sound and last longer than all other brands i ve used playing guitar elixir has excellent quality control too i ve never had a problem i love my hd got it a while back but have just started to explore it s capabilities sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website there are so many options i spend hours just experimenting and trying different things the possibilities are endless wonderful i love it am sure you will too enjoy having played guitar for years i have tried and used many many capos back in the day it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic it didn t work very well but it is what was available to me later some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place and in tune as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar without doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar s neck many good capos have been made until now perhaps the best options have been g which fails in its softness that allows strings to slip and schubb which unfortunately snaps into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument this new ns tri action capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively designed by ned steinberger the ns the tri action works on a trigger spring lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck fits perfectly on the first attempt holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar both the g s and the schubbs are better known more commonly used and more expensive this is one of those rare instances where what you get is not what you pay for d addario the famous string maker that produces the planet waves line of guitar accessories has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos any guitar player who has gone from one to the other capo over time searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time will find this new capo from planet waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six string guitar it arrived i plugged it in already had a battery in it both knobs at o clock toggle in middle didn t change the internal switches bam guitar sounds alive no more weak notes the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power no compressor pumping very minimal noise compressors by nature are noisy it just make the guitar sound better even and stronger compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound this pedal has been optimized for guitar you can tell it is high quality if you play crystal clear you have to have this pedal driven full distortion it adds sustain im sold now i may just have to get the sl drive also by xotic look it up on youtube don t get me wrong the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable there s a little more brightness to the output they are a little more long lasting and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal xl this is a good string but it looks like the going rate on these strings will be bucks a set i can get three sets of regular excellent xl strings for that money and if the nyxl lasted times as long then they d be worthwhile but i ve been able to try them twice now and they don t last times as long great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced i was looking forward to trying these as i ve loved this company s product since day one but i think they ve messed around with the gauge slapped a meaningless hd tag on and added a few bucks to the price more profit in someone s pocket for marketing jargon i have a smaller bodied guitar so these should have by their claim given me better balance but imho the opposite happened the bottom dropped out the top end stopped sizzling and the middle strings totally took over when i strum with a pick when i play with fingers it s better but not worth spending more money on than the normal s i ve been using which i think i liked a lot better it s possible that these work great on the taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for color me skeptical but i d say if you re happy with what you have you need not try these again long time user and big fan but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly hd moniker no thanks
1082	i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar metallic silver sizeand what a difference in sound these strings seriously rock i also use d addario strings on my ukulele and i ve had great luck with those they withstand a lot of play and i don t have to replace them often the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder definitely recommended it is fine strings i couldn t really find difference between martin m maybe its just me i expected more than that its just regular strings i bought this to replace the inexpensive musedo t tuner that came bundled with my kala ka s ukulele the snark sn is much more accurate but its lcd display is not very bright and has a narrow field of view yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference i wish it were brighter and easier to see still it s a very good tuner overall i was excited with how easy it was to set up and it makes my music room look so much better with guitars hanging up instead of just sitting on the floor or on stands i liked this tuner the look the size the ease of use the quality performance until it died i think what happened is i just left it on too long my problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it since it died that first time it doesn t seem to perform the same i also haven t really paid much attention to it since it died because i sent another similar tuner in for replacement and i got an acoustic guitar that has an on board tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitar i wouldn t recommend against this product just remember to hold the power button to turn it off
1083	a long time planet waves user i trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards imho it is not the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip i like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar and into the amp at the other end the actual cable is horrible it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should e g like my old planet waves cables do they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre very disappointing purchase as a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal holy grail of guitar picks i am no exception dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya the dollar picks you name it i ve tried it even nail picking on metal strings now if you are new to the perfect pick quest you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your grail different however if you play a light metal string acoustic my main is an aria af tenor guitar check out these dunlops nylons even within the dunlop line i have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing even the dunlop nylon max grip of the same gage didn t acoustically perform quite the same would i try another pick if the chance was presented sure most of us would since the quest for the holy grail never truly ends but until then dunlop s nylon is without hesitation the closest thing i have gotten to pick perfection this kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard it s got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control when i got it i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal as far as a cv controler it sucks at that too why it squeaks as you move it after minutes use right out of the box behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name although only conceived in germany it s a direct copy of the yamaha fc and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares i m betting the extra dollars will be well worth it also you may say who cares if it squeaks a little well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a wah effect at low volume in the studio good luck if you buy it the dunlop neck cradle is well designed and firmly supports the neck of any guitar it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze buy one and i am sure you will like it as well as i overall as with most zoom products this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by it s competition in it s price category except for perhaps the olympus ls which is cheaper but the zoom has a ton more features build quality is good features are good the only unit in it s price range to have combi xlr trs inputs and it records to a high quality however i think zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it the best digital recorder under a grand and making it a great usb digital interface instead of spending money on the track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works o k but is much more easily realized in a simple digital track recorder e g a tascam pocketstudio the manual is a farse in japanese english translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit although it s fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices i gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus but the unit is still a little fiddly to operate in advanced modes my last comment is in regards to the h n as a usb interface i have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface first of all it is only bit and i can only get it to work with mme drivers i have read that there are some asio drivers available for windows but i use xp i may try to use asio all but it is still only bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work there is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a daw software i have only tried it with cakewalk sonar i had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly i can t seeing it being of much use in this regard however overall the unit is stellar and i highly recommend it ps i read some folks having issues with line inputs e g recording a stereo mix from a mixer i personally don t see the problem the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types if it is not working for your situation one can always use a trs hi z unbalanced to xlr low z balanced converter available at radio shack for around bucks i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr which has a flawless basic looper built in but only seconds record and no undo i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn t need to carry a power adapter along the factory battery lasted about hour the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about minutes i started recording a loop with another rd fresh battery tested v with a multimeter and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording suggesting that it was faulty the lights started coming on and off randomly record undo all three together then off then undo on then all three on etc etc the first time i used the jamman xt with the factory battery it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything so i know it was not my poor technique the main problem was that it didn t matter how hard i tried even if i did a manual fade out there was always a gap of about seconds between the end of the loop and the start this makes the unit useless also it is poorly conceived in that to replace the battery you have to take out screws exposing the delicate printed circuit board the potential for damage here is very high also replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible read inevitable damage i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one it s going back to the store where i purchased it
1084	i had done a fair amount of research on banjos before i bought this it has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well yes there many banjos and some with more frills there is no indication of where this banjo was made but the quality is top notch i am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely i see no flaws on my banjo i did not have the problem with the th string machine being to tight as others i bought mine from the same place it ships if you buy it at amazon best was bucks cheaper with free shipping if i could give it more than stars i would i can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy i also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck that is not a issue either while i am expert on banjo i would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either a keeper for sure with a twang twing twong nothing wrong gotta love these strings that just wanna sing wonderful price and great product buy it love mine and have recommended to every musician i know works great and love the colorful display i have purchased about of these in the past years i have found no major issues with any of them expect to do a small amount of fretwork such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends checking the frets for crowns filing those down and polishing the frets as with any neck even the high dollar ones the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up they come unfinished but well sanded i sand a bit extra but one could spray it out of the box i like to use coats of amber and to coats of clear lacquer satin or semi gloss none of these are select quarter sawn wood but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument
1085	i ve been using these for about weeks now they are strong but flexible and don t seem to develop kinks or bending habits if you roll them up the proper way i ve seen and used some better cables but not at this price point and i ve certainly seen quite a few worse this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion accurate little accessory only works with guitars it seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar i don t know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments or for uses other than tuning constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp it is not nearly as heavy as i would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together controlsthe iii comes with a button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly you can expand to add an optional button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets the controls are intuitive and easy to use it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs comparing to other amps the fender gdec does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line vox and peavy have offered in the past all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects but how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them line offers tons of sounds most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what i find with line is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little inch champ tons of character and tone you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model think the jimi blues cd the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing fender bassman wow you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end with some singing highs deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps they are all bold and in your face just play one acdc riff into the s amp and you ll recognize the sound as far as the vintage tones go i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good i was wrong the s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model this is certainly your metallica amp the metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones you can have one guy who sets all presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash it is limitless i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar they all sound very cool on this amp the classic vibe s strat really impresses me through this amp so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound i am really loving it this amp can play really really loud with it s watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes i have kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse the system is super easy to use and store on your amp as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well but you will find some gems too i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later the final wordi am a father of who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones i hate overprocessed guitar tones this amp is perfect for me perfect the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased i have a strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it there is no better modeling amp for my needs i needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass these things work really great i love them
1086	i just put this on my dot hollowbody it s a big heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job i like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it the price was great had the gibson name on it and was a great value stars i have one of these in every one of my guitar cases you never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper cutter winder and pin puller gets the job done and it is inexpensive mine came flattened in a little box i wasn t happy that its form was deformed well in a few days it popped back into shape so i didn t have to ship it back a good sign i am using it for both some music and computer stuff the bag is well made considering its price you cannot even get a backpack for this price i love its depth a number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded this is a solid depth and cozy padding around it for protection be sure to check out all the dimensions though its very long i was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it i think i saw micro and thought shorter not only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack i m thinking of getting another because of this the only minus is that i wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder paper slot but these are just wish list items finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited lucky this is a good option i bought this set mainly because i wanted a cheap micro fiber cloth to polish off my guitars for the price of just a microfiber cloth this set throws in a polish the cloth is just what i wanted it is soft and i feel good rubbing it on my instrument i wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear the polish is just that it is works to bring out a shine but it is not a cleaner you also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string friendly i ve tried several different strings on electric and ernie ball slinkys are the only ones i really trust on all of my guitars the fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus but they sound great and are far less prone to breakage than other brands i have tried the s are super fast and easy to bend but i ve started using s more often on my strats which creates an even more robust sound they re an industry standard for a reason you don t need dollar strings in my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself i attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually i fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history i just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty just be sure to buy thekorg cm l clip on contact microphone for tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing picks are one of those items in which taste is of what decides if it works for each or not that being said i have to admit that these picks are very high quality the design is really pragmatic and effective i recently was introduced to these by a student of mine and i have to say for the first time in years i changed my picks i used dunlop made with lexan material and those i found to be perfect until these came along sometimes change is good we just need to be open to it these feel very good but they wear off quite quickly so not pick taping and easy with the struming also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical
1087	this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar i sing worship praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely i don t think it is the same as an sm but it is exactly what i need built to last and it is a shure this rack stand is made up of a heavy steel and welded together very well i received my rack stand yesterday and put it together in under minutes my audio equipment mounted easily with the included mounting screws and everything looks great and i don t have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over it is very sturdy and very stable i recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to audio or networking devices i will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once i fill this one up i will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly just got this it is my first pedal of any sort it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with i just plug in my headphones and i am off in my own world when i play i can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever i want or at least get close to what i want i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didn t can t say i ve tried all of the capos in the world but i ve had my share of the different designs first i had the bungee cord type then i had the snap on type then i had the different capos designed for acoustic or classical or electrical this one by far evolved from good design the bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly the top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings the spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension the design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck all of the others i have tried use a spring that could pop out one actually did and the entire capo came apart this one even has a pick holder built in it is light weight just the right size i highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar d addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around i ve used their strings for electric acoustic bass electric and acoustic guitar irish bazouki mandolin irish tenor banjo string banjo even used their octave mandolin strings on my serbian brach always with stellar results when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldn t be hype i was right i strung my guitar with these about weeks ago have probably played the guitar or so hours at gigs and in the studio i ve never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of minute sets but these did and i was sober so it wasn t just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when i played it of course that wouldn t mean a thing if they didn t feel good on the fingers they do like they were custom made for your guitar they were on my rickenbacker so i can t honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but i strongly suspect they would not only do they stay in tune but weeks later they still sound crisp new i m going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good i usually change my strings every other week when i m playing regularly so i m already passed my regular limit i may update this review in a month or so when i know how long they lasted most highly recommended
1088	hosa makes good stuff this is no exception i ve trusted them for years i can t think if a single hosa cable i ve owned that s failed i purchased several of thes fender mini stands because i don t have a lot of sapce for my guitars and i fold these up and stick them in my closet when need i don t need them for approx ten bucks you can t go wrong they work as well as bulkier more expensive stands this tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tune it is good deal for the money these seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which i will appreciate for a long while rock on
1089	this is the one you want it s a timeless classic built like a tank worth every penny an investment in your musical future i just finished installing of these and couldn t be any happier with the product it is a sturdily built product with everything you need for installation i didn t think this was possible but i actually found a product made in the usa i will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows i did not have the mis matching color issue that others commented on all i did was contact the seller in my case brook mays music and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all are going on the same wall they were extrememly responsive even sending two emails concerning my request basically saying they would do their best but no promises well brook mays came through for me i received very quickly i might add of these that matched perfectly i will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again another great experience purchasing items through the amazon site i bought this snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele i ve been using a blue snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it i thought she needed a snark of her own and it works like a charm i like the chromatic aspect of it because you can tune your strings to any pitch other than concert pitch sometimes we like to go lower and sometime a whole or half step higher it s beautiful to look at clips on the head of the instrument with soft rubber feet and truly does an excellent job of tuning i teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one i go to the most and i have a lot of different tuners i rarely use any of my other tuners anymore relying mostly on the snarks that i have it uses a cr button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time i use my snark at least times a day either tuning my instruments or my students what i really love about these types of tuners is that you can talk while tuning since it feels the vibrations of the string instead of listening to it it will tune practically anywhere loud rooms etc and tune accurately wow for the size this is amazing plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper nothing else to say it s great if you re in the market for one get it
1090	nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time one of my favorite picks i ve tried for electric don t enjoy them as much on acoustic i use mediums but bought these for my nephews takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar always love these strings this kid has not changed his strings in years so i thought i would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible i opened the package for the first time and didn t think much of it but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job obviously cardboard isn t going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths to heavy it doesn t stay where you need it slips down becuase of wieght get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar i bought it for my violin i was a bit reluctant because i uses vibrations to tune and i was hoping not to get something useless its been great so far its easy to use i clip it on my violin and tune i like to keep it on while i play to make sure i have my fingers in the correct spot as it shows the note i m playing i had the sn guitar tuner this one the sn is actually for all instruments if i m not mistaken and it works great never fails i love the red the swivel head the green red lights when tuning just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it the best non rackmount reverb i have ever had so many options clean transparent and whisper quiet this is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain the toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb excellence once again from tc
1091	i love this capo better than any i have seen or used great quality and price you wont go wrong with this capo my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it it s been in heavy use hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and i don t think we ve even had to replace the batteries yet it s got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust we tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn t loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust this one is great snark tuners are great since i ve bought snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way i ve had some for years that i still use today without ever changing batteries or anything they are great and last forever this one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine tune your instrument it have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played really nice piece of equipment for a small price
1092	so while i got this for my soprano ukulele they fit fine not much to say really other then they are good strings and work extremely easy to use tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly have used it several times and first battery still has juice
1093	i love these picks i buy tons of them all the time if you are like me and prefer to just strum tunes on your acoustic then these are the picks for you i prefer thin picks for basic strumming as i am a beginner guitarist and they are more forgiving have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time attaches to my audio interface no cable switching didn t need the sophistication of other mixers costing x as much fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording well it s made nicely but output is not strong sensitivity brings notes together on the bright side but there s little ciean sustain i m going to work with it more that s compressor s i am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product i have been playing professionaly for more than years and in that time have gone through many amps guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts the great ones i have kept over the years ibanez ts and ts mxr compressor etc and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesn t take up much stage room the one item that i didn t have in a pedal form was a good reverb i have had great success with other behringer rack products digital reverb echo eq s patch panels and other home studio stuff the dr was my first behringer pedal i think it works great i have had it for about months and have used it almost every weekend since i got it to play jobs with my band often several nights a week it has given me no problem i can t speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a one spot multi ac adapter i bought this stand after trying two others that didn t work well this one is very adjustable and stays put i use this in my home studio and i can place it so it comes up right under my mic boom just off to the side of microphone so when you are doing a vocal you don t have to look down or move you head away from the mic i ll be buying two more run this into my laptop from a behringer fx mixer windows didnt need to install any drivers it was plug n play reaper picks it up immediately just arm the track set level and record i will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting i found that others had the same issue i had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer click recording devices select my uca not internal microphone from the list click properties at the bottom of the sound window select the levels tab and reduce the level to around or to have an equal volume from themixer into windows and reaper until i did that every signal into reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothing i tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problem so far the behringer uca is working great and signal is clean noisy as any compressor but after using it i don t wanna go back to not having one for my setup i bought this unit for my son s edrums and because of the inputs rca mic instruments i plugged my guitar in channel mic in his edrums on rca and we re good to go not as loud as the or speakers of course but for small room this will do playing music on rca channel is also nice but you will need to adjust the eq to get a good highs and lows light weight and very portable
1094	stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time these hangers are easy to install just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business the stringed instrument becomes easily accessible and safe not much to say here strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player you need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style these are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years i replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping times a year the strings are great priced great and was on sale which made it even better there is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that s good too just exactly as stated this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand holds picks it is exactly what i wanted for a great price thanks editing this review to say that today i got a few thin picks and the thin picks do not hold in this mediums do great but the thin fall right out fine for me because i will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone works great keeps all my fretboards looking great even though i change strings frequently on my twelve acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever i play hard for several hours almost every day and i m always amazed at the crud that accumulates on the fretboards guess i ll have to stop eating cheetos while i m playing just kidding this oil breaks down the crud and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition no issues no problems only positive things to say about the oil i have owned my g th capo over a year now as far as i m concerned it beats all the others i ve owned in the past hands down so easy to use can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed i ve owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw the pots all still work without adding noise and in general the device does exactly what i need it to do you won t find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp mixer i use several behringer components in my set up e g my mixer pa speakers effects accessories etc including this pedal i have confidence in the behringer name and always feel like i m getting a good solid piece of equipment that i can rely on this pedal is no exception it s a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal i don t like to depend on battery power for any critical components if i don t have to so i also purchased the behringer psu sb power supply general purpose dc v power adaptor available on amazon along with this great price sturdily built great compressor effect awesome patch cables for your pedalboard they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks love planet waves gear when i got this i thought it was a cheap toy like thing but when i put it on my banjo it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else but easy to see when i needed it it s red when out of tune and green when in tune it does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned i love it when i am the only one using it unlike the clamp kind like the snark it s hard to share the clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to so between my husband and me using it i m afraid the thing will break i play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it
1095	works just fine great for little spaces between one pedal to another if there s more distance better use another type bue generally works fine and it s a good quality product clean signal no problems regular strings they work and they last they have a worm sound and i really like that and with my takamine they sound great these are thin they allow getting your pedals very close to each other and let you optimize your pedal board space i had other cables on my pedal boards i replaced everything with those it s a great pick holder but i m not fond of the sticky background something clip on would have been more useful the material it s made of is good and it holds the guitar the only things i don t like are each of the corners has a cap the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off the part at the bottom that looks like a u used to hold the guitar it spins it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one for the price it s worth it i guess if you just want to try it go for it that s what i got it for it sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals i would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal but for the price it s not too bad oh and the casing isn t like a wimpy plastic knife plastic it s pretty durable albeit don t throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps for the price i m really happy it s my first one i get and it s perfect i m learning how to use it and it s not as easy as you guys think i got it today in the mail and i already tried it it s really cheap product but it works really well i m really happy with it and it made me save several minutes to change my strings it is a good price works fine to connect my wha wha pedal to my ampli stars because nothing is perfect but i m happy with it so if you want to play just in your garage this is really good for the price i like it it s ok the sound is kind of a cold distortion if you like warm sounds you should see something else if you are like me that you love playing music this is a good buy it pretty much does what it s supposed to so you plug it and it s ready to use it s pretty fast and accurate for it s price light weight the only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the th string overall it s good enough to buy it well like everyone knows this is the copy of the boss but a lot cheaper than that it works just fine and i m happy with it anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal if you want more from a pedal the boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance havent used it yet seems like a nice pedal nice an lightweight clean has some nice rubber on the bottom lol haha okaaaaaay
1096	strings blend really well on my cheap jasmine guitar they improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit phosphor bronze were way too bright on the jasmine is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out they did nothing to help my over braced gibson j though phosphor bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap i normally buy d addario strings here i buy the or strings this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning when i first started on guitar i put electric ernie ball on my acoustic so i could handle the pain and keep learning then i went to d addario strings i wanted to try these since the under price is good they sound nice they don t sound as crisp as the d addario strings they sound more mellow and not as bold they are and i prefer those to the other strings out there i can t say i love them or i hate them i will probably stick with d addario since i don t find any difference in them i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon for the price i would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them i don t think they sound bad and if they do it did not cost much to test them enjoy i ordered with my new guitar these straps are quite flexible length wise so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn t get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position you will not be disappointed here bought to tune my bass works fine and at the this price it cant be beat highly recommend for budget tuner i just bought a new guitar and will be buying another one of these the price is great and it works very happy with this stand
1097	i have to say this little guy packs a punch and for bucks i just needed something i could plug into that was super portable and cheap also this works well with an iphone set up if you want to use some larger effects this little guy doesn t come with also this little guy doesn t gobble up volt batteries like other guitar gear tends to do the only minor flaw is it s made out of plastic so if you need something more durable maybe get a solid state amp the plugs into a wall outlet our buy two more of these they are only bucks this chromatic clip on tuner is the best of the best one cannot go without having one for the price i ve tuned violins guitars and ukelele s with it this is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without you can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments if you have it on the mic than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wish this little instrument tuner does everything for the cost you just cannot be without one i bought this for my acoustic bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo holds my bass guitars easily as well
1098	i bought the mm picks i would consider them medium thickness if you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness the mm is right for me i really like them good sized holder i placed it between the tuners it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time just enough tension to hold the picks not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them highly recommended i m giving this one stars with the caveat that you must get the silver aluminum one otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break the thermoplastic ones broke on me within months of use different ones until i got the silver one which has not had that problem every music store i go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones and they look in disbelief at me when i say they break but they did if i leave it on the guitar on a fret for or minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea the thing literally snaps and breaks into or pieces and goes airborne at high speed in pieces and could poke someone s eye out in a public performance freaky there s something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and or temperature fluctuation that does it i live in northern california so i don t know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem the silver aluminum one by contrast hasn t broken in now nearly a year of use and shows no hints of doing that it feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic no hint of plastic but it is very light and not heavy like the g ones are i made sure to order the silver aluminum one through amazon since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic and i only want to make sure i get the aluminum one the silver aluminum planet waves capo really is the best capo i ve ever had super easy to use very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you re going from playing one song to another you don t have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it which is a spectacular design it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos and it s out of the way of your hands doesn t interfere when you play any chord the screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn t hurt the fingers when turning it it s the least obtrusive and best capo ever i ll also add that i have an old carpal injury so i want the least strain and small hands so i want the least awkward and most light capo and this does that i absolutely love it and i m glad that the aluminum ones are durable i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player i play for fun and relaxation i have been playing for about years but only in the past years have i taken up the electric gutiar i have a very simple amp setup with a fender starcaster g as my practice backup amp and a fender mustang watt as my main amp i love the mustang but have always found the starcaster kinda weak well duh it is a simple practice amp i have very basic guitars a jay turser m series and an epi lp special ii i normally only use the mustang but latly have found myself really appreciating the simple clean sound that the starcaster can give but it is a one hit wonder i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome i order this pedal on a whim thinking that it might add a little depth the the starcaster and i might be more inclined to use this amp more boy did i hit a home run with that the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing it truely gives it a tube crunch but yet retains the nice clean sound when the levels are backed off flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster yea i know i can t imagine what this pedal would do on a real amp i also found that i m getting better response with my guitar tone knob too that was always an issue with this small amp the tone knob made very little difference not anymore i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people just for s and g s i plugged this into the mustang set on brittish s red and turned the levels way down amazingly it backed the crunch and distortion way off from this setting so now i can go clean without having to touch the amp all the reviews have stated how nicely this pedal works on the upper settings but it was great to find out that it can be used effectively to clean up a dirty channel i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps no for the nuts and bolts of the thing yup plastic well i m very gentle on my gear this sits on a table next to me and is activated with my hand so i don t expect issues but if i was a thrash metal rocker i would probably look elsewhere for durability don t drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate no issues there the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker i m using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement the box is heavy enough to stay in place but lite enough that i could easily toss it in a gig bag and not worry about it damaging a guitar cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime i left the unit plugged in overnight and there was no desernable heat in either the adaptor or the pedal after palying for an hour the pedal was still cool to the touch as was the adaptor my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself i got this for twenty bucks shipped amazon gave an estimate of days to arrive days yea it was coming from vegas to ny but days days later it finally arrived days more than weeks half a month i m pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny i don t know what the big delay was all about but i was horribly bummed about shipping times i ordered a few other items with this ac adaptor and ft insutment cable to use with this and they arrived days later all in all this is a great pedal outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget if you have a simple practice amp and want more out of it then grab one of these pedals and be prepared for amazment that so much sound can come from a little package if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder i have a less expensive solution for you if you own a usb wall charger like a cell phone charger you can use that to power your device through its usb port that s a lot cheaper than spending twenty something dollars on an additional wall wart this is my second after breaking the last one s neck the plastic socket around the ball socket joint couldn t take the stress in the gig bag i ll keep this one by the music stand i requested and received one of these as a christmas gift then bought another so i could keep the first one at a weekend place where i keep a guitar it works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings and keeps strings clean and rust free important here in humid florida and strings last longer than they did before i started using this even though i ve always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use i keep my slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc type bag because it s not airtight when you snap it together and i don t want it to dry out i hope when it does dry out that i can just add some juice to rejuvenate it i just don t know what kind of liquid to use i don t want to drop or so for a new one every time it dries out any ideas are welcome please add a comment to this review if you can help me out bottom line it extends the life of my strings and that s always good easy to use works as advertised use it for my various stringed instruments for the price i am very pleased i like the overall design of this mount although it would be nice to have a little bit more articulation the best thing is that i can leave my ipad in the lifeproof case for performances so i don t have to worry about water sweat or other various liquids and beverages hurting my main daime my ipad i use my ipad for almost everything these days and i certainly can t see going back to a lyric book after using the ipad and the set list maker app then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages ibooks etc it is a great tool for gigging musicians and this mount gets it up where you can see it best thing i ve bought for my ipad in a while
1099	after you have used this tool for the first time you say to yourself why did i suffer all those years by doing this manually i used to devote so much time to sitting there winding forever by hand with this winder you are done in an amazingly short time it also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts that on the bottom e i did a double take it is almost invisible thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one re stringing is now no longer the chore that i used to dread not at all i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best i doesn t take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time i bought this so i can keep some extra picks handy now if i can just decide where to adhere it to my guitar or my music stand or to the desk where i sit and play maybe i should just get one for each spot and each instrument yeah i think a few of these would be nice my favorite string from back in the s when i had my own guitar shop great strings and the best packaging i sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and i see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap but i don t know why maybe other people don t really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before it wasn t too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds but once i got it on it was stiff and felt odd it was very uncomfortable around my neck and i took it off my guitar in a matter of matters i would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap unless you re just going for something that is inexpensive does the job and isn t designed for comfort
1100	not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings they are the equivalent ofernie ball slinkys yellow they play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble non touring musician s opinion also it s nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer as a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the eb sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or dr sets that come two to a sleeve in summary if you re searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren t reading this review you re out experimenting for others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more bought these for my friend he asked for these exact strings his guitar always sounds awesome and i always ask his advice for musical products i even sound ok when i play his guitar so i say try em out these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now i ve had this amp for years and it still works and looks great took a while for me to learn all the things that the jam can do since i was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when i received it crank this baby up and it moves air i ve used all the in s and out s with no problems my rig consists of an ibanez as schecter devil custom line hd and an akg perception thru a line ux finally i only play at home so this gear doesn t get banged up from gigging i agree here as b russell said the only downside i can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged there are a lot of features on this amp but you need to learn how to use them the common features are easy to use but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp you will need to invest some time into it since i m not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual this amp fits me well i just picked up a pod hd and i love it of course a couple days later they announced the hd x but it doesn t look like they ve made any major changes anyway if you re thinking of getting one here are my thoughts in no particular order this thing is versatile you can use it in a number of different ways just as an effects board with customized effects with effects and amp sims as a midi controller and as a recording interface to name a few line gave you access to the guts everything is tweakable assignable and flexible they trust their users to read the freaking manual i m amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay no problemo for live performance this thing would be perfect it allows you to organize your presets in set lists and name everything whatever you want you can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves while not all the effects are my cup of tea in particular some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear there are enough options to make anyone happy for example i love the distortion i get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up the built in looper goes forward backward half speed before effects after effects fantastic it s built like a tank metal exterior everything feels solid and like it will last longer than i willif you ve got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance take a look at these and the new x version just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates not to mention the amps would cost you more money assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones truly a great piece of gear
1101	this pedal is outstanding for the price the feel is great and it doesn t move at all when you put it down on the floor the only thing i disliked was that it doesn t support half dampening like most of the higher end pedals around this price range i got this for christmas of and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio great product if you have a better mic you can plug that into the transmitter as it s a simple mini jack and that helps this sound wise quite a bit i will say range is not great it won t go feet like my expensive sennheiser kit but this will go about feet line of sight before cutting out note it s vhf not uhf so it is more prone to interference i find the transmitters to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well i also wish it was an xlr connection a lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so don t toss this around or it will break for general use in doors it s decent and for sure worth the price but if you re looking for something clear you should look to spend at least on a wireless lapel or handheld system needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer it is limited in what it can do but it does the job i m rapidly becoming a behringer fan the three points mentioned in another rating inputs should be out the back needs rubber feet and the led are spot on i d also like to see another set of outputs on it as well it could also use being a tad bigger they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together the led for the power on this thing is so bright it s obnoxious it almost blinds you other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise this could be a great mic and is similar to the shure sm but i ve found that most of these pyle pro audio products tend to have a much higher signal to noise ratio even plugged into my best preamps in studio spend more money get some quality mics these are only good for garage practice on a budget it s fairly tough but flexible no noise that i can hear and the connectors look solidly mounted i would definitely buy this brand again this was something i had to pick up simply due to the price i own a shure sm and compared to this the sound is very close not dead on but i d consider this over other mics for someone on a budget the top does not spin like the shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost i m sure but none the less it makes no difference sound wise overall a great buy
1102	well built and solid stand it keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar this stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars which should last a long time it can hold both acoustic and electric guitars highly recommend it in an attempt to see what s new in the pick industry i decided to dive in and give these a go they are way too flimsy if like me you use a heavier pick i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can t compete not only were they too flimsy but when i played with any aggression heavy rock based material the picks would fly out of my hands this was a huge disappointment we ve been only using it for two days and so far so good i cannot say anything about durability for now but i ll update this review if it breaks one of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old boss tu chromatic tuner forever for her violin and i finally bought this for her there are many clip on tuners but i liked the following about this tuner lcd mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you re off as opposed to just flat or sharp you can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway but a mic sometimes comes in handy can set different pitch than a not expensive was less than including shipping upon delivery i tried it on my guitars both acoustic and electric using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid and was impressed it is quick to track the note even for low e it s not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on no stress whatsoever indeed it s just as quick and smooth as my boss lcd is bright and clear and needle ish display works as expected it worked very well on violin too and i saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun and a note about the looks from the picture i expected it to be ugly but actually it was not that bad it s tiny and doesn t look like a fisher price product first update nov i ve tried it on an electric bass string and it worked equally well still stars second update oct it s still working happily for my daughter and i bought a second unit for myself fantastic product i can t say much about this product i tried it twice it seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings but i really didn t notice any great change the strings didn t sound betteer or brighter now it sits in my drawer and collects dust maybe i will try it again at some point but
1103	what great idea to put all three tools needed when changing strings into one tool the cutter even works well i recently sent two of my ovations back to the factory in connecticut for re work i just plain wore them out and they came back to me with these strings on them as soon as i took them out of their case and strummed them i immediately called the factory and said thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars and by the way these are the best sounding strings i ve ever played what exactly are they i might experiment with the exp s but by and large these exps are my new strings this pedal is outstanding for the price the feel is great and it doesn t move at all when you put it down on the floor the only thing i disliked was that it doesn t support half dampening like most of the higher end pedals around this price range i got this for christmas of and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio great product
1104	this stand is solid built and for the price you cant beat it the only minor problem i have it with it is that it begins to get a little wobbly once you start to bring it near it s max height it s great if you need to quickly drop your hats but not the other way around i bought this drop clutch because it was cheap and i was on a budget overall its build is solid the only problem i have with it is having the clutch lock back into place i like to hit things i use drums so nobody else gets hurt i need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not say local wildlife these have the sweetest tone for battery based abuse thanks vic also flammable
1105	this makes the second one of this straps that i have ordered and i love them they are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself i don t have not one bad thing to say great buy and will do it again if i ever need anouther strap i ve been using d addario xl strings since the s i love em the pack price is amazing it is just as described i am happy amazon always comes through without a hitch it was delivered as usual before stated time this beats using a adhoc string going around the headstock on my martin i ve heard horror stories about these devices coming loose and the guitars going head first into the floor strings might look tacky but they ll stay on there if tied properly just make sure the button portion is thru the hole in your strap securely then pulled it snugly so it won t pull out i use it every day at work i use it in my guitar classes easy to use and perfect size
1106	so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars used these for years on son s electric guitars no fuss mechanics do not seems to wear out still gripping no way at all to knock the guitar off the wall no neck damage to axes mounts well but try to find a stud certainly keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall no complaints if you re going to drill your wall is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers all star reviews on this baby and i agree and i add to that total stars this strap is really beautiful the native american pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar i made with the images of wolves burned into the top however the leather ends are very thick and stiff making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar i tried to put the snap on strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them i have a nice ralph marlin strap with soft pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort workable with one hand i d give this levy s strap stars if its ends were as flexible what a fantastic product i believe i have been wishing for this for years only one problem make sure that you want that pedal there because once it sticks you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot no longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel they actually stay attached to the pedal board i have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards this stuff works and is t u f f i you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need i just wish i could get paid for endorsing this product still holding strong building another board and using this stuff it s much better than regular velcro i don t have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit use this and that annoying issue goes away when i originally went out to place this order i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function as i looked over that device and some alternatives i finally ordered the tc helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect how could tc electronics put out the mic mechanic with a pitch correction function that didn t do anything well those reviewers were right the pitch correction function has no effect also i couldn t see any effect between engaging disengaging the tone button i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects but i m very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it
1107	it does what it says it does only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled times a week yet another awesome low cost guitar accessories from jim dunlop put the picks where you need them literally anywhere you need them stick it to the ceiling if you got to daddario s are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics they sustain well great tone tune well and last for a good while between changes lifesaver i bought this and a planet wave s o port which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well i use this at every show where i have to plug in this is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn t want to worry about feedback i bought these guitar picks for my son he really likes them a lot i would definitely buy them again
1108	this strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if i have it to max its to long that never happened to me and im lbs so if your tall buy it don t waste your time with the planet wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage the material used is fine the looks are fine the length is horrible this is too short for most adults that play guitar it felt like i was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders i attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what i could use to me this was a worthless purchase i just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again i ve had the same tuner for years i decided to upgrade i got this because it had alot of good reviews and it was fairly cheap it tunes better than any tuner i ve ever used worth every penny
1109	these are nice and sturdy picks they sound real clean i m having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings i still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics string changes usually take me to minutes each but i restrung all of my guitars in less than minutes one is a floating tremolo the spanner is smooth the cutter is strangely very clean cutting usually use electrician wire dykes and the pin puller is nothing fancy but does the trick quickly awesome little tool and very impressed with it a on every function would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands but other than that it s perfectly perfect very highly recommend i had always used the kyser clip on the top capos and still do but i liked the look on this dunlop clip on the bottom model it works great and looks better i bought these picks because i liked the color of the picks these picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are i play guitar everyday for around hours a day and i have yet to break one of these picks very nice quality and very cool color to them they are also priced very good much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar additionally they are very fast at shipping them to your door three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step i use this one a lot its light weight and sturdy it would be nice to have a counter weight for the long reaches but can work around that detail its well made stringed instruments are best hung vertically which this stand accomplishes beautifully constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment i started two years ago with a watt spider iii then along with other amps bought a spider jam i thought they were all great now they come out with spider iv and the difference in the sound is dramatic they are getting very very close to tube sound so much so that for the lousy compared to say for watts of tube this is a real steal loaded with features and hundreds of presets it has something for everyone the pitch shifter and available manual settings just add to the fun and it will work with either generation of fbv pedalboard says so right in the manual the only difference i see is with the generation ii pedal you get a usb port does it sound as creamy and smooth as my peavey delta blues or crate palomino tube units no there is still a little digital overlay around in there but most people who are looking for a great home based amp or maybe a church or small gig amp this is a winner and the price is just nuts forget the peavy vyper this is hands down much better and you don t have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the vyper the so called lower priced brother to the enormous line fbv shortboard mkii pedal while cut down still has a lot of the same features same quality build self powered when attached to my line modeling amp a real nice feature one less power supply to hook up foot switches are easy to use built in tuner works great the volume wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp sounds and have them instantly available when you play either at home or on stage is kind of good i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit tending to sound better for more time and last longer you just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so i m not sure if it was worth the purchase but is a good product recommended
1110	these strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive the tone is clear and bright i have used d addario for years i have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups some peope miss the quack electric guitar type sound from these other types i do not i also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified nor is any battery required i run it through a baggs para acoustic preamp or my fishman aura it really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly product was delivered safely and promptly just use a cloth or paper towel i ve had my eye on a g th capo for awhile but this became available in the vine program so i decided to try it the capo was easy to pop out of the package the design is simple and easy to understand and use it is very lightweight and works fine on my epiphone electric guitar the capo also has a handy built in pick holder this capo certainly meets my needs and i ve removed the g th from my wish list
1111	hey it gets the job done and that s all i can ask for i tried several cheapo pedals and this one was my favorite of them all while some had better casings metal instead of plastic at the end of the day i m looking for a good sound not a pretty pedal board the pedal seems solid enough it doesn t take up much space it sounds great and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come and if you are like the typical musician you are looking for something that s not going to break the bank first off let s get the dimensions out of the way for some reason finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible just try to find the dimensions of the dr on the epiphone web site length bout length lower bout thickness lower bout width so now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it the only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions is the length most bags are you can always opt for the epiphone hard case edread or world tour rwg d or gba the bag i got now that the hard part is out of the way finding a case on to the review as my title says the guitar reminds me of my samick st which is a very well made spruce top acoustic which is also made in indonesia i have played guitar for over years so i have a collection of over guitars and of them are acoustics but this is the first string and i bought it just to have it around for songs like hotel california etc and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar i would rarely use i am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under asking price it tuned up with no problems even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out you constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure the bridge plate on these strings must be huge i found that when tuning you should up stroke the small strings so that you don t hit the large one right next to it i have no fret buzz finger rash or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar and the strings sit low which i like the nut is a bit sharp on the edges but a file or sanding will take care of that the strings are not that bad and will do until the first change out i have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar from terrible to fantastic but the one i have is the later this pedal works great and doesn t slide at all the adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion i need not the best pedal out there by far but great for a beginner with a limited budget a year ago i wrote a lengthy comparison of theedirol r wave mp recorder blackand thezoom h handy recorder gb accessory kit pre accessory kit i wanted a high quality easy to use recorder so even though the h had all of the features of the edirol and sold for considerably less i kept the edirol because it was so much easier to use zoom has responded with the h a scaled down version of the h with all of the features of the r and all of the controls right where you need them the h even has additional features over the r but they don t get in the way for example there s a choice of a degree recording pattern a degree recording pattern and even a surround sound option samsontech has some nice video demonstrations on its website one big complaint i ve had with the edirol is the cost of its add on stand unlike the edirol the h comes with a simple stand in addition the h has a threaded hole so that it can be mounted on a standard digital camera tripod on a separate note it s much easier to replace batteries with the h than the edirol recently i got together with friends and recorded the same live acoustic music on both the edirol r and the zoom h i used adobe audition only to normalize both tracks that is equalize their loudness the first time we played them back i thought i detected a very slight preference for the edirol with the overall opinion of the group split between the two units the second time we played them back my preference was for the h with overall opinion continuing to be split we all agreed that the differences were so small as to be negligible if there were any at all i do prefer the edirol s control buttons to the h s membrane and i m not about to sell the edirol perhaps because i am more familiar with the edirol and don t want to give it up just yet also the edirol r is the darling of the moment however if i owned neither i couldn t justify the huge bump in price of the edirol over the h and would opt for the h when i went to a music party last weekend and knew i d need only one recorder i grabbed the h what else can be said that isn t implied in the title of this review not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who don t want to purchase the items separately my only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was years ago that and the fact they didn t play more songs but who can blame them their catalog is almost endless one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality
1112	i ve been using these cables for more than months and they are holding up pretty well for years i used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend when they finally gave out i got in the habit of using the no name cables that are always on display near the register at guitar center really more of an impulse buy than something i put any thought into after the third or fourth guitar center cable failed from light use i decided to try these cables not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better i am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as i move around and the cheaper ones eventually fail mid cable i don t mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable this cable is actually cheaper or so shipped and it s holding up pretty well these are actually very reasonably priced for cables there is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but i haven t needed it five stars for a nicely made foot guitar cable that costs shipped incidentally these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp s input do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose edit more than months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues the price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended there are probably better values from hosa monster or planet waves great all around mic used for vocals no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music if you re buying your first mic or switching from a cheapie and intend to use it for singing vocals this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation i ve never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic that came with some bundle years ago i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly you can stand feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in between the sm cn comes with the mic ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip the standard sm does not have a switch one less thing to break and i don t miss it but the sm s does have it for a few dollars extra i love it and there are a lot of bold type enhancements to my acoustic now the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting as with all digitech pedals i just seem to love their ease of operation the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible quite resistant and reliablegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thank you very much always good to have a stationary mic on the floor sometimes it is weet nestled in a drum set or for a singer that might not want to play any instrument but just wants to stand tall went together perfectly and i really wanted it shipping was fast and no problems thanks
1113	these are the only straplocks i use and i have them for all of my guitars they are the only ones i trust they are solid secure and they look great and the push button release makes them pretty convenient too without sacrificing security love em still using it today years later it s an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off i do question the leather part but since it doesn t say what kind of leather i suppose thats fine its still a good strap either way these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too
1114	hosa makes good stuff this is no exception i ve trusted them for years i can t think if a single hosa cable i ve owned that s failed at first i thought this would be a gimmick but it was cheap so i figured what the hell once i had it however i realized how invaluable it was when performing live i always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic once i got this little guy though i just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times volume remains constant white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear it also protected my mic in a fall once too can find anything better for this cheap this cable is very well constructed i use it in my dj business and i highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it this is my third purchase of this tuner all three work perfectly very easy to tune my basses one is for my younger son who just started playing the bass the other are for me one as a backup the reason why i gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post i may have to tape it down to keep it in place the other two tuners don t have this issue still it s the best around buy it this device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices armed with a set of headphones i can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my mp s mp player plugged in too worth the small price you pay as far as construction the battery door barely hangs on i m sure if i drop it even from a low height that door s flying off along with the battery these come in multiple thickness and are great because of the thickness and the grip that is on the pick makes it much easier to hold the pick as your hands get sweaty
1115	so far i m very happy with this microphone tone quality is fine and does everything i need it to do for backup vocals in my band although a longer cable would be nice it s great a cable and was included in the package great all around mic used for vocals no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music if you re buying your first mic or switching from a cheapie and intend to use it for singing vocals this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation i ve never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic that came with some bundle years ago i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly you can stand feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in between the sm cn comes with the mic ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip the standard sm does not have a switch one less thing to break and i don t miss it but the sm s does have it for a few dollars extra frankly i d never heard of a pop filter until my popping p s and b s came into consciousness at the same time that this device popped into my field of view on an amazon web page i ll bet that a couple of layers of women s nylon stockings would be just as effective but this contraption pretty much purges your elocution of the offensive phonemes they re called plosives i m still hearing the s phonemes sibilants along with some guttural artifacts back vowels prefaced by an h that ignite a momentary gargling effect but this filter doesn t purport to be able to do anything about those buggers as for the price after seeing the gooseneck the base the generous sized screws etc i m prepared to say that this one is fairly valued i doubt that the shure or blue pop filters at almost double the price offer anything more than brand name status the hardware and build quality are about as solid and heavy duty as you could wish for i know i ll never be able to blow it away unfortunately the clamp seems designed to fit on a mic stand rather than a computer screen which is almost a half inch too thick i can t do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer fox if you haven t started in the mic collecting business trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one i ve always wondered why i can t reproduce the sounds of our local npr outlet and i finally realize it s because they have the shure sm b and i don t it enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives face it those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use it s very directional and selective rejecting room ambience and background noise so it s perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications but for announcing broadcasting vocal performance and vocal recording i don t see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it this has the largest top of any of my stands and it is the one i use when traveling gigs the top doesn t fold like some of the more expensive stagg hercules stands so if you re using it for gigging that may be something to consider i have to lug an key weighted piano around so don t mind lugging this monster standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price it s flexible unlike some of their more expensive cable quiet solid and durable it s much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables for the money it s really hard to beat i won t waste money on the more expensive cables again the version i picked came with a grounding wire claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic producing snap crackles and pops if you believe that continue to do so and maybe you ll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device speaking more pragmatically i ve found some use for the item only when loose conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p a with an xlr jack and phantom power it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u the description on amazon fits the c u not the c so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p a amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a r t having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free i have owned this product for a while now it has some awesome features this little recorder is absolutely amazing for it s size takes some practice to appreciate all the features i recommended this recorder to a fellow musician friend he bought one also from amazon he loves it records all his gigs with it now instead of the old huge unit he was using told me it does a much better job than his old unit he even used his on a tripod to record a gravesite funeral service that his family can keep for memories of a loved one first i would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under second as a professional piano player i have never found a use for a traveling bench or stool think about it you ve got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand electric light and music perhaps even a storage case for the cables adapters extra fuses batteries tuners sometimes an extra keyboard or two or a couple of tone generators with midi cables or if you still pack a rhodes spare tines and a pair of wire cutters and you re going to add a bench to your weekly moving equipment caravan in of the locations that i ve worked i m able to locate a plain chair without arms usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players especially are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half remembered melodies to register the physical neurological effects until after the job i ve always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy not to mention prostate in fact if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded rising and lowering black steinway cushions try to replace it with a plain chair without arms especially if you re doing hour gigs sometimes two in the same day you ll notice the difference short and long term bottom line your back needs more pampering than your bottom which is why you need a seat with a back only concert artists like horowitz and rubenstein could get away with those cushy steinway stools minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement some of us aren t that lucky or gifted or smart this transfers my xlr mic to my usb laptop simply plug it in and find the right drivers my only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic it does seem like it can break easily thankfully i will never have to move it around much on my desk all in all it works and i am pleased i m surprised that the maker of amazon s popular at would go this low the mic imo is fully valued even at its single digit price it s dynamic rather than condenser but it still requires loads of power to get it up to workable levels phantom power which is a requirement for condenser mics would probably not add sufficient heft it s very lightweight and with its optional plug and on off switch is versatile enough the quality of the sound moreover isn t bad providing you can hear it be prepared to have plenty of watts on hand to coax any appreciable sensitivity from this non responsive creature i haven t tested it for recording purposes despite appearances this mic is no bargain first of all don t be oversold by the extraordinary value that some reviewers claim this fifty buck inputting device to be akai is considered a budget priced version of and a step down from sony which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself but it s the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with garageband band in the box finale sibelius audacity or a similar program the last thing i would do is lug a pound pc or sp kurzweil model plus ac power transformer upstairs to place on an over crowded desk even the pound yamaha np with its notes is awkward to use for this purpose make it nothing longer than a note keyboard but if you can get one at half the price of the e music note that may be the handiest most practical device for your needs sure there are alternatives you can click at a virtual keyboard that garageband makes available for a mouse but it s slow or you can download a virtual keyboard to your ipad or ipod for a couple of bucks but it s limited to no more than an octave and a touch screen which though superior to mouse clicking still isn t as satisfying or immediate as inputting by pressing down on actual physical keys this cheaply made even cheap but effective akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely especially for someone who s working in congested space it s regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard it s nothing of the sort nor should it be that s the reason i initially went with the np only to find that the bi purpose instrument i had in mind was impractical for either intended use take a look at the korg nano piano and if you re a pianist you ll immediately see the superiority of the akai but be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the akai or the e music or you ll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name performance this akai model looks and feels like a kindergartner s ten dollar toy but it s the best compromise i ve been able to turn up for my crowded work area i was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate if not be indistinguishable from the audio quality of the heavy duty shure microphones used at wgtd fm hd all the mics that i had previously tried at this price point and lower including blue s snow line sounded overly treblish with pronounced sibilance listen to the comparison contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration by contrast the yeti is rich and resonant and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter short of spending times more i m convinced this is the best option in my particular case at the same time as a musician without a home studio i seriously doubt i ll make much use of the mic for performance or recording as far as performance goes the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation upstaging the performer at least a vocalist with a normal sized head and for traveling purposes i ve found the sansom go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer even though blue s literature shows the yeti alongside a laptop blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of blue s lighter more compact microphones its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility but as other reviewers have mentioned the volume gain and pattern knobs are rather loose allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement the knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment there s the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control s circular movement but it s not at the o clock position so it s difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid point for quick and easy assessment of positioning in sum the yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably priced mics and it should prove a useful not to mention handsome addition to any home studio it s still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior it s main competitor on amazon the audio technica at is pint sized compared to the yeti and i ll confess i m still not sure whether i made the best choice the mics have been alternating in the and slots of best selling mics on amazon for months now i wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the at s relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise however slight to audio quality i experienced initial hesitancy on yeti s part to make an appearance in the input and output panels in system preferences of my imac then i read the instructions which discourage plugging the mic into a hub plugged directly into a usb port on my computer yeti immediately sprang into action my hunch is that a good powered port hub would be equally effective perhaps more than anything else it was the introduction and subsequent success of the zoom h personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi professional level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user friendly equipment at reasonable prices the price of the samson meteor usb mic a fairly recent entry has come down to the point of being fairly valued initially i was seeing it going for prices above the better sounding blue yeti mic it s an attractive some would say cute little mic with its quaint retro design and deceptively fold up portable size i say deceptive because due to the non adjustable mic stand it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop next to a computer and squarely in front of the narrator s mouth bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound it s good but nowhere close to studio quality it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking high fidelity audio to spend the extra for a blue yeti or an audio technica at usb as tempting as the lower price of the non usb version of the at is be sure to try it out with a pre amp supplying phantom power before going that route i ve known a couple of individuals who ordered the at condenser mic only to discover that it was useless with a computer even with the addition of a snake light cable if your primary considerations are convenience and portability the samson go mic sounds almost as good as the meteor and is unmatched in size convenience and portability it scored higher than the blue mikey and blue snowflake in my auditions i m tempted to say it s the perfect laptop mic clipping to the top cover more securely than the snowflake whereas the yeti is ideal for desktop use producing rich sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio s shure sm b mics being a musician i wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams with the support of this little recorder i have about of what i have played over the last year available to me sound quality there are many options to select from sample rate type mp wav and a number of other options i have mainly recorded wav at when i am done recording i normally will edit it in a daw and then convert to mp for storage i would say the audio is good not great but certainly right on for what i am doing considering the price power is about hours of continuous recording i can fit about hours on high quality on the gb card this is usually a little more than i require when jamming i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels many times at a jam you don t necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally several times it had to sit next to the drummer or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case and i was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated one instrument may be louder than another but then i tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance the only times it has failed has been i didn t have enough battery i didn t format the card and it ran out of room or i forgot to press the record button twice before recording the first arms the track the second begins the recording for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case i have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder just the external mics
1116	a good piece of kit except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs it s also squeakily noisy when string winding the cutter works perfectly the build quality could be better ideally the nut needs to be replaced the cut is a rush job and the neck needs to be reset there s a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn t completely cleaned out when it was put on but what do you expect for this price it is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you re willing to invest another or so it can be a great starter guitar for a young smaller player or a nice travel instrument this is a cool little amp sure it s really nothing to write home about but i like being able to take my strat and just sit somewhere and jam without having to have a generator to supply the power to conventional amps i wouldn t perform with it but great for personal use these strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips they are very light to play and make my practising easier whille iconcentrate on building callouses i like to attach all of my guitars by the neck headstock instead of using thetop button and have just used the typical shoestring in the past but no more once you get this baby on the strap it is not going anywhere i have a few of these installed on guitars and one bass i play a lot they obviously give a lot more support than a string and will not dig in tothe finish as a string might give it a try you just may like the way the guitar sits as you don t get the neckdrop that comes with just attaching to the body of the guitar
1117	these strings are very nice and sound great elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price these guitar strings are very nice and i love them i always buy this brand they work well and sound amazing schaller guitar strap locks work really really well however i had problems at first until i made some changes first off you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen the blue stuff will be more than enough second the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn loosen the screw over time kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar so when i install the new button i put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first never had one unscrew again if you do those things first you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident ever but you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock beatiful amazing strap very soft very confortable sits perfetcly on fender strap lock and looks like my g l custom fender select case what else so this strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily i plan on using strap locks so it won t matter to me but if you don t use strap locks your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole day my advice install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment then choose comfortable straps that won t scratch your guitar like this one i like these short planet waves cables for short runs where there won t be a lot of abuse going on they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range
1118	i bought this case for my rogue a style electric mandolin the inside is nicely lined the hardware is solid it came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap i recommend this to anyone with an a style mandolin jafmusicmix i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin i bought a rogue mandolin from a friend who bought from amazon but did not have time to even play it for only still brand new never played i have owned and played many other mandolins about a dozen this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills the mandolin is not playable in its brand new state not in tune action too high lower action will result in string buzzes and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup i went thru all the necessary steps almost like a luthier would do and it came out sweet it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation one can find info about mandolin setup on the web it s quite tedious work this will be my beater mandolin at nothing can beat it it stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re tune so this is more than adequate for daily practice often times it even stay in tune the next days i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one the finish on this model has some blemish some small black spots on top the sunburst color but only if you look really close i would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred at less than no problem at all of course this mandolin is no match for more expensive models brands such as kentucky but i gave it a stars based on its high performance cost ratio if you don t know how to setup mandolin then be prepared to pay to for a professional setup which is a must otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge that s unfair all brand new mandolins require setup at this expense unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it if you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this d addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars and now my two mandolins consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand i am just learning how to play the mandolin one of the problems i was having was supporting the mandolin and fretting the notes since i got this strap adjusted i no longer have to hold the neck so i can concentrate on the notes i like the fact that you can unclip the strap at either end without touching the adjustments so i can put it into my case without having the strap laying across the neck yet pick it up and with one click it is ready to play easy accurate and best of all it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing i ve tried other brands and they don t swivel correctly and it s red very cool
1119	this polish was recommended in one of dan erlewine s books and it works great it really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop the effect isn t as noticeable on darker finishes though it really helps on the back of the neck too makes it slippery and fast highly recommended i bought my first one from amazon over a month ago and simply fell in love with it it cleans polishes wood metal although for strings i use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc with wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids i even recently bought a nd just because and yes the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use i knew it was time when it wasn t wiping off the smudges as quickly it came out with a slightly nappy texture to be expected really but still works as well as ever there is a vast amount of different polish cloth brands out there but you won t go wrong with this one dunlop pick holder this is very handled always forget were my pick got off too now i know my picks is in the holder they do what they are meant to do no complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them
1120	i played with light acoustic strings for a long time i tried these and they make for much easier action do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings i ll probably stick with extra light for awhile they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers i m another reviewer who has upon personal inspection discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar i returned it i ve first act brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed i ve two of these stands on one of them the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand you ll see that the base of the tubing is welded there mine lost its weld so the tubing is not secure to the grey base they separate i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor update glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand beware and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in wait for it china that may explain why it failed but glen ingles could have offered to replace it i guess he doesn t want me to buy any more of his products or refer others to his products well that s his policy that s okay he s got competition and i ll be purchasing from them instead hohner marine band hohner special and lee oskar major diatonic harps fit well in this case hohner s big river harp does not fit properly in the case it is longer than the others and doesn t snug in i ll either return the case or order two lee oskars to replace my two big river models or i can just deal with the fact that they don t fit quite properly but probably good enough decisions decisions haven t played the toy harps yet first things first i bought the case for the case not for the included harps so based on the reviews from amazon and a friend who swears by these pickups i decided to put one into my taylor i am extremely pleased this was my brother s guitar and he had a mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop it sounded terrible i tried messing with placement to get it to sound better but it just didn t sound good had tons of feedback and just didn t have a good feel i installed this pickup myself i have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars and this one was pretty painless i didn t have to drill out the endpin hole so it only took me about minutes to install this bad boy when i tested it out i was blown away it sounded beautiful just like my taylor only louder the true test was an actual live performance i brought my baggs para acoustic d i and i was glad i did i was able to adjust the eq just a tad cut some of the mid range a bit and it sounded even better i could not believe it it literally gave me chills if you re on the fence about this pickup go for it the reviews don t lie this sounds fantastic especially if you can eq it a bit i did plug in without the padi just to test it and it still sounded good if i forgot my padi i would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system it might be labeled as passive but it s got the volume of an active system for sure it s a great buy in my opinion i use this all the time for acoustic guitar banjo mandolin as well as an autoharp and my daughter s fiddle i ll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused for my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open g even if it s too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well i ve used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job nobody really gets excited about tuners but i ve been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that i know of when i started out if you wanted to tune and didn t have a input good luck tuner works great both by vibration and mic only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak mine broke off not even a year old
1121	i ve tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last years and i ve settled on d addarios for all my guitars their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency the price is right they re color coded to make string changing easier and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more the s are my choice for rock and blues d addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as i can remember this guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars as an amateur musician i m always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such i thought this gadget would do the trick but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn t meet my expectations i am self taught and this pup is essential for tune writing finding quickie relative minors and such if you want to understand any theory start here after learning basic chords this is how basic chords relate to each other yeah baby if you re boss you need the info austin powers nice grip the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost constantly are lossing guitar picks the device itself is difficult to read in bright light my first one arrived not working at all the second one arrived with a low battery what after three days the battery goes out i would have returned it but lost it because it doesn t adhere to the headstock very well you ve been warned works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help comparing it to my old boss tu dedicated guitar tuner this works just as good
1122	if you re worried that the mm is too big for your guitar you re probably right if you don t use a pick for your bass then you don t want this either but if you want to pick your bass this is the plectrum for you so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars most better quality leather guitar straps are typically or more so in retrospect the low cost of this planet waves black leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag i bought it anyway hoping that it would be a decent product but unfortunately upon receiving it i was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the item while the strap appears to be leather and isn t a piece of junk it doesn t appear to be of very high quality the leather is thin and soft and i would not be at all surprised if the edges soon begin to curl and the strap begins to wrinkle i don t expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts to hold up well long term if you use this strap you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system i have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges while the leather has developed some cracks it is still holding up fine and there is no chance that the strap will tear i could be wrong but looking at the planet waves strap i have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long if you are a casual player this strap is probably fine although strap locks are recommended the leather may start to curl up and deform but the strap certainly isn t going to fail immediately while serviceable more serious players or those with an aggressive style of playing might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap i decided to keep this strap but it is installed on a secondary guitar that i don t play that much i normally use dunlop s mm nylon picks but decided to give the mm max grips a try when the price dropped to for a dozen the top half of the max grips have a special surface with tiny ridges that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip the feeling is a little strange at first but you should get used to it quickly i like the feel and playability of the mm max grip s but they are little more flexible than i prefer so if i were to get another set i would get a thicker type either mmor mm it s a pretty cool little gizmo the clip on feature is really helpful too makes me wonder what i did before i had one
1123	this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years it really does have a ton of range although it only does one effect at a time so you d have to reach down and change the knobs mid show in order to get the other variations my most commonly used setting was with the overdrive distortion mix knob at about o clock which produces a very professional sounding grunge type effect if you want any of those s sounds excluding the heavier metal sounds this pedal will definitely get you there oh its a crybaby i have a crybaby wah you suck because you don t own a crybaby i m tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn t even tell you how many strings their instrument has this wah pedal just doesn t cut it maybe at one time but not today it hasn t been up to par in a long time as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal my mom bought me this one i thought it was awesome until i learned better it took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when i finally did i thought i broke it the eq on this pedal isn t good there is no smooth transition from heel to toe there is a big drop in the freq that kills the effect you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop you have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board i can t say its just a complete piece of junk it does give you a wah effect it is a classic pedal but there is better out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing i even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue i still had to slam on it to turn it on off and it still sounded like a cheap wah my suggestion the mark tremonti wah is great kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use it may cost more but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway so just go with the tremonti power wah to begin with what i use for wah is the digitech rp processor you may say that this is a cheap processor and it is but i ve been using it for years and i haven t seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters why i suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on i have mine set fairly light and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily you even have presets crybaby being one of them you can get an entire processor full of effects and an awesome wah for a little bit more if you want a cheap child s gimic type toy this is for you want to get serious about a wah spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere i feel strange giving this classic only stars but it s just not for me it s large and takes up space on my pedal board i prefer the little big muff usually picks are picks but these are a blast i play by holding the horns between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes i had to order extra bags of these because people keep begging for one consider the distortion sound of cream the doors and zz top that buzzy psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does unfortunately that s about all it does however if you want to have the perfect break on through guitar intro sound this is absolutely the pedal for you quality wise it s awesome and if i needed that sound i would definitely own one again i got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions and honestly i haven t missed it because i m not in a doors cover band or anything
1124	i ve been using the same straploks on all my guitars for the past years i have not had one fail on me ever just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it s on right i ve struggled with the c clip in the past but what are you going to do it s a one time thing when you first install so it s no biggie i purchased several of thes fender mini stands because i don t have a lot of sapce for my guitars and i fold these up and stick them in my closet when need i don t need them for approx ten bucks you can t go wrong they work as well as bulkier more expensive stands erm it does what it say it would do the nice thing about the super is its size in turn and its ability to hold more water here s what strap locks are supposed to do securely attach your strap to your guitar these do that much better than schallers and the fender rip offs of schaller i used the schallers many years ago they look great but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc but at one gig with my super heavy american deluxe string jazz bass the nut worked its way off the strap and i dropped it it was with a heavy leather strap and i did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and i m sure i kept it maintained absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable never again unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig forget about schallers they re a good company and they make great tuners i don t fault the materials it s simply that threaded things can work their way loose a fatal design flaw for this type of device come on its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident if you re having trouble getting the lockrings on i have a youtube video posted to my channel nickweissmusic just search for dunlop strap lock installation it s kind of tough at first but with experience it s very easy the package instructions are correct but not very helpful i have these on more than instruments and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade the package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock but i have never done so in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this i ve never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks if i did i d probably just replace it i do give the locks a little tug when i put them on to make sure they re engaged other than that you can forget about them which is the way it should be the only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the schallers do to which i say who cares well i guess a lot of people care about that since i see it in a lot of reviews if using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar so be it i have seen ernie ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile i think they use lock rings too maybe try those but i m sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops they say months i ve never come close to even a month usually weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that weeks if it sounds too good to be true it usually is i don t recommend these can t believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old pin connector i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector this is now a boat anchor to buy a meter cable from them they charge for the cable to ship it and then tax the extortion here is almost monster cable like these folks should be embarassed the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn t cut it i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display i m quite disappointed and it sits here with no use it is cheap though still to me it was money out the window
1125	this amp plug is great for the price its ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price i play guitar and keyboard and sometimes i need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards i would not do that without this straplok i love d adarrio strings great tone and it last long feels great on your fingers d adarrio strings rule see ya i ve come to the point where anytime i buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves they are good quality decently priced and i don t have to worry about them shorting out on me definite buy normal pickguard screws nothing special here you do get a nice amount for the money though so this is still a good if not great deal good to buy for stocking up with just don t expect anything special because of the fender name this was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings he found just what he needed and at a great price i really like the idea of a pick pocket in the strap in fact i like it so well that when i replace the strap on my other guitar i ll make sure it also has the same type of strap i ordered two of these stands and they work very well definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things this is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looper no complaints with this works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro sounds good amazing for the price good buy can d go wrong i honestly don t know alot about guitar picks but they seem to get the job done no problems here i have been using the same one since i got them and have not broke it yet lol this is a genuine fender switchcraft brand input jack it is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies but that s an easy adaption if using a copy strat it works perfectly great price from the seller as well if you want a sturdy jack this is as good as it gets they sound pretty good they tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments arrived as expected and as described capo is well made and is very well priced i am very happy with the purchase i payed the for this just because the tuner i have was so slow to respond i needed something new the response time on this is like half a second and it s super simple to use keep in mind that the snark website sells this tuner for so the cost here is definitely worth it this is a solid stand with good adjustability and a thick decent quality foam to cushion your guitar bass its only fault is its price amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good simply search for guitar stands on here and see for yourself i bought this on a whim to use as a low cost tuner for my hola uke and find myself using it on my six string guitar and four string bass as well it tunes quickly and easily with different colors used for when your too high or too low in pitch and uses green as the color when you nail it very nice and easy to use it s also very compact easily storing in even the tightest of gig bags even your pants pocket will do for traveling i highly recommend this if your on a tight budget and can only get one tuner for multiple instruments it s a bargain and it works great you can t honestly ask for more
1126	works very well keeps the popping to a bare minimum easy to install cleans in a flash lightweight and works this was an impulse buy after playing the guitar for many years i thought a ukulele would be a fun addition and i was right this one proved that you don t have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument it has a great sound appears to be good quality and well made all for a very reasonable price at first it didn t seem to stay in tune for more than a day i decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months if your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot this is a nice instrument it s easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly these picks are bigger than i expected easy to hold and very soft they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks i bought the special pro pack keys g a c love them was using cheep pidmont blues harps toys i had to have more like an addiction i bought a d then this bb then e won t be long i ll get a f this harp bb has a beautiful tone always loved the sound of the bb made in germany quality musical instrument not a toy if you own special s then you already know how good they are if you don t try one you might end up with like me or more in no time worth every cent if they are good enough for john popper bob dylan they re good enough for me a pleasure to play joe
1127	there s a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these and if it doesn t it should this is a great all purpose dynamic mic i use it for instruments vocals even field recording sometimes the sm has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals but that doesn t mean that the can t handle a voice they re pretty much the same mic as far as i m concerned and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner i think you ll find the same thing and if you re operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably then you probably already know what you re looking for i ll be getting a to add to my personal cabinet soon but if you re like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics you can t go wrong here the cry baby has proven itself since the s it is a very well made pedal that is a must have if you play any classic rock it takes a bit of practice to master but when you have mastered it you can take your music to a different level seriously this is a great pedal i can t improve upon what others have said but i will mention a few points i use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone or to add more crunch to my fender frontman when inserted in the effects loop it s run before time based effects delay phaser etc for me i sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies if it gets noisy or self oscillates after a while change the battery to a fresh one better yet use an ac adapter i found out about the last issue after reading a few harmony central reviews otherwise it s been on my setup for about seven years i take care of my stuff as lc condenser it s definitely a light weight but for lesse than a bucks it sounds pretty good used on acoustic guitar with less than satisfatory results but got a great sound out of a violin and a fairly decent voice sound looking forward to more tests this does some fairly cool things to the sound but there is a lot more out there this would be great for a new person experimenting with effects
1128	i have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my mogami gold cables if you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound this might not be the cable for you however for the price and purpose this a five star cable the plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection but also feel sturdy and secure the gold plating ensures a solid connection what i like most about this cable is that it s guaranteed for life and i can bring it to a planet waves authorized dealer for a replacement or so their packaging claims i have not had to replace mine my aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it it s been in heavy use hours per day ever since we got it many months ago and i don t think we ve even had to replace the batteries yet it s got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust we tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn t loud enough and my kids though very adept at touch screens found them tricky to adjust this one is great i love this little guy clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you it will still accurately tune the guitar very easy and simple to use i paid for it and it is times better than the one i have i bought this amp for practicing my bass at home i really liked the sound it was crisp and clear just like i expected from an ampeg it looked great and felt solid then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case the rattle just got worse louder as i played it was very annoying i didn t feel comfortable opening up a new amp and trying to trouble shoot it myself i had visions of voiding the warranty and being stuck with an amp i couldn t play i was sad returning the ampeg great sound for the price but i was soured on ampeg perhaps unfairly from a sample of i replaced it with a fender bronco which has an ampeg emulation setting so my bass world is back in balance admittedly since the fender bronco was more than twice as expensive as the ampeg i have thought that i could have just taken the money i spent on the fender bronco and bought a more expensive ampeg on the guess that a more expensive ampeg would have a better design or materials or quality control but a guess is just a guess and i didn t want to test that guess by throwing more money at ampeg so the fender bronco got my money my rating of stars is an average of stars for quality of sound and a star for quality of production beware this tuner works by guitar vibration if your playing loud with other people you ll have to ask them to stop playing so you can tune not recommended for band environments probably ok for solo gigs or home practice otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars
1129	although i have a pedal board with effect pedals there are additional effects on my amplifier i can easily now turn and press the desired effect amp button is sturdy and good for price i ve had this for about years and i agree with every one here that this is a fantastic amp at a good price point it s a wonderful sounding amp and gives you good chimey cleans and lush distorted breakup it only gets better as the speaker breaks in so make sure you put lots of hours on it initially and you will be rewarded if it was between this an a blues jr which are similarly powered and priced i d opt for this in a second i think the ac c is actually a better blues amp opinions vary of course i only have a couple is wishes as they re not really gripes one is the stock reverb it s really overboard in a way that i didn t find musical i ordered a new tank and now it s great i hope vox changed this out because i found anything over on the stock tank way too much second would be an fx loop not a deal breaker as the amp takes pedals well but it would a good feature as wold be channel switching built in third and last i wish it came with a footswitch to turn the trem and verb on off and switch between the top boost and normal channels i know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice probably one of the reasons it s so affordable and speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an a b y switch for this it allows you to switch between the top boost normal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at the same time and let me tell you there are some really sweet tones when you run both channels at once i ve gone through a fair amount of gear in my time but don t see getting rid of this it s such a fun little amp that it s nice to have around even if it were not my main go to amp it s certainly loud enough for small venues and jamming with a controlled drummer but it s not going to shake the paint off the walls like an ac highly recommended i m not sure what i was expecting this definitely is a fuzz but the one i got doesn t seem to have much in the way of subtlety it s either nothing a lot a lot more or way too much it s not bad and it s probably just my personal preferences but this just isn t my cup of tea
1130	works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too i got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin sucked big time so we got this to use instead works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it i know everybody knows this already but i ve never played with a bow before most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers having bought sizes of ukulele only to discover the baritone uku is much like a classical guitars lower strings i was curious for bucks to see what it is like to play the mandolin if you are interested in this style of play search you tube videos and watch people i have not found anyone cutting hotel california out on these things i also didnt feel like i wanted to learn yet another chord set tried playing the electric guitar even going and getting rocksmith software to learn which is prety cool anyhow i changed the strings on the baritone to be a ukulele so this mandolin has a very thin neck maybe width i have watched videos of other people playing and their necks look wider this is hard to fat finger yea i have fat fingers my initial problem is this thing doesnt come delivered anywhere close to ready to go the saddle moves is not hard mounted and has height adjusters so once i figured that out and also put some in oil on the nut so when tuning the strings dont drag whether this is right or wrong i dont know i did it regardless i measured from the nut to the th fret then the th fret to the saddle and moved the saddle so both measurements were really close if you are having tuning trouble withe yours i bet this is the problem with your tuner set your strings tight that was another problem this thing should twang high pitched like the dude in the geico commericals again on you tube someone posted videos of tuning i also read buy a very stiff pick not for me i guess i am not gentle and smashed the strings couldnt keep the pick in my fingers so i use a light one the grounds for using the stiff was the pick will not bend and create delay i guess between the two strings same note the light weight one works well for me when i do pick this thing up it is not hard to tune i use my ukulele snarks and pick one string at a time it is a cute guitar regardless and i saw one for sale used at guitar center for bucks same one if you are someone who can play guitar this might be fun i suck at it i pretty much suck at ukulele playing too but manage to play rock tunes that actually sound like something i might some day figure out how to tune it like a ukulele but you can play songs with three to four chords good luck as far as banjo strings go these are a good bang for the buck or were when i got them d addario makes a pretty consistant product i ve used them on everything over the years although i prefer certain brands for other things strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as well if you buy a cheap instrument here do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they ll be strung with trash if it s a lower end instrument from china even if you re starting out you should tell the difference right away i use this all the time for acoustic guitar banjo mandolin as well as an autoharp and my daughter s fiddle i ll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard this works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused for my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open g even if it s too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well i ve used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job nobody really gets excited about tuners but i ve been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that i know of when i started out if you wanted to tune and didn t have a input good luck
1131	sturdy cord and plugs inexpensive good value i don t require professional level equipment so this cord serves my purposes well satisfied with purchase this was a great investment for my home studio i ve been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my condenser microphone i should of bought this a long time ago for me being a solo string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me and you get the extra plugs ins supplied by focusrite too with this interface i cannot say i am wild about the included software which is ableton live lite i really disliked the screen views of ableton and thought they were hard to view so i did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested mixcraft wow i like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork mixcraft is so user friendly and you don t have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it you can be laying down and recording tracks in no time and shouldn t recording be fun and not frustrating besides the focusrite interface recognized mixcraft as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins so all and all it turned out great and i am a happy camper this in my opinion is one of the best entry level recording audio interface units around it also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface engineered in england and on the downside made in china isn t everything these days
1132	it s ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected i would recommend going a little higher price it also arrived cracked it doesnt completely mute my violin but i suppose nothing really can it does take the loud peircing noise out though i prefer shar s overture premieres which are the same price these ones are a little too bright in sound and not deep or resonant enough also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying a set this does work as described it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable its quite hard on your collarbone i have added foam to it and now it works well but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place i bought this to replace the inexpensive musedo t tuner that came bundled with my kala ka s ukulele the snark sn is much more accurate but its lcd display is not very bright and has a narrow field of view yes i did try a fresh battery but it made no difference i wish it were brighter and easier to see still it s a very good tuner overall
1133	i opened the package for the first time and didn t think much of it but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job obviously cardboard isn t going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths the capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard what i like most is that the padded arm is thin and keeps out of the way of your playing highly recommended they are comfortable to use the planet wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick and i like heavy picks so the heavy option fits my preference i ve got a gig tomorrow night so we ll see how they work then i wasn t expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner i have to say it is one good funny looking clip on tuner many useful functions i especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything like the capo and metronome feature i just really like this little guy good job snark
1134	i own the old ibanez ts that i modified to the original keeley specs side by side there is a difference but i only use it for my rehearsal rig this is the first pedal i ve had to actually read the manual in order to figure out how to install the battery the instructions tell you to use a ball point pen to press in the hinge pins in order to remove the foot switch cover i laugh when ever i hear about the holy grail ic chip when i modified my ts i found that chip at mouser for cents a piece it was a net order and i felt weird ordering so i ordered they send a pound catalogue every month because of that purchase the behringer to is a cheap alternative to the original if you re on a budget and will do in a pinch the civilians won t notice the difference they are a wonderful product the lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar with these you can t go wrong
1135	i tried this model a few years ago and i never had a problem with them once i got it installed but i went back to the schallers i had on my other instruments i thought and this has been mentioned by others that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument which i thought looked goofy i also didn t particularly care for the push button release and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge these have a c clamp not a nut so there s no allowance for differing thickness i also felt safer with the schallers which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn t depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together as i said i had no real problems with them so if they look like they d work for you great as with all replacement strap locks buttons you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers dropped out of airplane or what have you i use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars except for the smaller takamine new yorker and a l ami i use the d addario custom lights i have grown a fondness for the phosphor bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking also the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys i ve tried such as martins and elixirs these strings are quite durable and long lasting in the years i ve been playing i ve never had these strings break on me i ve broken martin and elixir strings in the past the color coded end balls help with the restringing i typically get the three pack so i can restring a trio set of my herd at a time i really can t complain about anything the individual gauges are w w w whighly recommended this strap is very thick and heavy which give you a good secure feeling the heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through but your know that they are not going to slip back out the picture does not do it justice i paired it with my black epi lp and it looks phenomenal i am very impressed with how nice this strap is it s well make and cheap compare with other product on amazon nowadays market i i do replace it for guitar cable work fine i m happy with this unit recommend to someone need replace cable jct i bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers thus far i am very pleased some of my guitar effects require at least milliamps which this adapter handles with no problems i have heard no hum or noise from the adapter either it does its job reliably and well i would definitely recommend it to a friend i got this on sale from gc for shipped plus tax arrrgh first and foremost this amp is amazing all the hype and positive reviews you read are all true my playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs lol and this amp does it all the tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just can t be described they have to be heard the modulations and del reverbs are well done also there are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the fuse software or taken out completely all the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good even with my substandard playing ability both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp the tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use headphones work well also about my only real complaints are so minor no place to store the power cord or usb cord included printed documentation is pretty lame but the included dvd is more through the fuse software has to be downloaded and as i have limited online speed this took over an hour the headphone jack is a mm and most good headphones are still using the not a big deal but the mm to adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy the amp gives an audiable pop when powered down no corner protectors on this all in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you s of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under clams this is an extremely versatile pedal i was considering getting a reverb or delay pedal but i decided to go with this instead since it s infinitely more flexible there are tons of effects some i might not use but there are plenty i will use new firmware was just released and it adds a few extra effects you download the firmware and install via the usb port i use it with a vht special i have a fulltone ocd after the zoom it works nicely with the tube amp whether or not i turn the ocd on the effects sound excellent to me i m now a zoom fan if you re lusting after a bunch of effects pedals but only have the cash for one this is a really good option at a minimum you ll hopefully figure out the you won t really use without having to shell out the cash for them
1136	these are good strings for a good price i have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time i use these on my fender strat and they sound great if you appreciate the talent of david gilmour and respect his taste and choices in music than i would recommend these strings i used to use elixir strings and as great as elixir sound they do not last long these do i have played guitar for over years and i am very happy with these strings i use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano i have a pro model with xlr outs to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces works every time balanced signal is so much better no more issues with ground loops or other problems just clear as a bell they were cheap and the build quality is fine for the money you can not beat this the quality is great for the money i mainly use this at home for my project studio but have used it in a professional studios a few times the stands my studio uses are a lot more expensive then this but work just the same the only difference is obvious that this stand my not last for ever with everyday use in a professional enviorment i see this stand lasting me for at least five or six years at home i gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day and visually it s hard to read because the lettering is so small also there are many function for one knob to have a little confusion for me the sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice but not something that is best for my needs i am looking into a boss me instead
1137	sure there are fancier tremolo pedals out there but i ve always been a fan of the boss tr it s got a more mellow and vintage fender tremolo output and suits my playing to a t pair this beauty up with an electro harmonix cathedral reverb pedal and get lost for days definitely worth the reasonable cost i thought i would throw my two cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier after making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge i started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas especially the body where it is needed the most even though i was getting acceptable humidification in the case i was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so i went ahead and splurged the bucks on these i actually bought three of them i crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and a c in the summer keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet the humidity drops quite low but the sponges remain moist for several days before i can no longer fight the urge to re wet them lol two great tips in one use a regular more dense sponge thicker like the ones at the dollar store cut them to size and stuff them in throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don t worry about distilled water unless you want to i can t argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced don t worry about the thing hanging in between your strings it will not damage anything unless you get the sponge too saturated and it leaks i will either squeeze the excess water out or shake the container with the sponge inside until i am satisfied that it won t drip the humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole if you are rough careless thoughtless or stupid you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out but i would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen this would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause the top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover the sponge inside is quite small and there isn t too much room for a much larger sponge the device is simple and fairly solid treat it gently and it will last forever you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher if you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills i m sure it would be a decade before anything built up to require extensive cleaning or replacement keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re wetting the sponge try to keep the sponge moist when it s dry i strongly suggest getting an oasis case humidifier or similar mini sized about x costing around bucks this will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp too dry and it will shrink and crack split the soundboard top also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive if you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and or dry you would be negligent if not careless to spend the pittance to make sure your baby ain t thirsty or worse dead broken hope this helps does the job i ve had this for about months and it hasn t let me down yet except for that time i couldnt find it the winder the cutter and the pin pull all work well enough noted i ve only used it to cut elixir nanoweb strings and nylon strings and they more on the soft side compared to regular steel strings have to try them more and with other amps by now they work really good and no interference where detected at least by my ears what i like is that they last a lot these are the second planet waves cables that i own and the first ones are still in great conditions i have a watt combo amp i was looking for a smoother sound and got it in this tube it lacks the brutal attack of the sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the nos rca gray plate i tried for over a year but i m really liking this sound for what it is i think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical with nice natural compression and that s what i m getting out of this jj i ordered these for a gibson songwriter deluxe ec custom vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro touch longer than the stock pins from gibson the pins measure mm or inches in length i was going to return them but figured i would try them out in my gibson blues king l parlor sized guitar it was about the same result a little too thin smaller heads and slightly longer but i went ahead and tried them glad i did i didn t think that after using the tusq bridge that came stock from gibson it would make any detectable difference but i was wrong i can tell a slight difference i did not remove the strings just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it which were fresh from yesterday a small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable they also provide a graph in the packaging info but i think that it was a test using both the tusq pins and replacement saddle if you haven t changed your saddle do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one i must admit i did order these with about of dressing up the guitar in mind and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected i got both white with paua dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy i was seeking although there is no care taken as to match the dots for consistency they will vary in appearance the tusq pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar the heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher and i do wish that the tusq pins were the same size i will see how well they do on the blues king and most likely will order new pins for the songwriter deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two i don t expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion if in doubt consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the tone you have in mind be it darker brighter softer louder etc strings make a big difference and i find using d addario phosphor bronze strings very bright ringy last long are affordable and seem noticeably louder than ghs or ernie ball steel strings only does not apply to nylon or gut strings once again if you have a plastic saddle and or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference then again they might make all the difference in the world you just have to try them and see they are inexpensive and pretty well worth the risk man when i saw these things a light came on in my head it was an uh duh moment no noise plenty of length and nicely spaced with right angle plugs for all your standard v dc pedals any complaints about noise with these cables it just a symptom of something wrong within their setup i had an old wall wart laying around and put it to good use check the total amount of amperage draw usually milliamps to make sure your wall wart can handle it and daisy chain away without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my pedal guitar effect lineup no noticeable hiss hum or buzzing clean quiet good buy for the price excelent product great quality and useful in many different ways i specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing since it can record up to seconds and it will not end unless you stop it this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos i also have it connected in a fxs loop with the mustang fender iv and it works just perfect in stereo mode the reverse mode rocks allows you to do great fading delay violing efect this is simply the best pedal i got since it s so versatile i do play metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ love it fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands if you have the smaller screw headed ends on your microphone stand you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing maybe a dollar if they don t just give it to you using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out getting in the way plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera the set screw presses against a ball socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile i am very careful not to over tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing but at this price i guess you can t expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism eh there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a degree preset angle the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera be careful the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras i found a little plastic threaded washer like ring that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc to hold it in place when in storage or transport you could also leave it attached to your camera either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost overall the little thing is quite solid heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small basic solid and inexpensive it holds well when bumped or moved mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose i would not put a larger sized mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter most modern devices will do just fine again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well don t put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years mine has i m happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas hope this helps if you are ordering these to replace one or two of your gibson speed knobs you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to gibson s in all fairness these could possibly be better than gibson s stock seem to be made with a more solid underside but the numbers are a little bit smaller this is the only reason i gave them four stars fit perfectly on cts potentiometers and if you replace all four of them nobody except you will know lol all four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects as opposed to other reviews if you get these and they aren t perfect send them back until you get a perfect set it s free hope this helps not much else to say
1138	i ve used d addario s on so many different guitar s the only opinion i can honestly give ya is that they are the best in the studio or on stage they stay in tune and work very well with any pickup you are using i put these on my wife s bass cause she is still learning and with a fender squire it sounds almost as good as a precision fender bass they stay true to the note so she will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time i give the product a star for doing what it is supposed to do i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period generously i ll give it stars something like this really should last at least a year or more cheap parts manufacturing cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature i was a bit disappointed in this gadget it just doesn t have the quality sound that i expected from the material written about it i ve had much better luck with a simple interface between my guitar and iphone or ipad that arrangement isn t as compact as this vox product but the sound is much more pleasing this little snark is easy to carry around and works great i have used several different styles and brands this is a must have for musicians
1139	i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot i believe its the older metal version of this not the lite however this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner on a martin jumbo acoustic it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too i m not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one it doesn t seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw i wouldn t recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use if you are looking for the screw down style i would look for the older version of this and avoid the lite this little guitarlele is great i have tuned to the standard e tuning of a guitar and it manages very well it gives a gently subdued tone that is perfect for playing any time even accompanying music on the tv whilst the family are watching i have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than i had with my twelve string in the last six months added info now that the tuning has settled down it is keeping tune very well with no need to retune during playing the strings it came with are not the best though they are wearing through all ready extremely easy to use tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly have used it several times and first battery still has juice this tuner works great i am not able to vouch for accuracy who but the best tone person can as a musician you wonder how accessories like a capo which have been around for centuries can be improved sure enough the planet waves capo has a feature where you can manually adjust the tension when a capo doesn t have enough tension it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing initially the planet waves capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first i mean shouldn t it just immediately work after i figured out what worked best for my instrument the capo worked like a charm an additional feature of the planet waves capo is that there is a clip for a pick which is handy if you don t already have an attached pick holder i like it and recommend it for those who might move their capo around to different instruments that have varying neck dimensions
1140	these are laser cut pads for your studio monitors i feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers and they look professional too very good quality cable and plugs easy to make custom length cables from inches to ft my pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that i actually made room for more because there was no extra wire to get in the way these work great keep the guitar case around degrees but do not seem to last as long as they did in the past they are easy to use i continue to buy them because i live in a dry region of the country this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better i can play for hours and my shoulders feel fine i feed the narrow end through of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good well made feels very strong texture is very nice doesnt slip overall a very good product not as good as the g th line of capo but they are about half the price i bought this for a string jumbo acoustic guitar and i was thrilled with the way it sounded so i will probably be using it on my electrics but like i said it good for the price not the best but not the worse this stand works as expected it can hold a guitar all the surfaces that make contact with your instrument are covered with rubber padding which is important only downside is there s no neck support i used this mainly for putting my guitar down when not playing not for displaying
1141	my cry baby is about years old and is the oldest pedal on my board i have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the potentiometer to give the wah a broader range but it really doesn t sound any better this pedal covers the white room by cream tone perfectly i gave it stars because it hasn t been maintenance free the pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives i probably should give it i was looking for a sustainer pedal for my m audio keyboard to use with garageband and found this so i bought it and it works great does exactly what it says it does and actually looks cool it s an amazing tool for keyboard player highly recommended on the plus side it does the job powers your v pedals and doesn t break the bank on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy best to have a noise gate handy just in case i ordered this bench for last christmas i m satisfied so far good value for money the seat is generously padded and is inches thick padding material is not too soft and that is good in my opinion all steel frame construction feels sturdy contrary to one of the reviews my bench came with height adjustment it is not on the fly kind of thing though each of the legs has holes low middle high a fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs and the bolt becomes the crossing point of x three positions roughly correspond to and inches for changing height all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it don t worry you don t need any tool to do the job thanks to a large plastic knob see the picture and you ll understand how it works mine initially came with middle position i also tried high and low but set it back to middle it seems to be a good compromise for my family as the bench is used daily by me my wife and my kids sure it s nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily however with this price i wouldn t complain at all i already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well it was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where i need it holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod they are cheap when bought in the pack and they are very quiet i need to order a couple more packs though i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables they haven t had a huge amount of use but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise and i ve bought over of them
1142	this is not my first guitar nor am i breathless epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of taylors and martins it s not here s what it is an exceedingly well constucted amazingly playable guitar fit finish feel and action were all very nice sound on the other hand let s face it it s plywood all around it sounds like plywood but that doesn t distract from the fact that it s a great guitar for bucks it s a fine first guitar it s a great beach camping cabin guitar leave it in your car to practice at lunch leave it in the office any guitar is better than no guitar and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box new premium strings do make a difference if your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you won t be disappointed if sound quality is your primary concern well you are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy for my desired application this guitar was great i m very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat not that it s a huge deal but i quite prefer this capo over any other capo i ve used it just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that snap into place i own several of these now and whenever i mis place one which happens too often i come back to purchase another if you re looking for a capo i highly recommend using this dunlop model don t panic strings marked a d f b can be used just fine for g c e a tuning they don t seem to be quite as nice as the comparable aquilas but they re half the price they were for a uke and yeah new strings do improve the sound on a uke this stand is very good nice and strong i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this it is worth a lot more then dollars this will last a life time and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash so i looked for something better and i am so happy to have found this at this price i didn t want to pay more then dollars for a stand but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for or dollars and in months its in the trash i would be buying another one so really this is the best deal i am so happy i bought this stand you can t go wrong with this one realy get it it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over its heavy enough not to it slides up and down nicely and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well bolts are not plastic witch is nice and very easy to put together and fast i got it together in one minute i only used regular pliers to put it together the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument i truly recommend this for anyone i did get the foot guards for to protect floor on carpet you will not need them and it comes with a year warranty and with the free shipping you can t beet it my kids are all interested in learning the uke this one really appealed to my son because of the front design plays well and keeps in tune these things are so great i get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and i d have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick with these i can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere the thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups very nice one thing yo note is they like to cling to each other so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it but not that big a deal definitely recommend these if you re sick of picks slipping out of your hands it works really well for tunings other than standard eadgbe i am still trying to get it tuning in standard but so far it s pretty accurate i know it can do standard tuning i just can t figure it out
1143	this bag works perfectly for the digitech rp or pedals of the same size i also use it for an older digitech pedal and works like a charm the construction seems to be sturdy and so far i ve had no problems with the zippers the side pocket is very convenient to store lines and plugs and the handles are very comfortable very good product these screws are not a shiny chrome so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black fender strat body they are good quality screws i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday these are the best strings i ve ever had i love them and may bands use them too these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now well i love da fender products always have always will i recently built me a nice custom strat and had been testing out a few of the various mini tube amps out on the market lately which is where i would categorize this amp even though it has better tubes and more watts these are my comparison testing amps i own both of the amps below and have also tried a number of others in the music store down the road blackheart killer ant blackheart cabinet vox ac tv watt compact all tube practice amp with celestion vx speaker also speakered out to the blackheart cabinet i ve also tested all my amps in various ways by re tubing them with a number of my collected tubes groove tubesjj tubessovtek tubessvetlana tubestung sol tubes gold and straight out of the box this thing beat them all of in sound quality even with what a lot of people are calling a cheap fender speaker version i also plugged the champ into my blackheart speaker cabinet and it sounded even better using my strat but i will do more speaker testing later fender amps have always leaned to sounding better with fender guitars where as gibson epiphone type guitars really sound pretty good on the vox and blackheart models now when this amp came out it was way overpriced but as always that price has fallin into a reasonable range i mean the price of all of these mini tube amps are minimal in comparison to the nicer ones but again this thing is loaded with better guts so maybe that why it screams better ya hoo me likey better guts better performance plus fender has added an extra range of effects and amp sounds its small in size light in weight loud and easy to carry with you for jam sessions i ve had the amp for months or so now and love it it s choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me i don t have the greatest guitar ever but the sounds from the amp are clean and crisp the choice of effects is nice with reverb tremolo delay among other less useful effects the auxillary jack is also a great addition the amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use you ll see much controversy about this device if you read the line forum my own opinion about this is i love it i play the guitar privately not live in public and i have no complaints at all i still use it all the time and learn something new everyday
1144	this product is not what it seems it has a cool name but that s about it it s a tool oil that stinks i tried my best to get use to this product but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the st time after doing away with the fast fret my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty i now use old english and my guitars thank me my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me you will too stripped down one of my basses at the weekend found this very useful made stripping and replacing strings really easy large enough to fit the fender tuners have new sets of strings on order so fitting them won t be as daunting a task as without this item i have used d addario for a number of years i m not hot about their acoustic but electric they re a whole new world i like these nickel on my tele they give them that extra twang very comfortable bench it s wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use it feels heavy duty and stays still during use i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick i saw this and had to try it they are very solid don t bend and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar haven t tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too you need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action not a surprise but the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat anyway these are great guitar picks if you re looking for something solid and long lasting
1145	the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable i did not realized it was double screened until it arrived so it was even better than i had expected as an added bonus one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy i used to buy so for reminiscent s sake i cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording dif you needed a pop filter this will work just as well as the expensive ones and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did buy this product the mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing i switch between playing guitar and bass so i often change the gauge of the pick i am using this pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often the holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not slide around the arm it holds the picks firmly there is no chance they will fall out of the holder don t get me wrong this is a great little amp for practicing but it eats batteries like they were candy i think it was like or three hours of playing and i had to throw in new batteries but if playing on the street corner is your thing this little amp has a belt clip i figured i would take mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing i would suggest getting two packs since you will need pick and the other can go to the children you fathered due to this pic
1146	this tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a reasonably priced product as with any tool there is a small learning curve just to become familiar with the way it functions after using it a couple of times i can only give it high marks well first of all i am a beginner i do not know anything about guitar i saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets mine came yesterday and i am afraid that it would have issue so i brought it to school and let my professor checked for me it surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all the string does not corroded but i changed mine anyway the fret does not have any issue at all and the truss rod adjustment is perfect the action is low and the guitar structure is perfect when my professor starts playing it he was surprised by the sound it produced he thought the guitar cost above he also bought one this morning haha anyways i buy it from amazon and the packaging is great my guitar comes in a perfect condition and i strongly recommended this guitar for anybody don t expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won t be disappointed that said i find it useful for composing on the road heck it even sounds better than my big guitars in an odd way for certain songs nice sturdy and portable case not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask action is adequate for practice with a little tweaking it s actually good quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors exactly what i needed small compact functional and it works no off on power switch though but small consideration when you think about what it can do connect mics ipods mp players and control sound and volume at your fingertips
1147	this mic has amazing quality i was recording my music on a usb condenser mic for about years feels great to finally have professional sounding music check out my soundcloud soundcloud com ljaymusic really dope mic i was looking for a financially good deal the price was so reasonable i said how can something this cheap be that good well they were a great investment i use them all the time and have had people ask me where i purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone when i told them the price they thought i was pulling there leg i wasn t the case is plastic foam and clips three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone now compare for yourself i d buy these again in a heart beat i just might buy another pack bought this to replace my ft mice cable now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want i have never played a string instrument and it looks like i ll be able to get the hang of this very quickly only problem is the strings sting one play s dead meaning it will not stay in tune not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon its a pop filter it works well and does the job however the neck on this thing is a bit long so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way otherwise its a good option at a good price
1148	there s not much to be said about this pedal it just works it s my fourth cheapy behringer pedal and i have been pleased with every one of them this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right i play punk blues and country and this pedal helps me obtain the entire range of sounds necessary for my various styles even on a cheap amp upgrading to a marshall next month this gets the job done people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo it s a good solid plastic that holds up well and if it drops the price to instead of that just makes behringer effects more accessible than that other brand first let me tell you what this pedal can t do it won t do long delays so if you re into the sound of the edge from u or david gilmour look for something else expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile but if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience this pedal will not disappoint analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic users of mxr carbon copy swear by them but for around the rogue pedal will get you close minus the longer delay time i ve read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the belcat and modtone boxes the pedal itself looks sturdy made out of metal compared to my digital delay the rogue sounded warmer although my other delay has a switch for echo that made it warmer too this pedal sounded good and i have no complaints i don t use a long delay time in fact i don t max it out i only use about percent before judging this pedal please experiment on it s placement on your pedal board the user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately it doesn t sound good on my rig placing after the distortion pedal sounded better however everytime i use the dirt channel of my traynor ycv the tone gets muddy now it s in the effects loop just like my other delay the sound has better definition it might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion then after the distortion and finally the effects loop in your amp ultimately you and your gear will have the last say overall a good deal for the price i m thinking of setting up a smaller board of inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome and if anything goes wrong i can easily replace the pedals joyo rogue mooer play on this pedal is very easy to use retro sound is rich with harmonics does have the marshall sound very satisfied
1149	i was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar i would have thought pledge would work but after a little reading i found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance after scoping out amazon i came up with this product and i am happy it makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use it also comes with a nice polishing cloth great deal for the money if all you re looking for is an inexpensive way to hang your guitar until you can afford a good quality leather strap this is it the quality and function of the strap is actually better than i expected for the amount paid i figured i would take mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review the pics shape and thickness is actually perfect twss for playing and gripping also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing i would suggest getting two packs since you will need pick and the other can go to the children you fathered due to this pic these picks are pretty cool fairly stiff despite their thinness they are also a bit pointier than regular picks and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality nice to try something new although they are a bit slippery i ve found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by schaller and dunlop these look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strap i use them on a prs se and i did not need to do any additional drilling the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure highly recommended took it on vacation so i didn t have to leave my axe at home fit right in the guitar case with my headphones got my practice and jamming in everyday with some good tone and effects worth the price and no lugging around a small amp just for practice on the go
1150	this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price this is exactly the item i needed for my podcasting rig it holds my behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box it lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when i need to use my table for something besides podcasting the stand is easy to assemble and is very well built there s nothing bad i can say about it if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up highly recommended i use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out individual volumes controls make it perfect i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio the idea was to give the vocalist instrumentalist personal control over their own levels without the engineer having to change any settings manually the item works great for that as long as you re not using a powered microphone if you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing and interference when the monitor and microphones are plugged in plus the hum buzz is so loud you can t hear anything from the microphone the only way i ve gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a direct box and then into the board i m told that a hum eliminator would do the trick but that s another i really wasn t planning on forking out i d rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalist instrumentalist than pay an extra at the moment again it s very good at what it does if you don t power the microphone as i ve heard with the pyle pro amps i received mine today and it was defective only one channel worked and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep the packaging was very good though so i m thinking this looks like a refurb used and they listed it as new already printed the return shipping label and it will head back to the amazon warehouse on monday this tuner is cool it picks up even the lightest vibrations i e i can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out i also like the capo tuning feature you put a capo on the rd and tell the tuner to flatten x i highly recommend this tuner ok i just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago i did a little comparison to a pretty old sm that i ve have since ish and it was actually very good the pyle has more gain then the old and as for sound i would say they are damn near identical to my ear i did the a b test by mic ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic s in the very same positions i would recommend for sure here s a link to an a b comparison i did with an sm i just recieved these in the mail today and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar not much else to describe they re fairly simple to use and they re selling you of them so i have a spare set now my original pegs were also white on an all black guitar so i m totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar i definitely recommend these for anyone that needs wants black pegs for their acoustic or acoustic electric gutiar
1151	i am a believer that if you have a musical instrument it has to be out if you are going to use it regularly with these sturdy stands my guitars are out and around the house and they seem to talk to me every time that i walk by this encourages if not compulses me to pick them up and play them for minutes at a time these stands are inexpensive light and hold the guitar well i would not recommend them for heavy on the road stage work but then again most of us are not on the road nor the tour we are just playing for the love of it i got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars great little stands at a great price they are sturdy easy to assemble and adjustable i d suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand before i bought this i had to use a tuner on my laptop now i just clip it on to my ukulele and tune it in a matter of seconds i also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument it doesn t matter how much noise there is in the room it still tunes perfectly every time easy accurate and best of all it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing i ve tried other brands and they don t swivel correctly
1152	everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well you have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after the string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise you wont be let down dunlop makes good quality products these are guitar picks and i don t play guitar so i can t say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were i ve been a gigging musician for almost years and this is the most well made most comfortable guitar bass strap i ve ever used pros substantial padding where you need it perfect stitching heavy stiff leather ends soft fine woven material not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps underside is lined with an even softer material makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on did i mention it s super comfortable cons none to speak of seriously it s that phenomenal perfect whether you re rocking a featherweight strat or a pound string bass i use it with a pound string warwick bass and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me i hardly notice i m actually wearing it combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks and it could easily last you years you will not be sorry with this purchase my go to string brand for any stringed instrument punchy round wound tone but very responsive to the tone controls for a more muted sound where required tried this and was not happy seemed to want to be off too much got the fender ft instead this one does have a great view on the led but if it doesn t tune right what s the point i would try the fender just a note if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing just a thought
1153	this thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top i had a lpb that sucked tone and sounded like crap but i really need a line boost and didn t want to spend a lot for one this little baby at about o clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs this mic is strong reliable and produces the sound i m looking for i used to buy all shure products i m switching to gls they are just great for what it does and how i use it this is the hot setup great for a quick practice and really sounds nice wide overdrive and tone range the delay feature is basically a simple slap back echo i d much rather have a chorus in there but for price and the sound i m quite pleased i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments bought this pick looking for options around the old dropped pick syndrome i was skeptical as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most however once between thumb and index finger these darlings hang on
1154	i bought this to replace a behringer uca the behringer performs very well for my use guitar in a home studio but recently it s become way too sensitive to interference i was getting noise from the nearby cable modem router network drives this noise was making its way to my recordings too for what ended up being less than twice the price of the behringer i decided to try this unit not only is it interference free it has a much warmer intimate sound it s usb powered installs automatically in about a minute under win with no issues i did go to the lexicon website and get their driver though just to be on the safe side reaper had new entries for the device in the audio settings panel asio everything just works great first time i was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero latency monitoring on the device great unit i love the behringer but this thing kicks it in the tail when i purchased this pedal from a local music store i wasn t even looking for a double pedal set but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my tama stagestar kit during my quest for a pedal that had the feel i wanted i sat behind a pacific drum kit that had these pedals at first i ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi hat i liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when i decided to see what it was like playing double wow it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable especially cam rotation spring tension and beater offset most of the adjustments require a hex wrench which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals the left side slave pedal has a full floorplate and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle i have tried there is a slight lag on the left pedal which is normal for any double pedal configuration but you ll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal before i purchased this particular model i tried out tama s iron cobra pearl s powershifter and a gilbralter avenger i did not like the stiffness of the iron cobra but did like the pearl and gibraltar pedals it finally came down to either this or the gibralter which was slightly smoother but significantly more expensive i opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal if you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration i strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look more importantly try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price features and quality it has to feel right in addition you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi hat which means that you will need to compensate for that i recommend the gibraltar hi hat drop clutch asin b f yy which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi hat with ease i have my hi hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position but stepping on the hi hat pedal using the clutch puts it in full play position tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal i use this to record my band and other songs into garage band plugged right in no drivers to install computer recognized it immediately i am missing out on a lot of this thing s capabilities by using it only in garageband but for what i need it for it s perfect i use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks i researched a ton before i bought this one touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys i could have got a lot better midi controller but for the money this one suits my band s needs just fine classic tubescreamer tone at the price what s not to love one of my most used pedals great for over driving a clean tone amp i d definitely buy it again construction isn t great but at who cares let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal and tons of fun i can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live but and this is a big but this is my first one star review ever my first less than star review ever same as others switch failed less than ten days of owning it used less than ten times total light use at home i wasn t even wearing shoes by the way a gigging recording musician for over years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff bummer too great idea poorly executed i will not buy anther one i will not recommend to other musicians
1155	as a guitarist who s had the opportunity to work at guitar center back in trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task while i ll chose d addario exl s for electric martin sp are my top choice for acoustic the sound and reliability are unmatched for the money they also have a neat bronze shimmer to them granted that s only aesthetic what you see is what you get it s cheap it s basic and it works the best thing about this synthetic product is the price and color options it s a button it s not fancy it s silver it screwed into my ukulele with no problem and it works very well
1156	the title says it all it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks also since these picks are smaller i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out genius concept it works for me perfectly i no longer lose or misplace my picks easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in it ll depend on where you decide to place this pickholder i placed mine right above the jack plug i ve been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking so far this is the one and i think my search is actually over i ve tried thejim dunlop p dun ultex jazz iii ply pkand that was close but this is the one these davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers doesn t slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs nice thumbpicks for banjo they are size large so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you i have a larger hand and they work well but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug but i like them a lot would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that s whay you re into though i always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick pretty decent sound and it s not too small for an adult to play but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm jazzy tones you can get still very satisfied
1157	very well made no problems should be able to stand up to any use or abuse spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier these can t support heavy stuff and will knock over so easily they sure are portable though not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny this seems like a nice product but maybe i m doing something wrong i can t get the bottom guitar support to lock in place it twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place maybe there is something i need to do differently it s really not a w system the booklet even says it is only watts and i doubt it is really even that powerful the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar but it s not watts loud i guess it s ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless unless you have a mixer you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this really puts out the sound though and i guess that s what you get an amp for i used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to to fill the place very nice effects on both channels
1158	these cables have taken a beating the last few months and have served me well with no problems real metal ends not molded on with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors now a days i just search amazon because they have always got what i want at reasonable prices this is no exception i am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my epiphone les paul custom pro to the guitar guy for setup etc this was was better then i expected it is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit in other words great all around i know it sits on a self with many other guitars when i take it in to the guitar guys so i am perfectly confident that it is well protected and it is lockable with key if you are looking for a more then good case for your epi lp just get this one you will not be disappointed also i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day no special shipping maybe it is my locations but that was great too well packed this was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on it s easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops i recommend it to all aspiring musicians a great deal here on amazon these cost a lot more a few years ago it appears chief bought raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing the shelf i received has slots all over it instead of a bunch of screw holes this makes it really easy to mount things i m ordering more of these they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets good luck and good music to all yes i would buy is a great strap nice comfort nice pricefits nice in to my fender guitar a thumbs up yep it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar i have a washburn rover a backpacker style and so a stap is a necessity and this works just great
1159	sounds and feels nice i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster it came with entry level strings these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument be advised the low e string is thick when i try to depress the th fret i can t get it to register as a hit with rocksmith unless i press hard with my middle or index finger well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game its very useful looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand very durable as well i had a friend with one of these and he loves it i got one on his recommendation and when i put the batteries in it it started smoking it did work for awhile i pulled the batteries out and tried to ac adapter and it smoked again this time it did not work i am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work holds a grudge i would not advise anybody to get this this will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster it will also give you a rhythm track to play along too the rhythm machine has rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo it is not perfect as it has no on off switch it reverts to default mode when you power it up it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats it only cost around so perfection should not be expected for practice and the home studio it is great the cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling maybe it s just me but that s how they come across i noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel but don t lose that new sound new as fast i didn t have near as much string stretch with these either i ll keep using them just maybe in a different gauge
1160	the handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar and i feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it s unpleasant to use hurts the fingers it s cheap and easy to use it ll do the job but i don t like it it s survived my clumsiness and i can load it with pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat i heard great things about the s and so being a novice without any idea of what to buy i bought it based upon reviews i ve played it for a year and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars here are my humble thoughts the seagull is comparatively unattractive its snake head headstock with the tiny not great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar the cedar top is very nice looking and the rosewood fretboard bridge on mine are very nice the laminate sides back seem much thicker than competing guitars and this makes the guitar heavier and to me less alive resonant during playing the satin finished cedar top is very easy to marr the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force but at a heavy strum the top seems to bottom out and lose definition the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok the binding is a sharp degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing something i ve not encountered before i can get the action very very low before the frets rattle nice all in all it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it s made in canada for asian mexican prices that said just because it comes from canada doesn t embody it with mystical vibes in fact for the price range i can get a just as good asian mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back front sitka spruce solid top wood better tuners and a more attractive headstock with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good i don t regret getting it but i feel like i overpaid for what i received and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade s exchange rates i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price seagull to me is over hyped thanks for reading
1161	excellent quality and craftsmanship i was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do i figured it would be made out of a cheap feeling metal i was wrong it is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe it is strong to it feels like i could really bang it i won t and it would not break i use this with an audio technica at which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base the mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still it does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk or whatever that will still come through it looks cool too and everybody knows that matters i am very pleased with this purchase the reverb broke in my amp and i tried the boss frv to replace it and didn t really like it too much then i read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby this is exactly what i wanted it fills out the sound and yet doesn t add any artificial high end sounds gorgeous for what i do which is playing alone in a basement for most songs it s always on and it really excels at vintagy sounding stuff like rockabilly and surf the mod button is a nice add on but i haven t really bonded with it yet if i had to buy this over again i might consider the aqua puss because i don t use the high delay times all that much and the aqua puss has an easy access battery door this works well a few cons it is not variable speed on off in either direction with full torque not so bad but variable speed would have been nice it is a little loud other than that does what it should as expected for a cheap pedal i gave this a try very versitle can get many different types of sounds and drive from it the knobs are a little tight but that just makes feel tough i guess i like much more than the joyo fuzz this can give some cleans and drive to distortion you really need to work with it a bit with your amp and find that sweet spot certainly not the best overdrive distortion or effects pedal i have used but for the budget i do receomend it it is cheap and very has a good range of tone options i ran it into a fender camp and they seemed to get along well hope this helps tried these on les paul style with jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about different pedals metal overdrive echo reverb fuzz etc so keep in mind that they haven t broken in yet as i do this review but i do feel confident in what i report here they are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels on the high gain metal muff fullbore guytone metal monster swollen pickle and big muff they sound really nice a lot of harmonics and output captured for that stars easy i don t think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold other s may feel differently i am sure then again ernie ball even states they are very bight high output so you are getting what they say however for a warm bluesy tone i couldn t get anywhere close to my sound like i can with the pure nickels for that star average to i guess forget about the nickel wound steel all together those are really lame either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment for shredding go cobalt for warm woman tone go pure nickels that s pure folks i also really like the d addario pures also these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel hope this helps
1162	thankfully i still have most of these picks i m always losing them but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on works really well this is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something you can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready these strings are different and really quite nice the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings i really like them only possible difficulty is that high e etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string i have a bunch of these on hand for my strat and my epiphone as well the standard earnie balls guitar pics what more can i say nice feel and look never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft this tuner is wonderful you can tune all strings in same time it s halpfull in stage because you don t need to test each string individually
1163	this is the best one out there bar none really this is a keeper wish it came in different neon colors as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage that would make this one the best d addario makes a pretty good string but i d have to say i prefer the elixir the sound is a little brighter and the strings last longer with elixir don t get me wrong though i still like these if there s a sale i ll buy some more levy s leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material especially on the edges it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt yukko the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap nice pic s that work well when you are really jammin on a tune can t complain about a price like this does the job just fine for what it is not really anything more you could ask for comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most if not all microphones folds up nice and small happy all around i love the hola small instrument stand it is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when i go to the ukulele club it has a nice rubber padding so i trust putting my instrument on it i have a tenor ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand it is very lightweight which is also a plus i use the stand at home too i stand my ukulele on it because sometimes i play and then i want to go to youtube to listen to a particular song it is very convenient i have recommended this stand to others also features i like lightweight sturdy and folds up easily
1164	my takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job the quality seems to be good and installation went fine for those of you who are unsure about drilling a hole into the guitar i would only recommend drilling into cheaper guitars unless you know what your doing of course it is lined and has a pouch for song books great price and great product if you are looking for a soft case this is a great option i first bought the yamaha mg c mixer but it arrived defective so i returned and bought this instead first impression of profx is very good it s a lot more durable heavy than the mg c and the knobs are constructed much better for example all the knobs that have centering dent on mg c doesn t line up well some are off by a few degrees but on this profx every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm really like the eq on the main output as well as mute on every channel build in fx effects are okay you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anything when using usb to do recording with audacity there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording regardless if microphone channel is turned off or not microphone preamp is so so i guess i have a akg d and sm with both mics i have to turn gain and channel volume to to get a decent output but it does the function perfectly runs a little bit on the hot side power cable is kinda short so you may want to look for a longer one
1165	there are something special about these strings they ring so bright and beautiful i absolutely love them for my fenders i honestly don t use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele they re gorgeous sounding especially when new these fender pickguard screws are excellent they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment i replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they re much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent bought these for my squire strat i was changing the look with new pickgaurd nobs and switch tips these nobs fit great and look great i would difenantly recomend them restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle a great investment that ll last quite a long time tried this and was not happy seemed to want to be off too much got the fender ft instead this one does have a great view on the led but if it doesn t tune right what s the point i would try the fender just a note if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing just a thought
1166	these mopads are pretty amazing i recently just purchased the atlantic gaming desk so i had a feeling that i would need these pads these pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk i love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up these pads make my bookshelf speakers sound amazing it s like i m using actual studio monitors at you can t go wrong with these pads for you studio it is a must to have these i ve been using elixers on my godin multiac steel sa for many years now they have a great not too bright sound and you don t get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings these tend to last me about months so i am very happy with them they also track pretty well with my roland synth so no gripes there all in all i really like these strings and think they sound great the dunlop neck cradle is well designed and firmly supports the neck of any guitar it is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze buy one and i am sure you will like it as well as i if your a beatle fan or just someone who collects picks this is the perfect item for you great graphics i m a guitar pick collector and this is by far the best that i have so if you don t have this beatle set go and get it this has been a very good purchase i have not stopped using it since i got it good and prompt service as well thanks again cheers
1167	the description says the color is gold it s not more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for i think i would stick with the black color though this pedal works like a charm stays in place and works as de scribed i would buy this again if i needed to replace it great heavy picks amazingly cheap price you really can t go wrong i lose my picks continually bermuda triangle in my laundry and this has been great to have an endless supply this amp is awesome its great just like it s advertised i play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the fender fuse software fender fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire the amp itself has presets as advertised are shown in different colors red green orange and you can totally customize the presets so if you want different distortions go for it another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials learn how to use it record some music but you can t save them bummer i know but it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings one last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal about the fender mustang can only use the button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses buttons or up can only be use by fender mustangs up remember this
1168	the best thing i ve purchase for my guitars this year i m not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning the and are the best restore the live of my fretboard the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine the only one that i ve just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don t play with it after the cleaning but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner you can buy this with your eyes close you wont regret the purchase serves its purpose worked better when i added a quick disconnect attachment quality finish comfortable and enough range to adjust as needed i bought a cheap rogue a mandolin and after setting it up i of course replaced the cheap factory strings i put these on and what a difference these aren t too heavy not too light they ring nicely i find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner like dunlop ultraglide can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin added a couple drops and it worked like a charm a must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin great product great price buy it as a pro musician my entire teenage and adult life i say ya good capo yes i bought and they fit all my guitars mandolins ukulele bass very easy to install on the wall
1169	i ve had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this i recently bought it for my niece and taught her how to change her strings the different size gaps make it grab the tuning pegs much better than my old one i was able to use it on an electric steel string acoustic and classical and it grabbed them all rather well the string cutter works well and the peg puller does also so handy elixir makes the best guitar strings electric and acoustic they last forever and don t rust they sound awesome get them as a professional guitar player i am always nervous playing a show with old strings however i ve been using elixir for over years now and the strings really do last a long time i would usually replace my strings every month but i ve started leaving them on for up to months have to reorder soon great strings for the money i play guitar with a cou ple of my buddies and they love them too sound quaility is great these pins are amazing one u never have to worry about breaking them they look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain very cool these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar they are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex we ve tried d addario brighter sound d addario acoustic guitar strings set exp lite and martin a little stiff martin strings sp phosphor bronze msp in the end these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar the difference between these strings nanoweb and polyweb the nano s have a very light coating that you almost don t feel so if you like standard not coated strings the nano s are probably the way to go if you want a bit of softness the polys are a better bet as has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar for the combination we have these are outstanding strings on the strings lasting longer that s hard to say fresh strings do sound better it s clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non coated strings but i m not certain these last so much longer we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them playability corrosion or crud on the string isn t the sole factor in changing strings elixir is a wonderful company on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesn t perform up to your standard the other amazing thing i ve watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and i m still very confused the elixir website it s pretty simple elixirstring dot com is outstanding ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings i swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes it is so simple and so reproducible i love this technique i clipped it on the neck head of my acoustic guitarit tunes up well and is very easy to readi turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingi have not used it enough to test the battery lifebut so far so good great for the price all pros and no cons so far
1170	this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer it works as expected and has proven to be durable i don t hesitate to drop it in my gig bag knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band i also wanted to use it on my xbox to play guitar hero and rock band but it s not recognized by either game as a mic that was surprising since it s a usb mic it is a tiny mic it ll fit completely on your palm but it can record very loud noises very clearly it is also very sensitive when set to room recording excellent product the latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device i ve yet found the blue microphones yeti usb microphone long known for their line of high end condenser microphones blue is increasingly known for their computer ready usb microphones like the snowflake and the snowball and the yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer ready microphone yet advertised as the first fully thx compliant a standard devised by lucasfilms microphone the yeti is a large tall on its removable stand hefty multi pattern microphone suitable for recording podcasting or any other computer related audio activity it features four switchable patterns omni carodid figure eight and stereo a built in headphone amplifier gain control headpohone volume and a mute button for even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard microphone stand or boom and it sounds great too even better than their well regarded snowball series i ve been using it for recording music practice building tracks with audacity on my windows and linux boxes and with apple s garageband and making calls with skype the ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus up to now i ve been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an a d converters a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home the yeti has it all in one package it may not sound quite as good as a multi thousand dollar condenser microphone and vacuum tube preamp but for the money it simply can t be beat works solid looks solid and had a good price i would recommend it to anyone i really like this pop filter
1171	they re very thin nylon picks they re good for practicing the hand motions of strumming they put up very little resistance so they train you to keep your hand stable i still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone but i usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums i also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don t notice with a thicker pick they re great for what they are thin flexible picks and amazon has the best price this is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out the wire cutters also work really well im glad i bought this product they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a very long time and their sound is great these strings are not focused on performance but endurance best string i ve ever played the reason i bought them is i only needed a few i live in bfe and there is no real place to buy any on my drive home from work so i got these and delivered to my doorstep all is well with the world
1172	i won t rant about a string winder they aren t that technical of an item but i do like the string cutter i do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but i am not going to be that picky this unit works just fine and i am sure that i will lose it before it breaks really great clamp fastens to a vertical pipe very securely great quality a very nice addition to my collection i highly recommend i use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage rigid easily adjustable and inexpensive lighter than a full boom this little stand serves so many purposes for me at home it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when i want to test out different pedal configurations at my gig it holds my presonus mixer a laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers it is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide and short or tall as well i have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it i plan on using this one day to hold my ableton live machine as well as a small octave keyboard and i will use the mic boom arm at that point even as a keyboard stand i like it because i can put pedals underneath it with it fully extended to long mode i can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it of course that is solid inches of stage front though which is indeed a lot for the small places i fit into with my duo
1173	this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price i have absolutely no complaints this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar d addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the elixir s these are very nice bright strings the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings i like that compared to elixir s these are a bit brighter with good feel call me old school i hate the packaging these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag ah you know i m just so used to strings that are individually looped two strings looped together makes a mess while i m restringing a guitar when i unwrap that pair i ve got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench the neat freak in me hates that i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible but darn it paper envelopes it feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials not some environmental cause post consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load i know d addario loves the color coded ends on my acoustic guitar that s irrelevant the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs on my electric guitars i don t like the look at all i prefer gold or silver rings at the end if the strings are in individual labeled packages there s no need for the colors d addario loves the color coded end rings so much they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging i have yet to decode their colors or naming system i normally use gauge strings in my acoustic guitar i tested these at gauge and am surprised how much i like them the slightly thicker string is not bad oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixir s my reason for using the original d addario strings is low price if somebody is doing gigs nightly those uncoated strings are the only way to go strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician for the home enthusiast coated strings make a ton of sense they do last longer i think they are worth the premium price now there are two choices for excellent coated strings in the end the packaging the color coded end rings the crazy package coding and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar what they sound like and play like is the most important thing and in that regard these are excellent strings i feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing it works great thank you nady and amazon it s compact and great to use i m mainly a guitarist but i do play bass from time to time on an old fender american these strings are very bright in a good way with a clear smooth sound i love the tone you get out of these very bluesy and the punch isn t too rough it s just right i m a huge fan of d addario been using their strings for at least years and they never disappoint give these a try if you re looking for some new strings excellent tone and i m a bit surprised by that i mean d addario strings are fine and all but that s it they ve always just been your average basic string to me these promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver i strung up my agile al best les paul copy you can buy look them up with them tuned up and these things roared rich full harmonic tone with plenty of bend and sustain these strings really do feel and sound great i never thought i d be praising d addario so much but these strings really do deliver
1174	i ve always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees all the way up to you chest the strap never fails i ve owned countless ernie ball straps and i always come back to them for the main reason i ve never had one fail a great strap for a great price i really like this strap it s comfortable adjusts easily and the pick holder is really convenient this is my second one for my other guitar the knobs are a little sketchy they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong but the sound is just great this little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail i may buy a second one as a backup behringer hit a home run with this one not just a great sounding pedal for the price but an honest to goodness great sounding od pedal no true bypass but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you won t detect any tone suck it sounds good enough that i don t mind the lack of true bypass i don t know much about delay and i ve never really used it this is a fun pedal for a simple cool delay kinda makes you aware of what you are playing fun with blues chorus sound yep easy to use and accurate only issue in tuning drop d or b on a string bass it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it it tends to fall off quickly on low notes microphone works well for acoustic guitars
1175	this is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne the only issue i have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post not a big deal i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer i am very happy with how it performs in both situations high quality solid support and good design decisions all around the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to i will try to add pictures when i get a chance this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also
1176	i am an acoustic guitar addict with five six string and one twelve i play every day and in a year s time i go through a lot of strings over the years i have come to favor the phosphor bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument for a long time i believed that brands of them were interchangeable so i bought whatever was available at the best price no more these d addarios are the sweetest easiest to play and not that this is the most important variable to me the longest lasting of any of the phosphor bronze strings i have used there is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened martins gibsons ghs adamas and elixirs as well as other varieties of d addario strings i think it s time to sell them off these exp s are superior to them all i have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong to play as well as i am able i require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up sound wise i look for a blend of brightness and warmth on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar these d addarios do both things and do them well other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the slickness of these strings i simple did not experience that at all as with all guitar strings they should be wiped with a dry lint free cloth after each and every playing not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of any string as a bonus the price of these strings is quite reasonable i bought sets and plan to use them all both mediums and lights for my stringed friends having played guitar for years i have tried and used many many capos back in the day it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic it didn t work very well but it is what was available to me later some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place and in tune as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar without doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar s neck many good capos have been made until now perhaps the best options have been g which fails in its softness that allows strings to slip and schubb which unfortunately snaps into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument this new ns tri action capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively designed by ned steinberger the ns the tri action works on a trigger spring lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck fits perfectly on the first attempt holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar both the g s and the schubbs are better known more commonly used and more expensive this is one of those rare instances where what you get is not what you pay for d addario the famous string maker that produces the planet waves line of guitar accessories has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos any guitar player who has gone from one to the other capo over time searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time will find this new capo from planet waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six string guitar this is the best capo we have out of three we were not unhappy with the others until we received this one pros easy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tune easy to put on the guitar although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they don t buzz it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fret nice pick holder feature the micro adjuster is easy to adjust it turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring cons none this is the capo to get
1177	i have been using these for about years now i am very happy with these strap locks great product these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice i bought a number of these because after the first one i used i fell in love they have a fuller sound than other picks and the grip on these is fool proof however they don t pinch harmonics well at all and they will not do scrapes up the low strings at all two disasters for classic rock music i never seen picks that wouldn t do these things however i really struggled with these things that seem so easy with other picks however minus these two quirks these are fantastic picks the best eb slinky s i ve ever used on these i use the light s s even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well i use them on all of my guitar s two fender american standard s gibson es gibson les paul with bigsby i always have a set in each case try um ya won t regret it
1178	i use the mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years the non slip surface doesn t take long to wear off but i have a work around i ve even put them in a vice and filed new points on them i prefer an extra heavy pick because there s no delay from pick deflection i ordered these picks in bulk to use while i was recording producing i absolutely love these picks and swear by them i ve been a guitarist for almost years and these were the picks that i landed on years ago and stuck to i ve had years of lessons licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for rhythms i d order again if i had to what can you say about a foam ball type mic windscreen well it fits the rode m mic i was using nice and tight quality is good didn t tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine this was recommended by a guitar repair shop and i have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand it will polish and lube things like floyd roses do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil wipe them down with a little dr duck s ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case the secret is always use the least you can get away with too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever i have moved on to the carbon fiber and mm lexan jazz iii picks but these ultex picks are also very nice they are a little less bright than the carbon fiber picks which in some cases is actually preferrable in my opinion at least at the moment the jazz iii picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy once you get used to the small size there is no going back the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator for connecting pedals in tandem got two of these three packs been using them for quite some time and not one has failed yet nice value as well i have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables they haven t had a huge amount of use but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise and i ve bought over of them i really like the soft flexible cable these have they were perfect for my pedal board highly recommended you will find yourself wanting more than you purchased these will not wear down which is amazing and they have all the same great qualities as all the other jazz iii s the only problem i have with them is dirt can get between the grip pretty easily which makes them slip but if you clean them well then its not a problem
1179	this fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up the fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy it s ok but not the best fog machine out there i bought them at dollars use for small music gigs and dj mc uses they are great for dj uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn t so important as long as you can be heard and understood i recommend for use of small music venues smaller bands djing public speaking band practices rehearses etc for higher quality microphones at a reasonable price look at the audix om when it s around bucks or audio technica products despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely these are lasers you can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace i haven t tested the sound feature but i ve seen it on videos i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained what was thought to be a doa model ended up being a mistake on my behalf my iphone s which i have had for about a year now must ve had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine unless trying to use the jam in the box comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps it comes with the jam and two cables usb and ios it is bigger than i had imaginedit s almost the length of an iphone feels nice and is very light the cords aren t very long the product is here and i am glad the size is right the colors punch out nice and will help my vocal mics last longer so singers don t drool on my mics and help out during soundcheck hey can we get blue turned down a little products were intact but on an quick examination i saw small tears in the foam i will update if that matters in the long run
1180	this amp sounds great looks great works great and is a breath of fresh air from modelling amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five flavor settings in each they are all on one dial and there is no pushing pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you ve switched gears here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar microphone for singing drum machine the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you d have to be right up on them to see how they are set i ve had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned it s velcroed on there just fine the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather like material plenty loud i use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it a day doesn t go by where the stand is not in use i bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was easy to use and handy for any string instruments only thing i regret is not getting one sooner i play guitar bass and violin and more i have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay in fact that may be saying too much i was really surprised at the snark sn tuner i found it very accurate i compared it to my boss tu tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter i decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the snark no one would ever do this this was a test and it was very close to my stroboscope i plan on buying the higher quality snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter very impressed with this if i can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board i will be happy these are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so i don t have to move it around as i change guitars during performances
1181	good idea tends to slip on the strings however convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck it s not bad it would be better if i bought one large enough for my finger still i d rather stick with a copper slide this tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone or direct plug in for electric instruments this has the microphone feature but is better used with the clip on vibration mode just clip it on to your guitar head and hit the string a multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat easy to use i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews i have five guitars including two les paul s and they hold them just fine i give them four stars the are fine for i believe all guitars at home but i wouldn t use them for retail or something like a school they are made if abs plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it s just a rivet the holds them together the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke like the other reviewer said you really should find a stud to mount them to but if you must use wall anchors use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall all in all these are sturdy and stable when anchored to a stud and i ll use more if i have the need
1182	i do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos and after using this filter the pop that occurs with p s and b s in the voice are basically gone it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand solid heavy base well built does the job of holding a mic no more no less i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig i am a bass player by trade though i dabble with many other instrument as many of us do i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows when the sound system is adequate via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there for being a thin flexible cable i notice no noise issues or interference problems i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals and then to the mixer i use the at xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables this cable at least in its form sounds just as good as my mogami silver xlr i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic i have several i don t have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables on short i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm or similar dynamic microphone but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power into a plug n play usb mic should not be taken at face value i say this because i have an acquaintance with the original audio technica at condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion in the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks by purchasing the at usb mic as it is the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the comparably priced lightsnake cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read so if necessary give it a try and more than one but make sure there are return privileges
1183	after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric lbs and liking them i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric lbs noproblem just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars it s a nice convenience if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions you ve got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly what i don t care for but feel okay with because they work so well is how big they seem to be theydon t get in the way when being used but look almost out of place that is why i chose black for mysecond set helps keep the product s profile down a bit other than that the product works asadvertised note as of june i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings i love this little item i was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new fender but i love it no more hunting for picks anymore when i am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it s always there when i pick up the guitar placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar i placed mine where i d never rub against it between the amp cord inlet and a control knob make sure it isn t in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it i love this and have one coming for my acoustic too only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar oh i use medium picks and fit easily into the holder and wouldn t try to squeeze another on in but that s why you have a gig bag anyway this is a must have item in my opinion tubulaarrrrholds my string string acoustic etc has held up very sturdily over the year i ve had it or so idk why gc does not carry these annoying great pick worth buying a baggie if you like the ultex feel but hate the in store larger only ones get these
1184	these cables work very well at transmitting sound so why only three stars well these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find these are stiff thick and heavy while that s good for most analog cables these cables are so stiff and heavy that for instance a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there with so many amps having plastic jacks these days you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one i mean let s face it you never know what will happen at a gig sometimes you re playing with a foot cable when you should have a foot cable a cable shouldn t come out because of a gentle pull but if it s between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it you want the cable to fall out if everything you have is heavy or velcro d to the ground this isn t a problem but it is for me i feel like when you re playing with these cables you re worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out but because it s seriously like a trip wire out there lastly these plugs are huge that s not really a problem if you play a strat or a tele but what about a p bass or a j bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body this is going to stick out a lot and to loop it around your strap it s going to be a huge stiff cumbersome loop i know people often buy degree plugs for those kinds of instruments but most normal straight plugs do just fine so yeah if you like to move around on stage get more flexible cables you ll thank me these cables are just poorly thought out they d work great as patch cords or keyboards drum machines from pedal board to amp as long as you have a metal jack monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use and at that price pro co cables are also excellent and they have brand name plugs as well i have many planet waves cables they all work well are well constructed and are a good value i would highly recommend any plant waves cables i use this at home on my project studio it works great for headphone sessions i use it all the time to run an extra set of headphone in to my vocal booth closet it s all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn for the money you can t beat it its not professional quality but ive done some professional quality work with it with no problem easy to use and accurate only issue in tuning drop d or b on a string bass it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it it tends to fall off quickly on low notes microphone works well for acoustic guitars cool tuner i have this on my pedal board and it works really well very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isn t on
1185	fantastic just love this little amp at first thought it was broken but batteries were not sitting in right very happy it s ok i bought a couple to replace some of my old rusty chrome stands and was skeptical at first i have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical have bought several more great for the beginner this is an amazing guitar i couldn t put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars my beater acoustic i was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all i couldn t imagine what i would b getting for by was i wrong it s my best acoustic currently this thing sounds like sustains and holds its own tune like a similar martin model and that s zero exaggeration get it and see you will be blown away i bought a second one i just wish i had found this guitar sooner very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it i would recommend this product to a friend
1186	i bought this for an accousic guitar then i had to have one for a mandolin and now i also have one for a square neck dobro some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don t leave much room for a leather strap some case manufacturers have the same problem this item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap the dobro had the issue with the strap didn t have a great connector i bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon i wasn t planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar the way the military palletizes all of its cargo i figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it but i took the chance anyway it arrived intact and ready to play the strings are a bit cheap but the guitar itself is well made and has a really nice rich tone i was planning on giving it away when i left but i am shipping it home instead and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home but it is worth it this one has worked out so well i am taking a chance on a string soon to arrive in theater daddario s are my go to strings for my washburn and ibanez acoustics they sustain well great tone tune well and last for a good while between changes these are great guitar straps at a very reasonable price i bought to try them out and i intend on buying more the danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with v to v by giving less power to them you can get some really spooky sounds great fun but can also help give you your characteristic sound i also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it like other adapters do the price is great i m planning to have several of this i used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly i bought my dad one too he loves it too
1187	i was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones they are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones but the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music i say go for dr dre beats if you want to know what the noise isolation feels like just putting your hands on your ear on the plus side these monitors look and feel amazing they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat they don t sound horrible i mean they are not computer speakers or anything the sound is very forward i would say harsh that s not uncommon among studio monitors there is definitely a lot of clarity here not a ton of bass but that s pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size there s a few schools of thought on studio monitors some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music others think they should sound more like a normal speaker these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this any flaws would be quite noticeable i previously used krk rp s so i can compare these to them granted they are larger and more expensive although they are also budget monitors i liked them better than these they were clear but also sounded nicer and of course had much more bass i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in see if i could improve the situation but one of the speakers starts to buzz about minutes after it s turned on the buzz increases in volume over time i tried moving them to a different location turning the volume down even disconnecting the audio feed so they were only plugged into the power nothing stopped the buzz if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again the buzz starts up in more like or seconds so i sent them back i wasn t really impressed with the sound and i m definitely not satisfied with the quality control so i m going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead maybe behringer a s or something i think it s worth an extra dollars or so to get a full sized monitor got this because i thought the length would be enough it was but i wanted more mobility so went to the longer length had no problems with this cable though works great i use these cables in my home hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors they appear to be very well built and sound just fine i have had them for several months and they are working perfectly highly recommended for the price good sound very very low noise except on high gain when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half expensiveif you re planing to record on computer buy a usb mixer for the same price you ll get a lot of stuff and a mixerworks with ios if you have an external power supply powered hub
1188	the thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one no pun intended you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice i ve used many different types of picks over the years and i ve not found the ideal one for me until recently when i decided to use a silverpick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which i find fits my needs the best and so far it s just a case of getting used to it this particular dunlop pick is as described being fat stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face the hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard this makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing for me though i ll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it s not my default or preferred choice for play holds my guitars just fine it is a bit odd to think that something off balance one of the legs is shorter then the others will be fine but it works i don t know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case this one surpassed my expectations months into using the gig bag and not a single problem the pockets are packed with books tools and strings the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze these dava picks are very nice they are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick the rubber grip area is great the feel is soft just perfect for holding a long time the dunlop picks with the bumps are nice but this just feels a lot better between my fingers there are three little lines at the center of the pick the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex this is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there isn t much of an effect no matter where i place my fingers the effect is subtle at best the only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short the rubber can end up striking the string overall i like these picks a lot the colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand
1189	these are my go to strings they are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding what more do you need nice basic guitar strap great price and should last long enough i have started using the padded levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap this can be a little scratchy in the reviews for this item there seems to be a lot of debate over what the fender mini tone master is and how we should evaluate it is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier do we review it compared only to other mini amps or do other small combos costing under creep into the discussion well i bought one for myself and the conclusion is this it isn t the best way to practice guitar quietly at home but it s also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you d expect appearance durability actually the aesthetics of the mini tone master are one of my favorite things about it this is a conversation piece that i wouldn t mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies it just so happens that it s a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also the component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap yet are put together in a convincing way take a step back and you d swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather the grill cloth over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers actually while the amp is cheap it s also fairly durable in fact i just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review and it seems to be working fine phew it should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a v battery or a v dc adapter a boss pedal supply adapter will work for example while the battery option is obviously nice for portability the red on light seemed noticeably dimmer with v s and i can t say how long the battery will last if you plan to have it in one place most of the time the adapter is the preferred way to go sound the concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it a one watt output with twin speakers given that each speaker is smaller than the tweeter on a large stereo speaker you won t be surprised at all to hear that there s virtually no bass in the sound it sounds like a poor w solid state amp only shrunk down to a few inches at the same time that s kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier and it puts out a fair amount of sound i opted for the mini tone master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones low gain high volume produces pretty good clean tones and with humbuckers and the gain turned up it can get a bit raunchy unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally i haven t figured out which yet i had it at most of the time but it didn t seem to cut much treble as i turned it up actually it got the brightest around and then almost became more muffled beyond that but again for a mini amp my expectations were not that much to begin with i do like the four knobs and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on off flat toy switch i expected the speaker to overdrive break up if you pushed it too hard and not in a tube like manner that wasn t necessarily the case but there are other problems something internally rattles after the volume goes above and it s not the speaker being overpowered this is a common issue with cheap amps and i might even pop it open to see what is rattling around and the sound quality isn t objectively good by any means but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style alternatives the primary reason i rated this instead of really isn t any of the issues above i am happy with the amp but it s limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home quiet practicing my favorite of these by far are the vox amplugs which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers the sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality and volume fullness than anything this mini amp could do also they are offered at or so it s simply a better value another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software while sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps the possibilities for effects modeling and recording are endless if you think about recent improvements in small size bluetooth speakers you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the mini tone master offers at the same time those speakers can cost up to and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp your opinion of it will depend on your expectations but if you don t take it too seriously it s a cool little device and in my book anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at great picks not just for jazz though i play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel but once you do they are fantastic these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice nice grip sound articulate durable nice i own hundreds of picks and this is my new favorite i bought gauges both are going to be used for years
1190	i almost always play finger style without a pick but on the occasion i need a pick i like these easier to strum sounds good to me if you re doing a lot of picking out individual strings you ll probably want something thicker but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good plus pick out a few strings here and there not sure how to rate this tube replaced a chinese preamp tube in my champion and couldnt tell any difference in tone maybe it is built better but thats yet to be seen i did put a eh v in with the chinese preamp tube and did notice an improvement but the eh v only lasted five minutes and shorted out so i sent it back i ordered a ts v and am still waiting for it maybe nos is the way to go with the preamp tubes time will tell i really like the foot switch seems well made for the price and works as advertised i just needed something to change channels on my fender super champ xd excellent pedal i love this chorus it is perfect to me the effect is really great mxr has a very good quality i bought the special pro pack keys g a c love them was using cheep pidmont blues harps toys i had to have more like an addiction i bought a d then this bb then e won t be long i ll get a f this harp bb has a beautiful tone always loved the sound of the bb made in germany quality musical instrument not a toy if you own special s then you already know how good they are if you don t try one you might end up with like me or more in no time worth every cent if they are good enough for john popper bob dylan they re good enough for me a pleasure to play joe
1191	i use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over its worked great very happy with it its not a quality mic but it its a good mic for the money some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter works well it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically i find myself using it a lot even as i learn the notes on the guitar fret board if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note i also use it to intonate my guitar it has some other advanced features but i haven t need them display is nice and large even though i still need my reading glasses to see the note quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any ernie ball products great very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces i have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record the notes don t bend easily if you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quickly these are little more than toys compared to dollar harps they feel cheap but have a decent sound i dont know if they will last but to make harp noises without decent bends ill use these sparingly jim i purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and kicking the tires of this one and it s competition i will tell you up front my decision to buy the dr mkii over the zoom h came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer i m a musician and a wanna be videographer since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test i read about dr mkii vs zoom h and listened too on youtube i decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same size most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between and don t even have high quality microphones so discovering i could toss an mp of the song i was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise this is the better choice for musicians other features i appreciate about the dr mkii the adjustable microphones quick turn on and being armed to record the file system the low battery consumption i should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record after all everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up power it up and start recording well i got a recording without sound the unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero once i figure that out all was right again in my universe you will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation i found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing the more aggressive recording level solved that problem i purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process i have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results i still don t know how i will solve the wind noise issue when recording ambient sound microphone capsules facing out since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the xy pattern position i m sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though for my video work i use inexpensive hd capable camcorders my new fascination is with the song bloggie swivel camera lense they are inexpensive now on craigslist these days and with the dr mkii all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality i get from the bloggie one last detail at the point of purchase i discovered amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the dr mkii to the same price point as the zoom h win win i got what i expected with my purchase you will too the dp ex pocketstudio is the next generation design of the dp digital portastudio i have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the dp ex on its own terms pointing out features and issues important to me mostly workflow related as someone who grew up home recording with analog equipment if you want all the details of the full functionality i d recommend downloading the manual from tascam or a dealer site that offers it speaking of the manual i found it to be essential at least at first there are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy or better yet downloading a second copy is a good idea this is picky but i found the larger size of the dp manual easier to read and handle than the smaller dp ex i ve used software based daws for years and while i enjoy midi recording mixing and editing with them basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when i used analog equipment i have a one room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and aside from pc noise i miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old mk ii cassette track instant power on press record pause ready set go granted i don t miss the wall of hiss that plagued those recordings but i had fun capturing a lot of musical moments using a hardware control surface with my daw didn t solve the problem i just find the reality of booting windows dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment especially when recording acoustic instruments i hoped the dp ex would provide some of that older experience with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup the bottom line for me is it does and it doesn t first some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions size wise the difference between porta and pocket studios is roughly x x inches versus x x inches tascam doesn t provide a case or cover for the dp ex but a larger ereader or tablet case should do fine and i d recommend one if you plan on portable use the plastic appears fairly durable but it s still plastic the knobs on the dp ex are smaller in diameter lower and have rounded tops compared to those on the dp however i find their slightly rubbery matte finish just as easy to grip i also find the smaller circular pushbuttons on the dp ex don t protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar shaped buttons on the dp and are less comfortable to use the data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the dp ex which i prefer the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus you ll need the dedicated ps p v power supply for the dp ex the v ps l for the dp can t be shared the plug won t fit so you can t fry it and don t even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously on the other hand the teac rc f footswitch is sharable you ll need a mini plug to phone adaptor but i think it s indispensable if you re working alone speaking of power a strong plus for both recorders and for me a deal breaker were it not present is phantom mic power so you re not limited to the built in stereo condensers they re not bad for rough work but unlike mic stand mounted portables it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals i can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar acoustic or electric amp violin or percussion i want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics i like the resistance of the faders on the dp but i can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the dp ex there s no cd burner either on the smaller unit but with usb transfer capability that s not an issue for me having similar xlr phono and rca jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste i m not bothered by it because i have space to run the cables but it s worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you the led screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues the flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be especially since the menu is used so much a slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble i do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at degrees and doesn t interfere with jack access it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use tascam should consider a similar accessory the software is largely the same for both units aside from additional mastering tools essentially packaged presets and here lies my major criticism i feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality i e levels eq arming tracks with dedicated knobs and buttons and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what i see is an inflexible constraining menu system if there were some way to customize the menu navigation the equivalent of software hot keys it s possible the frequent repetition of non functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do the best evidence of an unbalanced design i see is the dedicated phantom power button on both units whose purpose is to display the phantom screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off that crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder when space for knobs and buttons is severely limited i can understand the design thinking and trade offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu but the dp ex is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi tracker a fostex x effectively doubled up the functionality of two tracks to cover four so i have to question whether the trade offs tascam made here in fact diminish the user experience with connectivity and software based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving i believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the dp ex will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience i think tascam would be well served taking that into account i ve always liked the design of tascam gear it just looks and feels well made and that s still in large part true of the dp ex but i can t help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old mk ii cassette track would satisfy a lot of people out there and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off
1192	mixed my band s album with these headphones the sound quality is impressive in all ranges and they have a very respectable bass response they re also great for drum practice as they block out the loudness of the drums so i can hear my metronome perfectly they re also awesome for live recording use as a monitor i will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future i use this when myon stage microphone inch gooseneck blackare too long for what i want to do sometimes on rare occasions i have used this to extend the length of the model the mic i mainly use this with is anady dm drum and instrument microphone which is small relatively light and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals when i am using that mic for alto and tenor sax i use anon stage my microphone extension attachment barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand and attach the gooseneck and dm without using a separate mic stand because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile i keep a few of each size around plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars in some situations they can be a savior during set up i will empahsize though that anything larger than the dm or dm which is slightly larger and heavier and this may not hold your mic in place love the on and off switch and the sound is great with little or no feedback would purchase this mic again this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from the pencil condenser are questionable they have picked up outside noise like birds etc but with a decent bit of white noise but i may have had them running a bit hot too the strange clamps have worked well for me
1193	i have multiple guitars for different styles i use these strings on my ovation legend for acoustic leads good tone good sustain and they stay in tune i play gigs a week on average and practice everyday these strings get a workout and i change strings when i start to lose sustain that s why i buy the packs so i always have spare sets on hand i have a bunch of instruments synths back up recordings plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording practice having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere it works fine it is lightweight and feels sturdy only drawback i tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass and the preamps saturated in low frequencies input has to be kept within a small range i have k k pickups in other guitars this is the first one i ve bought that had the smaller transducers it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers like other k k pickups it sounds darned good with a decent pa head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking the pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack this one comes with an ingenious diy installation jig made from i m not kidding cardboard golf tees and double sided tape it makes placement a snap the best pickup is still an external mic but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer you can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup these are fine but didn t fit well but they are a quality product in my case i actually needed medium or small to fit tight
1194	i like the product a lot for me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect it is not so long as i thought i though it would be like the piano s sustainer but it s a good pedal effect my guitar get a good sound with the attack effect thank you there s some element of nostalgia with the ds that i ve just never understood i know they re cheap i know they re incredibly durable as are all boss pedals i know everybody had one or tried one at some point and kurt cobain apparently used them with his fenders but i also know that i ve almost never been happy with the tone i get when i step on the pedal it s incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way i ve used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers you can mess with the tone and dist dials all you want but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals and even on amp distortion with a richer deeper tone coincidentally i also used the boss os overdrive distortion for many years which is supposedly merges blends a ds with an od that pedal isn t ideal either but if i turn the knob all the way to distortion it s a much better tone than i ever got out of a ds then again it is very dependable and usually only or less so i can t really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone s collection that just doesn t mean you ll want to use it all the time oh its a crybaby i have a crybaby wah you suck because you don t own a crybaby i m tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn t even tell you how many strings their instrument has this wah pedal just doesn t cut it maybe at one time but not today it hasn t been up to par in a long time as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal my mom bought me this one i thought it was awesome until i learned better it took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when i finally did i thought i broke it the eq on this pedal isn t good there is no smooth transition from heel to toe there is a big drop in the freq that kills the effect you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop you have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board i can t say its just a complete piece of junk it does give you a wah effect it is a classic pedal but there is better out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing i even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue i still had to slam on it to turn it on off and it still sounded like a cheap wah my suggestion the mark tremonti wah is great kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use it may cost more but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway so just go with the tremonti power wah to begin with what i use for wah is the digitech rp processor you may say that this is a cheap processor and it is but i ve been using it for years and i haven t seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters why i suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on i have mine set fairly light and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily you even have presets crybaby being one of them you can get an entire processor full of effects and an awesome wah for a little bit more if you want a cheap child s gimic type toy this is for you want to get serious about a wah spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere first of all don t expect any new tuner to work as a drop in replacement drop in replacements for tuners basically don t exist unless you have the exact type of tuner and in that case you aren t doing an upgrade you ll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer or if there s a guitar center or guitar shop nearby have a tech do the work for you these tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive with a nice vintage look they would look great on a either a strat or tele unfortunately my squier bullet had a slightly smaller headstock which meant that the low e string s tuner was too large the wing for the screw hung over the edge therefore i will not be installing these on my guitar but that is not the fault of the tuner functionally these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate and i ve heard the hold tune just fine check the back of your headstock for fit but if that s a go these are a great option i ve had this pedal for about five years i own a bunch of other overdrive pedals including the boss sd ts a klon clone and a bunch of diy pedals the bad monkey is cool for a couple of reasons first is the bass and treble controls most overdrive pedals only have one tone control the bad monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows second is the mixer out not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a speaker sim the gain sound is ok but what i do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive this pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state it s built like a tank can t go wrong for the price imo oh man am i glad i found this deal no more for strings anymore there the exact same as you would get from the store delivered through usps dont have to go anywhere how cool is that out of stars but of course its ernie ball the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals cheap mass produced housed in a plastic casing but the fab series offers affordable effects to at surprisingly good quality and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost times more if this pedal cost i might gripe about how tight together the input output v jacks are i might also complain about the weird position of the mix speed and depth controls on the top of the unit or the small footswitch but at this price for it to sound this good i can t complain at all don t expect the fab series to be good at everything but if there s and effect out there that you only use once in awhile especially anything involving modulation or delay the fab series is going to do it well and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals it s just a great option to have for casual budget guitarists i expected this to come with a dc adapter nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn t be any or i could have ordered one the product is good surprisingly loud the bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles once the battery popped out by itself when i played a low e but that s no issue i have only used it with a v battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain i hope that doesn t happen with an adapter it s a nice little amp good for carrying around if you have long fingers you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it s height it s that small a guitar strap a backpack and a ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it the distortion it gives is good not good for palm muting this is nice for practising randy rhoads the doors type of rock where not many effects are used also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring and inner many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one it s easy to change the polarity open the box of the adapter and exchange needs soldering obv the red and the black wire places i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband this product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the port the product specs does not show or say plug port my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one the support people at behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo sounds like bs to me the problem i had and the reason i bought this is that i tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a adapter chord it works but the levels are too low when i received this i was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are but not by much it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional i d say the level is beginner intro level sound and quality i bought a like new product describing faded or damaged packaging when it arrived the pkg box was dented i don t care and product looked new inside but all the instructions described a blue usb light and cd of driver and recording software which this did not come with behringer gave me a link to download i assure you it s crapware and beware for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use rock out so i recently purchased the visual sound one spot combo pack and i must say i am quite pleased i was checking out some of the higher end products t rex fuel tank voodoo lab pedal power and just didn t feel like forking over the money maybe one day if i m going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around i ll go for one of the other products but from what i read on the visual one power supply i was willing to take a risk especially for the great price currently i m powering hardwire pedals a dunlop wah pedal and the berhinger cs see i m cheap sometimes but effectively so so i m already using of the power supply cables all pedals are powered without issue without noise there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect whatsoever i can t say enough how excited i was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board i just put together and when it came through and worked flawlessly it was all the better i would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals or even a moderate or novice player it s simply a reliable and affordable way to power your pedal board thumbs up and stars rock on if you need a tube screamer you can t go wrong with the ts the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal it sounds amazing it just might not be your sound i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording they prefer it it s not better both are great i own over a dozen overdrive pedals i know that is just insane this is the best i have and the best i have ever heard i use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads it does a great job tons of tonal options if i were to buy one od pedal it would be this or a barber this bag is simple yet it s really thick so it makes you feel like your guitar is safe i have seen many gig bags rip tear or seen the straps rip off them but not with this baby its sturdy and cool with its design and pick designed zipper i didn t expect to be that cool not much to say about a chrome neckplate it s largely a cosmetic item but my old one with the serial number was corroding pretty bad and i liked the look of the new one a few people have mentioned that it s thinner but assuming you also have the pad underneath which you should that was not a problem for me at all anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws installation took all of minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before looks great i m a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play i however am having a ball playing as loud as i want with as much or as little gain as i feel like at the moment with my classic rock guitar headphone amp my rickenbacker sounds just the way i want with as much clarity or with all the smoke as i feel like dialing in for now it is so nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in put in my ear buds and practice for a while anywhere i want anytime i want downside i wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size vox amp and the controls are small hard to read but easy to learn you do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time solution hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive i plan to pick up other versions of the amplug from vox to extend my fun this was a good choice buy one this is pretty much the ideal tuner as far as i m concerned it s true bypass brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage accurate small footprint durable powers all your other pedals and is under especially if bought used its virtues are many and varied if you ve been using a cheap crappy tuner like i was you ll notice the difference all the more if you want a hyper accurate tuner for some kind of technical work the pitchblack s tolerances might not be quite what you re looking for but as far as stage tuners go it s got a tighter tolerance than the boss stompbox if you want a buffer in your chain this pedal won t supply it as it is true bypass if you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune this is not the pedal for you the output is muted while the tuner is engaged i prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune so for me this is a non issue plus i like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch these are the only circumstances i can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a pitchblack right this instant edit after some time with this pedal i ve noticed that when used to power other pedals some of them don t like being daisy chained from this pedal s power output most notably tremolos but when the daisy chain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the pitchblack is powered like any other pedal the problem vanishes kind of strange and i figured worth noting here but i don t consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less this pedal really hits the spot warm vintage analog slap back delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate which if you are a fan of johnny greenwood you will love i also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound with the modulation on and very short delay time sounds almost like a phaser after trying about every comp out there for years i came across this i have a wampler ego compressor too it is the same quality as the ego compressor better than the script reissue it was too noisey for me i have amps one of which is a good tube amp but with digital reverb it fails to sound right so i researched reverb pedals and found the biyang rv tri reverb to be the best in design tone and value on the market i was not wrong have had this unit for well over a month now and it still is amazing in how it produces just what was lacking with that one amp s pitiful excuse for reverb this device with it s three different reverb settings is just right for any style music you play the spring setting is really quite real in how it trails off and that doesn t happen in a digital device analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce the hall setting is wonderful rich but not too over powering the a b switch is kinda a nice touch much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer and the fact that it is stereo both in and out is just icing on the cake since it resides on my board i have grown to use it even with amps i have that are built with good reverb i m so acustom to the great sound of the biyang that i just use it for nearly every amp i own it s that good was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my year slept before i was plugging in headphones to my amp head but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up take out electric plug covers get all cords out of the cabinets etc oh how life changes with a baby this little product is the perfect solution it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package there are two on settings regular on and fx on regular on is basically like a standard lead channel turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch fx on turns on a little delay effect you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off there are also knobs for volume and tone plug your headphones into the side and you can also plug in an mp player on the top to jam with a backing track vox has samples for all of their amplugs on their website however they seem to be missing samples for the joe satriani version i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug i have a pair of middle lower range headphones audio technica ath m professional studio monitor closed back dynamic stereo headphones and the amplug sounds fantastic in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale b c of the js branding this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs however it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled personally at the higher msrp i dont think its worth it but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone the rogue analog delay is well constructed and feels very high quality given the price it s similar in size to an mxr stompbox though the knobs are more reminiscent of a boss delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entry level pedals i really have no complaints about the analog delay in terms of how it performs and sounds it does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about ms or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats it s just too bad that they weren t able to stretch out the delay time a little longer perhaps to ms or ms once you get into that territory there s a much broader array of things you can play including the u style phrasing repeats that being said a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway but it isn t fair to compare this pedal to an mxr carbon copy and if you re looking for something cheap and surprisingly high quality to provide ambiance the rogue will do just fine bucks is better than for the tube screamer from ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube i use this on the clean channel of my bugera v tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should awesome with my ltd vc with and jb pickups this pedal work although i find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup my issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough the m does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal even running the delay on the output side of the m the noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup i run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig when using fuzz and distortion i recently picked up the tc electronic mojomojo overdrive at a steal of a price but i m evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price i own many different overdrives including light overdrives in the tubescreamer and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous blues driver ocd joyo ultimate drive etc to me this is closer to the tubescreamer family as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive actually the separate knobs for bass and treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the digitech bad monkey build quality outstanding it has an mxr style click button press but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last the v jack is on the top out of the way of the i o jacks the battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw button that you can easily get open with your fingers or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver the thing is dense and build solid as a rock i always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush resistant and tend to get punted around by your cables finally the knobs are built will with some force feedback and several of them are actually notched to settle into the position which is a nice touch tone quality obviously the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review i would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a and absolutely loved it as several previous reviewers did but based on the pedals i have used and my experiences with the mojomojo it feels more like a to me the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy whether the mod switch is a boost or a cut the pedal is bassier in the up position don t get me wrong i definitely appreciate the abundance of low end frequencies but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through i could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments it does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character however if you d like a similar effect with a much more expressive and brighter output try the mad professor sweet honey overdrive or its clone companion the joyo sweet baby overdrive ease of use versatility many overdrives only have the single tone control so i was excited to see controls for bass and treble still i feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps and very muddy with others i will update my review if my feelings change as i have a few different combinations i want to try out i feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer i will say that it is one of the more tube like overdrives i have tried hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone attack them harder and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup much like a tube amp however if your hope is simply to plug into the mojomojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal great overdrive distortion for classic rock music good volume roll off tones at full bore it sounds like vh and some other s rock dudes it s quiet and has a very active tone control the crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic not too much but just enough mxr has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do i now own a script phase and a micro chorus as well and plan on getting others i m a classic rock player these pedals have a classic s vibe the joyo tremolo is awesome best for the buck it s just as good as any i love the joyo pedals affordable and doesn t break the bank i use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and it works perfectly very minimal buzz lllove it i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from there is no difference in the sound at all this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in a box it does s hair band and s metal very well if you re looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic plexi or brown sound get the joyo british it nails those sounds well i really liked this one i bought the crunch distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone i very much like how joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced boutique pedals i will continue to buy these products from joyo until i find something wrong with them and at present i have nothing to bitch about at all here sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound as an example this is the jf and jf on guitar and the jf on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a line spider buy this these pedals and all things from joyo they are worth every penny wow i am very surprised by this pedal i got it with the intention of going aft that chimey ac tone which it does a decent job at i didn t realize everything else this pedal can do you can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem metal no problem crystal clear and punchy no problem super crispy tele twang no problem i tried it on bass and was really impressed it is eerily similar in function to my sansamp vt bass pedal and gets a lovely svt type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end i even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added od crunch in front of both my head cab as well as vt bass and para driver works like a charm turn the voice control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy while adding a bit of mid range response i only wish this had a balanced xlr out in addition to the normal out phantom power would be nice then also i would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there i have been thinking of trying the joyo di wit speaker simulation for this purpose but i just haven t gotten around to buying it yet in my opinion you should at least check this thing out i mean its this is the greatest practice amp ever and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band first it s all tube so it sounds really good it s gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast second it s watts and is pretty darn loud i ve used it for band practice and it s definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer at a bar you ll probably need to mic it or use the included line out third if the speaker isn t loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the x and x cabs i have that ll make it loud enough for most bars fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything you ll need most small tube amps don t have built in effects so if you re trying to practice down in the living room you re forced to drag your effects with you that s annoying with this amp everything is built in fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet you can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone else sixth the price is amazing all tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow fender is basically giving these things away i love this amp so much i want to buy one for every guitarist i know the only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch but considering the price that s understandable there s no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them you ll only want the cover and footswitch if you re playing in a band the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals
1195	fender guitars are made for tinkering they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws at any given time i have a fender guitar taken apart and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws i inevitably lose don t get me wrong i am a die hard fenderista but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects not fine examples of the luthier s art that s what makes them so much fun to play and modify was upgrading the chrome on an mim perfect fit used switchcraft jack includes screws and washer for the jack looks great
1196	fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder one of two new models the other for acoustic guitars well built reliable folds up takes little room to care around ideal for gigs as well as studio and home solid performer michael haller captain soul s sound circus fender s new mini acoustic guitar stand is one of two new stands the other is for electric guitars sturdy reliable and easy to take on gigs or use in the studio or at home michael haller captain soul s sound circus it didnt hold as many i as thought it only holds but that didnt matter now i finaly have some where to put my picks so i dont lose them the pick holder also has a sticky thing at the bottom so you can stick it to your guitar or somthing this is not my first planet waves locking strap they have never failed though the selection of colors and widths are very very limited it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks but for me these work just fine highly recommended sticks are well organized and always in reach this is a must have item for drummers and the well organized it fits the set perfectly and is quite practical what s not to like beatles picks a super cool little tin rocks my world and back to the garden
1197	i have two of these stands the electric guitar bass version and the acoustic version back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case yes folded up it will fit in my tweed fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar i do always keep it in the included stand bag to ensure i don t scratch or bump it against my guitar great at this price too buy several i ve got three of these simply because they work and they re easy to carry from place to place and i insist on a stand for my guitar none of this leaning stuff what a great device this is the first quick change capo i ve owned i used to use those old stretchy things since i play at some jams it s important that i can change quickly and accurately move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune you know i love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps i own one of these in differing colors and textures for eack of my guitars i no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while i m playing that prevents a lot of damage not perfect but a solid stand prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do and the bottom part that holds the guitar isn t fixed so it s good and bad good because it ll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do sometimes it just swings around annoyingly while this hanger is not unattractive and is well built i could and will modify it to better suit my needs the design of the hanger causes the neck of the uke to stand off of the wall inches at the head and inches at the hanger itself and inches at the base of the body this is not an easy fix but it is doable
1198	excellent mic rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise does not have an on off switch which is a bit disappointing works great and doesn t cost an arm and a leg quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence great price too i buy this cable for my dj system and work great i used a lot of time with my karaoke very authentic sound reproduction simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear the threaded end is holed so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock you ll never get your arm in there far enough lolyou will need a nd drill bit to complete the install if you enjoy playing guitars then i think you will love this shubb s acoustic guitar deluxe capo it something nice to have around your house and work great thanks to all ukulele straps are a rare thing and i ve yet to find the perfect one this one gets close not all uke players use straps some do and some don t purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced however i have two acoustic electric ukes and they are heavier than the non electrified ones the purists use i ve found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing a preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar this neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less there is another device called a uke leash that also works well it ties onto the headstock i like this neotech better because even though the instrument isn t balanced perfectly it is balanced better than with the uke leash the uke leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the neotech simple sling this neotech simple sling soundhole clip strap works on my concert and tenor ukes equally well but i have to adjust it some when switching it between the two the wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument i don t know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached this strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments you have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument the clip on the neotech sling is wider than most i ve seen and this extra width reduces but does not completely eliminate that risk the wider clip spreads the stress out i ve seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and i m afraid to try them on a ukulele i like this one with the wide clip and will keep it the uke leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place so i like this neotech soundhole clip device better the only thing i don t like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap but once on it is great you look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can t do it with a hat on it gets easier the more you do it i d buy the neotech simple sling again i recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don t want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on
1199	i needed a new strap but i didn t want to pay for one i saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot i m glad i did the strap is awesome it s very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap i ve ever had it totally deserves stars i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best i doesn t take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time this is the best one out there bar none really this is a keeper wish it came in different neon colors as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage that would make this one the best i love dunlop straps because i m a tall guy and they re long enough for me not to look like an electric guitar playing mariachi this will make your fretboard smile it takes a dry faded fretboard and makes it look like new a few dabs goes a long way so this ounce bottle should last you a long time if your fretboard is really dry faded apply heavily and allow it soak in continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry i was amazed at how this made a dull faded year old fender fretboard came back to life this is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on amazon the strap feels sturdy and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy definitely glad i bought this i have a martin hd with the large grover tuners this string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly if you change your strings regularly this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tuners for these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time i received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping it looks great the price is right but most of all it works wonderful very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case first i ve noticed that many reviews here are for the original ns tuner the one with only two buttons and coin slot battery cover this one is a little smaller has a metronome flasher and the battery installs differently but the name model evidently didn t change i compared this new one the original and the latest snark on dreadnought guitar mandolin and string banjo pros size size and size reasonably accuratemounting clip better than beforegood pricemetronome flasher maybe for some cons display not as bright as otherscontrary to their description this one seems less sensitive than original battery compartment difficult to openmay not fit well on some headstocks on my wife s a style mandolin it fits but barely on my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits that being said i haven t found anything i can t use it on my take the snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy lock in speed and visibility however i really dislike the eyeball on a stick form factor and refuse to use it on stage i like the fact that the ns is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument i even in leave em on in the case the display and lock in speed of the original ns was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me i ll keep the new ns tuners for now and hope that d adarrio or someone improves on it with a better processor and led well without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes usually in the lower octaves are a little off with cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised this tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes the fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars highly recommended and it looks great too a bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses an inexpensive way to find your favorite pick
1200	this cable is really good for the price i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet would like to purchase another one in the future buy it it s worth it i picked up another one of these for a new guitar and i m very impressed they ve upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one i purchased a few years ago excellent stand jf again omfg the mk type sounds take awhile to get so tweak consider your amp settings guitar type etc the other pedals like it in the series i m intrigued by but i can get any sound i want so far with my stuff i tried both the joyo jf ultimate drive ocd clone pedals individually on strats an lp a harrington through my slightly modded vc webber speakers tube amp clean channel as with any pedal it won t make you a better player only practicing gear research use and your hands touch grip whatever you kids call it these days will have the final say of what comes out of the amp i intentionally got the jf after reading positive reviews all over the net the jf was a curiosity purchase i was able to dial in sounds of anthrax stryper stratty buddy guy blues remember he uses a metal finger tip clip at times works with pickboy metal picks the dad friendly radio rock sounds of nickelback daughtry foo fighters to get your marshall sounds takes a bit of work but i use their blues breaker ii reissue reflector and sometimes the crushing jackhammer a bbii with more options and gain i also use a digitech valve hardwire for vintage s rock or switched to saturation and mid scooped for the pantera sounds so in closing this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a boogieish sound if you know what you re doing for the sound your leaning to
1201	a very good strap mine came flattened in a little box i wasn t happy that its form was deformed well in a few days it popped back into shape so i didn t have to ship it back a good sign i am using it for both some music and computer stuff the bag is well made considering its price you cannot even get a backpack for this price i love its depth a number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded this is a solid depth and cozy padding around it for protection be sure to check out all the dimensions though its very long i was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it i think i saw micro and thought shorter not only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack i m thinking of getting another because of this the only minus is that i wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder paper slot but these are just wish list items finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited lucky this is a good option i clip this pick holder to my music stand and it s always handy and very easy to use i use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder this is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on amazon the strap feels sturdy and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy definitely glad i bought this in fact i don t think this hosa gtr r cord lasted hours one step on the cord and it came apart this purchase is the very reason why i m looking to buy a wireless system maybe if you re using this to run a pa i would recommend it but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn t recommend this item but to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer you ll end up saving money over the long haul i love the freedom the g gives me i m a real klutz with my cords especially on the ml designed guitars so i figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun the sound is a lot more there between this the bill lawrence humbuckers that the sound is unforgiving and those mistakes will come through real clear making you work on your technique and become a better player i took off a star because i don t like the prospect of being a slave to duracell i am hoping that rechargeable batteries will be good enough for my needs and i ll give it stars side note the foot cord they provide was junk for me i suggest ordering some better ones like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa i also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to mark everything that comes into contact with the floor so needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my dean from hell i had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar hoping that they would all arrive at the same time so i was unaware at how heavy the dean was this one looked sturdy enough and it would be if it were an acoustic or lightweight hollowbody electric but the fact that i had to bend out the pegs just a smidge so the end knobs won t chew up the neck when trying to access store the guitar had me doubting the longterm durability of this product don t need to come home months from now find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room it should hold up long enough for me to order the hercules once i get the hercules i ll be using this mount for my rock band guitar controller
1202	i bought the hell babe years ago it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since the same one i have never had a major problem with it the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal its no crybaby and im glad it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn t no matter how much i tweaked it i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more especially since it has the auto off and spring back it really makes my solos rip buy it you will have a ball my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever finally a product that is as simple to use as a point and shoot camera literally i opened the box put in two batteries the memory card read the quick start guide put the zoom on the included stand and got out my mandolin and started recording the sound quality is great and you can play it back directly on the zoom by plugging in some head buds included the control buttons operate like a dvd remote with a menu button using the fast forward and reverse to scroll through entries and the record button as the set for someone who is not well versed in audio terminology gain sampling rates mics pre post amps levels whatever i just set it to medium gain watched to make sure the lines don t go too far up and was recording away in two steps push record to test the gain level and push record again red light stays on to record and push record to stop the file is saved and then you can push play pause to listen back deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a vcr you can use this puppy it is also handy portable and easy to take places i will take it to record jam sessions music lessons and practice to evaluate my playing and instrument comparisons the sound quality is great and i could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is i wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise finger slide noise and other assorted twangs and twings it records both in wav huge files and mp compressed with various quality levels to choose from you can easily connect it to a computer windows mac with the included usb cable the only thing missing is a remote since you have to push the button on the recorder you have to move to it to activate deactivate it also picks up noise from your movements but for the price it s a real gem i always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise doesn t cost a lot and delights the customer on this one it is the included wind sock a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording cool this makes changing strings of breeze i was using a hand winder for many years unit takes four aa batteries but is very powerful also has a lock on it so it won t accidentally be put into a drawer and engaged looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered easy to use i can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background this is definitely more accurate than a person s ear while other instruments are playing
1203	i got pink cause nobody would steal it and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great by far the best distortion pedal out there no doubt about that several of my friends use this pedal and they all love it i also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal it s great for medal it have a nice punch to it along with a great cut so you re palm mutes don t blend into each other like other pedals there are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations amazing i got this to power my danelectro honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy it s a power adaptor so it isn t too exciting but it works fine this tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding but it is not very good at parties it cannot compete with the noise level that people in conversation can make it is cheap so you should just get one i am having great fun experimenting around with different settings instruments and power feed voltage levels see the danelectro power supply for this thing really cool this unit is like a old blue jeans problaly exist betters pedals but it s produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything
1204	i got of these to plug xlr cables into the jacks on my board i got it because my board only has channels with xlr inputs none of them work perhaps i got the wrong thing basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion i have big hands which may be part of it it holds a mic just fine i just wish it had a little more give to it still a great product for the price this is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of people it produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you don t want to be too loud it has a headphone jack also i like this so much i might experiment with miking it for gigs never thought i would say that about a watt fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one there is an overdrive on off button with adjustable gain volume control and a simple treble bass equalizer other then that it is all rock physically it is built strong too for the money i doubt you can beat these microphones i just needed something for occasional outdoor shows and didn t want to spend a ton of money so far so good i will say that the first shipment had a bad mic but amazon replaced it for free and paid for re shipping so i am happy about that
1205	i didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted vintage for my relic d build clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on amazon but no worries amazon sells adapters to make the large holes in the neck fit the smaller vintage tuning key posts star off for not looking like the higest quality i m happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price definitely recommend these over any other string trees i used both one for dg and be required some minor drilling so i had a guitar tech do it for me just to be safe its poorly made with attention to detail i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon but they will not screw down all the way and are losse it is useless other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine i guess they are just screws but they seem to be good quality worth a little extra for the fender quality i suppose not much to screw up good quality parts on an essential product brain dead simple install and no surprises works like a champ i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas i had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger i took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards not forwards by hand slowly until it was perfect i also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case i slipped took me about hours the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance really close but they were terrible in operation i have no problems spending the on these to improve the guitar haven t played them yet but all the reviews were good so here goes update played for a couple hours first thing i notice is that they are geared lower than the old chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars you tune it a full turn and the tune moves up slightly which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment this fixed the chibson tuning issue i ll order another set for my other chibson also i have two epiphones i believe these are nicer than the epi s so i bought based solely on the reviews here i wasn t disappointed in fact i am pretty impressed good replacement for iffy tuners they worked for me i just cant get enough sustain out of the high e for my taste tried them on epi lp and a prs i m no eric clapton and i dont use amp heads nor do i employ guys to work on my guitars but thats my impression just not enough umph looks and fits great on my start nothing more i can ask for my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before i replaced it with this one i had the red snark and a couple others this one is the best ive tried so far no problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning stars if they had it that high what really can you say about switchcraft they just make good solid parts grab one drop it in and replace that old broken import jack
1206	not a great mic but if you need something realitively cheap it ll do limited dynamic range but it works wish i d have gotten something a little nicer though wasn t expecting much for this price but i was surprised have been using mine now for about months with no problems workmanship seems good does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product i also have a more expensive capo just like this one they look as though they come from the same factory more expensive is not always better i ve purchased many of these cables and i ll be getting more eventually cables even good ones eventually break these are quite flexible seem durable and are by a brand name if you need cables these work great i have my string on this stand when i m taking a break from practicing as you know a case is where you should store your guitars not on a stand it is easy to assemble you ll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one if you re gigging i might suggest a higher priced stand but for occasional travel and home use this will do the trick it is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music i really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you
1207	these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time there are several types of practice amps high end modlers line g dec vox vt that can still run and are typically overloaded with features the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v peavey valveking etc these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality and then there are the micros i always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas boy was i wrong i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear he s not a big kid so even lb amps are pushing it plus a gig bag and school back pack that was initially what brought me to the micro not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso turns out this is an amazing amp the tone destroys the line and the features crush the vox pathfinder watt or bug v and the fender frontman not even in the ballpark each of the models are distinct the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate obviously this isn t a loud amp but that s not all bad you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes it also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously for example i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy don t let the size fool you i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i couldn t have been more wrong there are several big websites and it s tough to find any negatives about this amp quality sounding and durable for a great price oh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too absolutely no complaints about these cables we use them to power two fender squier strats and were very happy with the sound quality for our use the plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides covers and provide good strain relief for the price there s no worry about solder quality since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable we also use the more expensive metal cover hosa cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp specs mono tip as title says high action inadequate loudness for pickingi compared this to the mitchell md and think the mitchell is very good for it s price you can compare both at guitar center many years ago i had a fender stratocaster and i had to get rid of it so now i have the closest that i will ever get to that guitar again this one sounds great and looks good and the price is great as well i picked up a couple of these straps one for a les paul and one for a bass anyone who s ever played a les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a must have this one fits the bill the end pieces are thick with a peg hole that just fits not so small you have to cut and not so large you re worried about the guitar slipping out the cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable it doesn t scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesn t grab your shirt so badly can t complain good strap at a good price
1208	i bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect then i re ordered and i got what i think was an acoustic type because they were the same mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold so i just ended up with two dozen wasted picks so just make sure you get the right one update okay so i just realized that there are dunlop stubby picks and then there are dunlop big stubby picks sorry i have been using the exps for some time now on electic acoustics and they have become my go to string i find the coating to be less noticeable than on el rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set to set highly recommended it s kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of mostly positive reviews already but i can t help it i like this guitar quite simply this is a really nice guitar is it nice no but for less than nice doesn t even describe it my jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing the outside box had a little damage but the guitar was well protected inside so no problem since i d read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish one of the first things i did was check it out thoroughly nope no flaws noticeable to me kind of a satin laid back finish that feels good and looks nice oh but i did immediately remove the pick guard it just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and in my opinion it looks better without it other reviews had complained about a too low action but mine seems dead on of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule but even so there s really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low some mentioned rusty strings not on mine the strings looked fine and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well and of course the guitar sounds good again maybe not good but at least good and certainly better than i expected it to sound at that price so if you want a nice sounding decent looking inexpensive guitar you ve found it stop wasting time just click the buy it button for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep if you are prone to losing your guitar picks this is a good set of picks to have around all in your choice of a single color per pack the quality is a bit better than the cheap fishbowl picks at the music store but not as good as my favorite picks dunlop big stubby picks mm i m a huge fan of the two previous ns capos from planet waves what does this add to the others well functionally i think it works no better than the previous dual action capo in other words it s freakin perfect so i d give it stars except it gets because that little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius full marks you can t miss with this product i m always looking for the perfect electric guitar strings as is evidenced by my drawer full of spare string sets that i felt failed me for one reason or another a set of these came my way as i had just gotten a fender jaguar i did what i always do when i get a new guitar i restring it even though the strings were practically new i could immediatly tell the difference in both feel sound the sound was crisper than the super slinkys that were on it they felt good to my fingers the only reason i took them off was because the jag was for surf music i wanted heavier gauge so i put these on my tele which was a match made in heaven they sounded great but most telling is that after a month or so of heavy usage they still sound great reasonable price great sound long lasting to me thats a perfect combo highly recommended
1209	i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing and it seems to have made my fingertips slick so i have a hard time holding on to picks when i use them on upstrokes i m sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem but it s more fun to blame the pick these picks were no different from picks without the gator grip imho but gorilla snot worked beautifully i play guitar i bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago they re very interesting these are soft rubber with a little bit of give so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies similar to using your thumb but not exactly i still pull one of these out every once in awhile in certain applications getting a particular sound for a song say these could be exactly what you re looking for overall these are well made and the ones i bought will probably last me forever but these would never work for me as a main pick i m glad i tried them though as i have nothing else remotely like them i used to use the martin tube thing that you stick between the strings but it was a bit of a pain you had to soak it then drain it then wipe it even then i worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar this is much easier and the guitar sounds great highly recommended i ordered this capo on a thursday and received it in the mail the following tuesday i had never used a capo of this design so i was a little skiptical but i figured with the price i might as well give it a try this thing works great there is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar the spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board i have only used kyser capos in the past but this one works just as well only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to otherwise you ll get some rattling noise from the strings once you get the hang of placing it where you need it it works very fast when you need to change keys
1210	these are nice and this was easily the best price around these are made in japan and i believe they re made for fender by gotoh so they re good quality but i was annoyed that they the bushings didn t fit the standard vintage sized holes in my all parts neck they re a little large so be aware of that i have used d addario for a number of years i m not hot about their acoustic but electric they re a whole new world i like these nickel on my tele they give them that extra twang i put this pickguard in a mim white blonde stratocaster and guitar looks so great i didn t need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar i got the aged white i was changing out pups for a more vintage sound this kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one i have a mim strat every thing went together with out any issues best price online and the shipping was super fast i back plate is the mint green but looks awesome on the guitar i got two sets of these tunners my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now i love them i ordered this after i saw one on a squier bass at a local shop the plate looks great on my mim fender telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the fender f plate i see on other guitars i used the screws and it was an easy install other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate the plate has five screw holes but doesn t look bad using this is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my mim telecaster
1211	i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed the cable itself is a bit rubbery and not slinky like some of the higher grade microphone cables but so far they have held up fine the cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier i already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well it was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where i need it holds zoom recorder as well with no issues when i am recording this works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod i bought pcs of these at each shipped these are very well constructed and function very well too i am using these to tap the inserts from my mixer and send the signal to my m audio fast track ultra for recording by putting the ts partially in to the insert of my mixer and most mixers you can get a direct output without actually interupting the signal chain the other end of the ts cable goes to the pdc and then i use the xlr output to connect to my fast track using either and xlr to xlr or and xlr to trs cable my fast track did not like something about the signal level when i fed it directly from the mixer but with the pdc between the mixer and ftu it works fantastic this is for refernce recording in our jam space not studio recording it works great for this application i have also used this as a di box for guitar all of my gear is middle of the line not junk but not super high end i don t notice any tone sucking in my jam space application i would definately buy more eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion worked perfectly out of the box and has been used several times to record choirs and piano the sound is clear and well balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around feet i started doing quite a bit of voiceover work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk after attaching it to a microphone stand i found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the yeti microphone this seemed like the best option for that upon installing the mount i had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you unfortunately if your microphone stand is coming from the sides you have to take the inner ring out rotate it to where you want it and reattach the rubber bands easy enough as i completed this is one minute after using it for a while the isolation is good but not great i think the bands are a little tight for this microphone i see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder this probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount it needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings i have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bands going to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a difference it s does its job it just could do it better with softer bands
1212	if you play rock or classic rock have a tube amp with a inch speaker that needs a little more life pop one of these in my little vht special came alive with this speaker love it works like a champ i only have four pedals on it thus far but i haven te had any problems no noise issue no brown outs because the power supply couldn t handle the load i still have open leads for those other pedals smile my power strip now has more space for other toys to make my weak playing sound better does a good job for a basic delay good for rockabilly and s slap echo i needed it for nothing else so i m happy i have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers including a few of the vox valvetronix series however this is both my first fender amp as well as my first true tube amp first some clarification is needed on tube vs modeling amp the fender super champ x is absolutely a tube amp it has one ax and two v s and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages however the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone which is what allows it to project different voices contrary to what some posters have written channel does also have some front end modeling except that the the model is fixed for blackface tone and controlled by a separate volume know no gain control channel offers different voice presets and of these model a variety of vintage fender amplifiers including the tweed deluxe bassman deluxe princeton and twin settings model a variety of other popular amps including the vox ac and marshall overall i found the available tones to be excellent unlike my valvetronix where i more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times i could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars one thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently you may have to adjust volume gain bass and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp however i found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component also the x does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or hissing you hear with digital modeling amps the tones that come out of the speaker of the super champ x are very rich and touch responsive as you d expect from a tube amp the amp has tons of high end sparkle but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume true of many amps the stock speaker which is fender s own design and has a ceramic magnet i believe is frequently criticized as a weak point however it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps or only intend on playing at bedroom levels you re unlikely to take issue with it the eminence ragin cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end but again the amp is plenty loud and full sounding for its size better intended for home studio use than most gigs but it excels at what it does that brings us to the effects section and the fender fuse software that works with the amp via usb cable frankly i m not a fan of most on board effects with combo amplifiers i prefer to use pedals for modulation delay and some overdrive distortion the good new is that the on board reverbs which include spring room hall and a few others if you install them from the software are quite good you can also reassign the presets to different effects so if you want a flanger with a reverb you can have a setting for that if you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb you can do that too the tap tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects but as i said while they represent a good value for players that don t want to invest in pedals i m more likely to use my boss dd than the on board delay and so on the build quality of the super champ x is largely excellent the grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of fender s more expensive amps the amp weighs in at pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top one thing i did note however is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting so i will have to be careful about that also there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better but overall the amp looks very well constructed i was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic but everything is mapped to vintage looking knobs and from a few feet back the amp looks just as much at home in the s as it does post overall i think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that i hope to enjoy for years to come i m only really scratching the surface of its potential but it makes great fender tone sound easy the fender fuse software could be a little more intuitive to work with and i wish there were a better way to know what each of the voice and f x settings correspond to without consulting a chart but it s a great little amplifier that s all the power you d need for hobbyists and studio recording and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well this looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price to record you simply press the button and the led will turn red continue playing when done simply tap again and the led goes to green and plays back at any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish no need to line it up with the loop it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop if you don t like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub want to stop and clear two presses and press and hold and your back to a clean slate i don t know the limit of overdubs but i haven t reached it the amount of time for the looping i believe is min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content the tone preservation is excellent and haven t noticed any issues there you can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it if i have something i like i then output it to sonar to play with some more pros small very easy to use level knob and a stomp button designed by guitarists and it shows true bypass and plenty of room for recording cons you may consider lack of battery a con i don t everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through ac no drum track or click track but then again the aim for this device was to keep is simple i believe update i was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself i contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken replace at the store which i did it worked great then one night again i couldn t hear myself recording i played for about an hour with different configurations it seems not all v ac adapters are equal out of the i have it only liked when i used that adapter it seemed to work just fine so beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the v ac adapter
1213	works a little better at winding strings than the bare bones winders the string cutter is very handy the pin puller as is usually the case is a little clumsy to use but it works i purchased these to use with my mandolin they are ok i personally prefer a little stiffer pick but my kids have been using them with their uke s so all in all not a bad purchase solidly built small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag there isn t really much in the way of instructions but the leds are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out put these on my new la patrie motif and could not be happier the tension is just right for soft finger style manouche jazz sleepy d jango i have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar as that s what i learned on as a child i can t afford it at the moment so i decided to give these a shot these do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination i didn t expect them to but a guy can dream can t he anyway what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly bright takamine it also helped with the rather high action they play and sound softer it s almost like having a new guitar during the stringing stretching process i broke the g string go easy they are silk after all and so had to use a standard bronze replacement i asked my non music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the oddball string and she got it right on the first try that s how much of a difference these strings make they sound less metallic that may sound obvious but my point is that it s a big difference enough for her untrained ears to hear i m still saving up for a classical but i really love these strings and will be using them on my tak going forward i ve been playing for over years and now have three different electronic tuners so i m a good judge of the snark pros it s chromatic so it s good for every tuning job no need to plug it into your jack ambient noise doesn t affect it great sharp colorful display reacts quickly small enough to fit easily in my case cool blue color built in metronome powers down automatically to save the battery transposes up to four steps if you re using a capo will even identify major chords cons works better on acoustics and semi hollows than on solid bodied guitars made me realize that three of my strings need intonating or is that a pro metronome is visual only manual says that long term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars finishes big blue thing on your guitar looks weird now that i have the snark i have officially retired my other two tuners this is easier to use easier to carry around you don t have to unplug from your amp it works on acoustic or electric and it s chromatic and it s cheap definitely recommended
1214	these work much better than standard stamped trees no problem with ernie ball strings going out of tune quickly i did notice in guitar center some of those spendy american strats have the cheap stamped out trees and non locking tuners i purchased this for my love of playing guitar i like blues style and classic rock this watt amp will get the job done it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew so i had no bass control arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging you just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings this amp is rated watts so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a watt into ohm i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen i d recommend it but don t buy it if your looking for a really decent tone it s just a practice amp been using this brand of strings since i ve always been pleased i like the super slinks as well love um this inexpensive capo works as advertised it s the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup this has a nice smell and is good for maintaining the wood on the neck of your guitar best used when replacing strings so you can apply while the strings are off nice f logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat installed easy and the screws and everything were correct i would recommend this fender springs you ll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole there s too much tension to do it with your fingers my american special strat came with springs and now has the five i find it stays in tune like a instrument should now
1215	the m is well built sturdy and well balanced enough that i have no concerns about tipping even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music the tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort once in place it stays there with no slipping for all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car this is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives and i always have some concern that it will not be what i want when i get it in this case it is a winner delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed i have had this stand for over years and still like it s compact transport capability since i purchased mine several other musicians have purchased the same stand it is well built and can handle heavy music binders without tipping i ve used it at both inside and outside gigs without any problems as good as advertized rugged and sturdy live up to expectations and is comfortable i would definitely buy a few more of these
1216	these have been my favorite pick for years now but i must say that they are not real pointy and i have recently been trying some pointier pick and i m now on the fence this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts pedal my hat s off to behringer for doing an excellent job of recreating the classic sound in an affordable package i don t own the ts but i do own a ts and while the ts does offer a nice gritty overdrive overdrive that has enough bite to bring your tone out in a mix the ts offers a warmth and a sweetness that i ve simply fallen in love with several of the classic tubescreamer characteristics are audibly present slightly rolled off bass and a bit of a mid range hump with a tone control that offers useable tone at any setting i usually max out the level knob and adjust the drive know to taste which never exceeds o clock i ve found that this setting gives my tone the most body and depth i use this pedal primarily with my jet city jca h head just to pump it up a little bit this combination takes me straight into guns n roses or that type of s s era rock territory used over a clean tone the ts offers a very warm smooth bluesy overdrive that can either be more of a clean boost or add some grit depending on where you set the drive knob the pedal is made of plastic and while it seems solid enough it s the only area where this pedal really merits any criticism but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for it s clear that in order for behringer to offer such great tone at such a low price sacrifices in build quality had to be made that being said i don t feel concerned at all that this pedal will suddenly break on me don t be too rough with it and it should last a good while i use this stand for a smaller watt fender amp i don t think i would recommend it for larger amplifiers especially since it sits a little high but for my amp it s perfect nevertheless i also don t really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much so i can t imagine it being ideal for portability if you have a music studio and are doing more recording and or rehearsing than playing gigs this is a really nice stand i think this is my fifth behringer pedal admittedly i haven t had the time to try this one out but based on my others i d say this will do everything the pedals that cost double or more can do this mic is good considering the price does it sound exactly like a no do it have a decent quality sound absolutely if you re expecting an sm then buy an sm if you want something close on a budget this is your mic great value and good sound
1217	if you re like me you probably bought this to hook up an xlr microphone to a digital recorder or a pc it works fine for the handy type recorders but forget hooking this directly to a pc way too much noise had this for about years now it works great and for dollars it was a heck of a bargain the construction is ok it s plastic with a metal rubber bottom but seems sturdy battery is easy to get in and out and comes with one but is not shipped connected to the terminals signal wise if on it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static which raises the noise floor by a hair the noise isn t noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss works great in front for a clean or unclean boost but i tend to use it in the fx loop where it does what it s supposed to do i think it s a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup especially if the amp s eq isn t doing it for you or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal this thing fixes it all i would definitely choose this over more expensive eqs but i tend to take good care of my stuff i ve tried to like this pedal i really have maybe it s my signal chain my experience with the digitech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar sure the od is there but it isn t worth losing your tone is it again i reiterate maybe it s just me i have been messing around with signal chains for almost decades now and the blue pedal isn t any different either imo grunge was ok but not my kind of style once you setup your pedalboard that s it you aren t going to move stretch or step on these cables so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue they do however allow you to make the most use of the space on yourpedalboard packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require good plenty of gain on hand lots of sustain this thing can get really loud it gives yourinexpensive tube amp that marshall crunch built well it s casing is made out of metal not plastic inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing times as much if you re lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal forget the boss ds andget this one well worth the money bad adds a little noise hiss specially to single coils strats teles you might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise quieter with humbuckers but hums when i use it with my xotic ep booster whichi always keep on it doesn t happen when i boost my overdrives ocd hardwire cm if you move farther away from your amp the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise i guess this is typical for distortion boxes no need to boost it though it already has that thick big sound to start with it didn t come with a v battery as shipped not a big deal cause i use a poweradapter anyway this is my favorite pedal and i have a ton lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal great bluesy tones sweet and warm when the drive is down mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up like a cranked tube amp if you play the blues this is your pedal i m sold i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals
1218	the best buy for your bass drum this is a great cymbal stand sturdy tight well made using it with a crash and does not move or rattle amazingly well constructed stand for the price going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these great product i am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all but it is a great stand for my studio practice kit being honest don t know how it would be for a gigging drummer but for what i am using it for more than does the job wow haha this china really packs a punch haha i got this china and was blown away by it my band loves it the crowds love it and most importantly it is very loud and trashy great for hardcore drummers great accessary for yamaha keyboards fits and works well very adequate construction should last for many hours of playing at home or out wuhan makes great products for the money i have the medium crash and so i decided to try the both are great cymbals for the buck if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the s or s nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it the is a bit warmer than the the sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the bought wuhans the ride and a splash will review each one as they come in from amazon why the stars well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close if your on a budget like i am go for wuhans i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years this is a really good product and excellent crash wuhan really impresses me there are some great video s of wuhans on you tube you should really check those out before buying wuhans or any cymbal for that matter i am very pleased with this crash this mixer has four mic inputs it has some fun effects this mixer comes with a hz filter and a band equalizer on the mic channels it has a fx send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono i do not hear any external noise it has a durable metalic case this mixer has great audio this is a excellent snare wire used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old pearl snare drum quick and easy to replace came with straps to secure but did not use them as i prefer string improved the snare sound by no more rattle snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound well made product that did the trick product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect great product at a excellent price this is my favorite acoustic guitar stand it s easy to use on stage it can be used with only one hand and it has a low profile that doesn t take up a lot of space when folded and it doesn t stick out as an eyesore on stage i use this thing constantly and can wholeheartedly recommend it i just received this mic today and tried it out i purchased it after rave reviews from other amazon purchasers this is a heavy solid high quality mic are you kidding me at this low price they giving it away heck the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and it s worth all by itself i recorded a song today with it and i sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping you can t beat this deal awesome nice mic nice presentation although the harmonicas are plastic they look and sounds great also the price is great so go ahead buy it and have fun this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows smooth midrange and crisp highs for almost any singer or announcer this will be just what they need the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production the sound is unbelievable especially at this price for under twenty dollars this pyle pro mike can t be beat one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam dr portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device the tascam d is known for this noise issue but usually not when using the xlr input these headphones get the job done i like the build and design very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs
1219	i started using kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since i now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them they work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children i teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times great capos you won t be disappointed i m using this footswitch to control a drum machine it does the job and i ve had no problems with it it functions as designed it saves time when restringing a guitar it s made pretty well for a plastic tool definitely takes less space than a wire cutter and a cordless drill to change strings admittedly the cordless drill would be used mostly by luthiers but you get the point i played with light acoustic strings for a long time i tried these and they make for much easier action do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings i ll probably stick with extra light for awhile they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers this stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up allows you to get close to the mic and still play an instrument like say a guitar can be used either sitting or standing recommend highly be sure to get a pop screen for your mic and recording needs to improve recording quality
1220	i bought these to put on my really old martin acoustic the guitar still sounds amazing and these strings certainly fit my budget and provide a great sound my favorite picks can t go wrong with tortex the only habit i have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so i have to buy like a ton of them these are stylish and fit perfectly on my guitar they are even and not warped like the stock ones were i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound i change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit i can go to weeks for hard playing i started using fender strings with the stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat they sounded great i use these for my telecaster in factory spec and they are real nice too i do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets i have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period stick to nickel and you will be glad you did in my opinion d addario is the standard by which all other strings are measured i keep trying different brands from the cheap to the boutique and i always keep coming back to d addario extremely versatile stable and they last as long as can be reasonably expected of any non coated string the tuner is great seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back doesn t hold it at an angle that i find very usable otherwise a fine product that i expect to last for years korg makes great tuners i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen i d replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy i know i m gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins i may even have to drill the tuner holes also look forward to getting those crappy loose un smooth original hardware tuners off this thing july just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat didn t have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them and very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch i made a center punch mark just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft on each indent that the tuner made set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than minutes nice strap i meant its just a basic strap so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far should last a while with good care i recently purchased a epiphone eb bass and it didn t come with a case bag so when i found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try it is very thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine all in all it s an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don t want much padding
1221	nice tone very easy to grip last me a long time one of my favorite picks i ve tried for electric don t enjoy them as much on acoustic it didn t seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless it may work well with dunlop picks but not for theplanet waves standard guitar picks duralin blue gt medium heavy also the thicker the pick the fewer it will hold it has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot i ve found it mostly not useful thus far maybe it would help more when playing live so i can grab for a pick and know they will be there i bought my son a thousand dollar epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for christmas i told him an expensive one was not in our budget we went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one the sound was absolutely fabulous much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one the store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well in my opinion this was as good as other brands costing three times as much i m not sure how takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money but if you re looking for a starter guitar or just looking to add another guitar to your collection this would make an excellent choice i inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price we also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs thejasmine by takamine s acoustic guitar natural these are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price i love the flat low profile right angle plugs my only complaint is i needed some in varying lengths like and so i had to order the planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard i m never playing another guitar without these locks after my custom telecaster fell the neck went out of wack i had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again that s every musician s nightmare i immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps schaller kept coming up i looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use one issue you may run into is the nut running loose that s not a problem with the scaller locks it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is a drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily this clip does the same thing that the hercules guitar stands do lock your guitar in place so you don t have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger the auto close function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime didn t purchase this pedal from amazon but wanted to write a review i wasn t expecting much from this pedal but it is quite good is it a completely authentic acoustic sound i d have to say not exactly but it s kind of close and it s a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master which still sounds distinctly electric so far the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the jumbo setting again don t expect to sound completely acoustic it s a nice way to at least approach that sound check out some youtube tests before buying it s okay on my blues jr nos but really shines on my crate td which is a brighter amp and less colored i zero the spring verb and use the pedal s onboard reverb for best results used it with my strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a duncan hotrod set sounds good with both guitars especially neck and center positions pedal is solid be advised that it comes with the volt from the factory so if you use a dc power source then you ll want to remove the battery to do so you ll see a black knob at the base of the pedal just unscrew it pop the hood and remove the battery overally solid pedal as you d expect from boss a word of warning not sure if it s my setup but when the ac is in my effects chain not a loop but in front of the blues jr i started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning burnt tube or the like when i run it alone to my crate i haven t experienced this could be any number of things in my effects chain so check if others experience this i m wondering if a small cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp not sure how a non piezo pickup would affect the tone anyone know about this good grippy picks for some types of playing i go back and forth between these and the jazz iiis when i m in a jazz pick kind of mood i e when i m not using ginormous gypsy jazz picks or fender heavies i especially dig davas all models for acoustic playing and strumming nice tone as well have tried pretty much every dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing one thing about davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip and i ll pick the string with the rubber hand angle can also play a part in this probably just me i have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly what i love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path and have some nice touches in the way they are made one of those nice touches is a strain relief at both ends which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can and will introduce noise and static eventually the plugs are also of the highest quality they mate perfectly with receptacles on guitars and amps i mentioned that these are for inside playing what i mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface that is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is made otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality price and performance get one as a spare if for no other reason because i think you will be pleased with it nice quality plug i used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals works great and no noise the shielding on these planet waves cables are great i have some neurological problems with my picking hand and can t seem to hold onto picks i really like these max grips a lot and have found that they are excellent for soloing great tone as well for my tastes they are are a bit stiff for strumming but perfect for everything else i love the size and wouldn t want anything larger the advantage of these over the dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip you can still pick with them the davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side i would say the davas are slightly more flexible literally not figuratively i use the dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic as i ve been on an electric fixation lately also a fan of the regular jazz iiis and find they don t slip as much as my dunlop tortex picks i think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering still in terms of grip they don t hold a candle to the max grips both picks have their own unique tonal character i ve tried a variety of picks and i think that once you get used to smaller picks you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward these jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics they are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy overall these are my picks of choice for my style which is blues oriented surprised there are so few reviews edit the strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle it s getting easier with these i have also since found that while these are fantastic picks i actually prefer thedunlop jazz iii pick pack red nylon mmdespite lack of the max grip raised lettering they are just the most wonderful picks i ve used i do plan to try out some mm picks however as i suspect i m going to prefer a thicker pick the iii nylons feels slightly thicker than the max grips which i believe is why i prefer them i thought this was the coolest guitar gadget i use it often but find it is not very accurate i use my iphone app guitar toolkit tuner and that works much better if you tune with the snark then guitar toolkit you can see the difference no matter how many times i hard reset my gs no success there is no problem with my jack and the phone is in pristine condition no problems until now there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work but that s about it i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box i tested the irig with an iphone and was able to get it operating i am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend s iphone but for my purposes with a gs it is a brick if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation i will re rate the product
1222	i bought it years ago here at amazon and i couldn t be happier this was my first electric and after over a year of owning it i got a way more expensive fender strat and i still prefer how this epiphone feels it is really lightweight a lot more that even other les pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars i have tried this makes it very easy to play it stays in tune and it looks really really lovely i like it so much that i decided to add a pair of slash s alnico iis on it that cost more than the guitar itself this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain good ol crunchy bluessy rock call me cheap if you want and i wouldn t care this is one of those items that makes you wonder how come there s others way more overpriced and just don t find a way to justify that a real gibson les paul will sound better it wasn t until recently after years i estimate somewhere around hours of heavy use that it started fretting and that s why i gave it only stars but what would you expect from a guitar i m sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet tone machine it has always been if you re learning looking for a first electric or just want a practice axe that will not dissapoint you just go ahead and buy it don t give it a nd thought and do it holy guacamole you guys this amp i was terrified at first because i plugged in and turned on and had no sound took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase then decided to try once more fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and we have lift off so rocking i actually got this for my acoustic electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it i keep the volume low and the door open about to get a clean ish tone haven t cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but i m sure it ll sound awesome too i m so glad i was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago it s cheap yet works better than most tuners that require a plug in that end up costing around slightly more it s been awhile since i ve had it and still have no complaints or issues with it i wholeheartedly recommend this i purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn t work whereas this does the job i m happy i purchased this and didn t have to invest in purchasing v batteries every time i wanted to play guitar
1223	the dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required i bought this for an accousic guitar then i had to have one for a mandolin and now i also have one for a square neck dobro some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don t leave much room for a leather strap some case manufacturers have the same problem this item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job same with the mandolin if you want a wider strap the dobro had the issue with the strap didn t have a great connector i have a rose gold plated flute and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating this does the job perfectly wipes off fingerprints smudges easily and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate is easy on the plating and very gentle washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries am very pleased i use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and it works perfectly very minimal buzz lllove it
1224	i was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly but it seems to have no affect at all super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain but just take it off when recording very handy to have two picks with you at all times it s great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitar s finish me likey price can t be beat either man ya ll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it s all good and stuff man because like when you be spittin some sik leerix and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me ay yo let s go if you re a bass player and use a pick you need one of these if you are a bass player and sometimes use a pick you really need one of these i bought one for every bass and a spare wedgies work better on bass than guitar because the strings are thicker and usually parallel i have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings but the bass ones stay put really these things are great did a ton of research out there b i bought this i can t believe that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal what a racket it is if i could make one i would this one was cheap and does the job dunzos the construction of this set is superb the ends have heavy duty strain reliefs and the xlr connectors are well made and perfectly mate with receptacles on the devices being patched probably the biggest plus is the cable itself which appears to be heavy gauge certainly thicker than my other patch sets and built to last in addition i love the attention to detail in the form of color coding which makes tracing cables behind the rack a lot easier i have patch cables from different brands and this set does stand out for its quality when compared to the others and the price is so close to the more generic ones that i have been using that i am switching over to this brand for my future needs works with myon stage ks classic double x keyboard standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by on stage as wellon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackworks as advertised you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it the cable came in the time it was promised it worked immediately upon installing it on my yamaha keyboard to my windows computer my music program had no problem detecting it and using it i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer i am very happy with how it performs in both situations high quality solid support and good design decisions all around the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to i will try to add pictures when i get a chance this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also i share most of the same sentiments the pads are a little stiff but this works does the job and is such a small package fit s in my macbook bag
1225	i have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man the neotech is by far superior to anything else i have hooked up to my gibson ess the straps are easy to hook and unhook i have two sets on my banjo one set for the neo and another for the harness i use when the back needs a rest it s easy to uphook one and hook the other well done and i like the bounce feature softens out the jolts i ve been using national medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke decided to try the dunlop overall i m very pleased with this pick previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums this is true but isn t a complete description basically the national picks are much more elongated so while the nail to thumb pad distance is about the same on both the across nail distance is much greater on the national picks i actually find the dunlop pick to fit much better and i don t get extra overhang as with the national which tends to catch the string bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding and to have the padded area longer i first used the snark when i borrowed a friends before a show and i thought it was the coolest thing in the world he used it to tune his acoustic electric and at first i thought it was working off of sound but then i put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric and it picked it up instantly and tuned it perfectly i couldn t beleive it i had to have one i ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning and vibration tuning as well has having the tap beat metronome and i am in love with it it s so sensitive and so accurate you can turn the mic off and use it to tune your electric guitar in a very loud room and it won t pick up ambient noises love it love it love it i recommend this to all musicians the mic feature would be useful on your music stand or attached to your trumpet tuba saxophone whatever clamp it on and play absolutely awesome
1226	i play guitar and keyboard and sometimes i need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards i would not do that without this straplok received a new w hartke x bass combo at church tube pre and ss power amp the preamplifier has one ax it was an eh it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube he would not send a warranty replacement my suggestion new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like doug s tubes tube depot eurotubes or some other reputable tube vendor i don t trust ebay tubes and won t spend the hard earned cash on nos replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue i m primarily a guitarist but i keep an inexpensive sx bass around for when i m self recording and whatnot since it isn t my primary instrument and i don t play bass live well not yet it never made sense to invest in a bass amp i bought this to liven up the tone when recording in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface it does the job makes the sound warmer and more amp like honestly if you ve been doing some homework about this thing you should know what to think of it behringer s build quality can be dubious sometimes but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn t a picky audiophile this box is no exception i ve never personally played through a sansamp but i would hazard a guess that if you know that s what you want this won t satisfy you if you want something like a sansamp you could do a lot worse than venture the some bucks on this little box to my ears it sounds quite good get it if it fills a need for you and you re broke knocked off a star for behringer s usual build quality although mine hasn t broken from gentle use yet i bought this tube to test in a friends fender hrd in the pi spot he wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain he liked the result when i switched out the gt ax i want to try a jan at next but the jj is doing a good job for now also interested in swapping out his gt sovtek s for jj l gc s bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp and i think they improved the sound over the original eh ones these are considered boutique tubes but i think they re popular for a reason
1227	this is exactly what i was hoping for the string cutter works better than expected it s nice not having to go hunt down diagonal pliers when it s string changing time the only little issue is that it s a little tougher to spin really fast than the little string winders because of the grip no biggie though the strings on my new yamaha fg s were too hard and noisy so i ordered these and what a difference in the feel playing went from painful to pure pleasure i did notice that the tone of the low e string was a bit dead especially in drop d tuning so i put that one yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows for that i gave four stars instead of five
1228	it s simple basic but i don t think it does that good of a job this is because it doesn t really humidify that much and doesn t extend very far into the guitar i like purple and it is purple the strap is sturdy it works what else needs to be said it arrived timely is decent quality and a nice color this product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar my fretboard hasn t been cleaned oiled in years so it was extremely dry the cleaner removed visible grime the polish cloth shined up the frets but most importantly the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel i am very pleased with the product d arrario does sell some fine strings while these are not my very very favorites strictly because i prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings they still do just fine much better than some other brands i ve tried i would not hesitate to buy them again good sounding and playing all around strings purchased for my epiphone electric guitar perfect has a separate area for my sheet music picks and capo nice bag i really like it all i wanted was a simple tuner that s what this is if you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect pros works fast accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale cons built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped also tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room fyi snark makes more complex tuners which are actually cheaper on amazon that also have or extra features
1229	this is my second makala gig bag the first was a smaller size for my mk c concert uke the second was the one above that i purchased for my oscar schmidt tenor ou my ou actually came with an o s logo d gig bag included but while i love the uke the bag was pa thetic single layer of fabric providing no protection after comparing that bag to the one for my makala uke i came straight to this page and ordered another makala bag why do i like this bag better its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside you can carry it around set it down let it roll around the back seat of your car a little without blemish to your instrument as good as a hard case of course not but very good for a bag i also like the fact that there s no logo on the outside i can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke i want inside that was a disappointment for another reviewer for me it s a plus what don t i like the dorky pad around the handle both my concert tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it it s not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle and it just looks better without it i use this for my uke my string acoustic a parlor guitar and my trusty taylor easy to use very accurate highly recommended i love this uke it came fast such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy sounds amazing intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it i m a seasoned player of almost years i have owed a dollar martin soprano uke which i had to sell in a time of need for rent money i ve been sad ever since i m in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play i just got this uke today now aesthetically this uke isn t as pleasing as say a martin sorpano but it sounds amazing for the price nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too i have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation this ukes sound is at least as good as a dollar uke seriously impressed i see they make a mahogany version i think du which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone i may get one in the future its only bucks on here amazing anyway this uke is bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated too i see some people complaining about the strings and how it goes out of tune fast when i got my martin soprano which wasn t cheap it did the same thing best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long time anyway this diamond head du soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists excellent would recommend this brand to anyone very happy with it considering the price point i d buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you don t need a hard case great for the knock around uke though
1230	the beta a along with the original sm are industry standards that s well known as a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go to house mics in fact i noticed betas all over the place at a small theater with a high end system that i played at just recently i had used the old for years before moving to the beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two the beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll off to avoid that boomy muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close you definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected built like a tank is probably a bit overused when describing products but shure s vocal mics truly earn that title they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc no problem when you are maintaining a bunch of music gear it s nice to have tools that you never worry about for that reason i d highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal chances are its in working order no matter what i replaced the factory strings on mydean playmate avalanche junior solid body electric guitar metallic silver sizeand what a difference in sound these strings seriously rock i also use d addario strings on my ukulele and i ve had great luck with those they withstand a lot of play and i don t have to replace them often the best part is the sound is so much brighter and louder definitely recommended working great on my stratocaster excellent purchase feels good to switch positions solid and quiet i should ve bought this to replace the original switch from the start ordered and out of i have exactly zero flat washers doesn t match the picture caps are marked k so looking that up they are uf pot lockwasher nut and cap are what is included it is lighter than most fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy speakers the material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging times a week for the money they are great look nice are very easy to install you will like them on the guitar i have an axe fx that requires quality monitoring i do use studio monitors but sometimes i need something that no one else can hear and for a while was using the senheiser hd pro headphones when i put these on without burning them in i was blown away at the difference for more these cans are more than worth the extra cashalso better is the leather wrapped around the arc much sturdier while the pad on my senheisers is flaking off piece by piece these are as described these work with fender switches which turns out they include those screws and fender pickups used them while building a few pre wired pick guards
1231	it s good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price good quality cable actually much better than i expected for the price i don t move around much so i don t know about how rugged it would be out on the road but the cable is flexible and should stand up to a lot of rolling and unrolling you will want this to save your battery s when there is no power around not much more to say good luck i purchased one of these a few weeks back and loved it so much that i just had to order another one if you want comfort styple at a good price i highly recommend these guitar straps this is a great microphone it s light sensitive and looks professional i used this alongside my xonar dg sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted db i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording bought this sn snark tuner after i bought a ukulele snark for my little niece i was so pleased at the ease of its use i mainly wanted this for my banjo but i also now use it on my baritone ukulele a guitar and if i ever get into the spirit i might just try it on the old mandolin that my great aunt left me the snark is small very light weight and super easy to use it s a very worthwhile purchase well i found the lesson very good and worth the money i payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great a friend gives his time to help kids learn music he mentioned the need for one so got it it appeared to be built well and i ve not heard any complaints about the performance not very helpful sorry just love them came really quick love all the different colors and thicknesses in all the colors you can fined a fine med or heavy
1232	sure there are fancier tremolo pedals out there but i ve always been a fan of the boss tr it s got a more mellow and vintage fender tremolo output and suits my playing to a t pair this beauty up with an electro harmonix cathedral reverb pedal and get lost for days definitely worth the reasonable cost this is a great effect awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should no need for the evh red logo version unless you re a super fan or something i actually believe this unit will exceed all your expectations ships fast highly recommended
1233	i don t know if this is a common problem but i have these on both of my basses and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing like metal does before it rusts it is literally only one of the arms out of i have so i think it was just a random thing the problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn t just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose and one time the first time i didn t notice and it actually fell out notice i still like the product this was just one of those things i think so i would still recommend it works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made but other than that works as intended love it nice mic to record acoustical instruments more words word word word word word word word word word word i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer i am very happy with how it performs in both situations high quality solid support and good design decisions all around the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to i will try to add pictures when i get a chance this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also
1234	as a pro musician i am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations i had a bad experience with a few compression pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet give up on the thought when i upgraded my pedal board i decided to give the idea of adding a compression unit to give my g l american legacy stratocaster style guitar more sustain at lower volumes boss is the company that dominates my effects board i rely on their chormatic tuner digital delay of them line switch direct box almost every night for gig practice with a somewhat negative attitude going into this i had a great surprise to find that i really really like this unit it did what i wanted then some great tone sustain oozes from this little box stays in the on position for most of the time i am playing my electric guitars especially any stratocaster styled guitar i own quality is there in construction and signal passing we never have problems with our monster gold cables conversely we have other cables crap out on us periodically they are and look the right size and fit the cover well a must when you want the right screw for the job thanks none of the problems on off that plague the cry baby better sound too people are sold on that because of its association with hendrix but this is the original and the best obligatory my experience with this little tuner has been perfect it s extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment it s dead quiet when activated easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you re tuning takes up very little room on a pedal board the cream on the coffee is that it s under a hundred bucks that s crazy for the build quality it s a little iron bricki highly recommend this little guy korg got it right on this one comes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple they are cheap when bought in the pack and they are very quiet i need to order a couple more packs though this power supply is unbelieveble versatile when i first saw this i believed it was only for pedals but it turns out it can power up a lot pedals better than any power supply out there this power up my pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more im buying more and it will work only with this thats why i say this is the best on the world
1235	i got a couple of these only buy this cable if there is no chance that it will be ever used in the real world after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug and of course since this cord is molded sealed up tight it can t be repaired you could cut off the plug and solder a good inch plug on it but why bother just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord this cord is too flimsy its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing but inside its junk thrown away money buy a lottery scratch off instead i have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me this little device changed that by allowing me to use just about any standard strap and attaching it to the neck for better balance and its inexpensive has a nice smell works like a charm this bottle will probably last me years good cheap price a recommended purchase no complaints at all i use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a pod studio ux have had tons of compliments on the sound people can t belive its a dollar mic when i tell them such a fantastic price on this can t beat it just got this in this week looks nice and works as intended for bucks can t really go wrong i use this with a behringer c and have had no trouble getting it to fit it s a bit snug but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit this is a great microphone it s light sensitive and looks professional i used this alongside my xonar dg sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted db i would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording i ordered this primarily for my string ovation bass first there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings my ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but i was finally got it on the bottom between the d g string tuners it does not respond well to an open b but octaves are fine and as long as i have confidence in my intonation it is no problem i tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on when i tried it on my ibanz solid body string i found it to be even less likely to read quickly or at all also worked great on my strings i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon this thing is awesome it s so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it oh and it turns itself off after seconds of no sound it does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark but the more i use it the better feel i get for it if you don t have one get one throw this right in my little storage bag i use for my gigging materials microphones cables straps tuner etc folds up easy fits great seems stable enough
1236	i ve only been playing ukulele for about years so i m new to using a capo it seems to hold tight it s a button it s not fancy it s silver it screwed into my ukulele with no problem and it works very well i bought this to go with my epiphone ukulele for both myself and my grandson it s a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp for the price it s good it is a nice strap it takes care of business just fine i wish i could have found a more colorful style but all i could find on line was black but it s a very good strap i love this tuner i feel its more accurate that the old one i have that was given to me i will always buy snark tuners they are very sensitive so i feel that my instrument is in truer tune the ukulele is very cool looking it plays nice it doesn t sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele it comes with cheap strings but it s a very fun ukulele i think it s worth a hundred dollars
1237	i got these because i hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than i absolutely have to at first i thought i may have made a mistake because the tone was all off super bright sounding on first installation played for a half hour and retuned sounded better played for another half hour and retuned sounded even better played for another few hours and they sound fantastic will update after i get a hundred hours on them about days from now will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn t hurt them yet very impressed these elixir nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings great product these extra light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead i buy elixir nanoweb strings in singles so i can select the gauges that i like even better a great product no matter what gauge string you choose these picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well look cool to i will buy more when the time comes i like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere i use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar the right angle is nice because it s low profile and fits perfectly on my board even when i put it in it s travel case everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem this cable is built to last overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly what more could you ask for this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs you can jam for hours with this thing it s awesome
1238	this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths price was good for a useful accessory great selection of dunlop picks it was a good choice of finding what type of picks i preferred didnt know until i sampled quiet a few yep it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar i have a washburn rover a backpacker style and so a stap is a necessity and this works just great
1239	this polish works well for what i need it for i am not a clean freak but i take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there i had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things needless to say the strings were at least years old and i was about to replace them with new ones but thought i would give this a try i am amazed at how good the strings feel now they really are like a new set of strings saved me bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves my only reason for knocking off star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be they could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done i ve owned a lot of cables over the years and most have been junk for the money there is no better instrument cable out there than the spectraflex i ve regularly rolled pound half stacks over them jumped up and down on them and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements and they stay clean and work like the first day pros proper shielding means this is a quiet accurate cable slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle very flexible metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen available in some very cool colors lifetime warrantycons none to speak of spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today a lifetime warranty means you ll have it forever if you play a string instrument this one is a must i have several and a snark for each one unfortunately in the span of about two years they ve gone from about in bulk to about double that it s a good product but shop around wisely for the best price and hint read the fine print if they include a battery you ll pay lots more i even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store five stars for performance take away one for greed and another comment in i decided to buy more but went to another source which only charged one shipping price not this tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that i can t plug into a tuner banjo guitar mandolin alternate tuning even has a metronome for timing practice great product great price
1240	i bought this to replace a recently busted generic volume pot it works like a champ i m a stickler for genuine oem parts so i typically by fender only pedal infaltable es muyy bueno tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay como solo boss lo sabe hacer i bought this usa fender product to replace an imported piece of junk imports often have threads other than inch sae it fit perfectly on the jack socket threads quick install works like a dream
1241	probably the best kapo out on the market very high quality and a sleek look easy to use what more could you want i played with light acoustic strings for a long time i tried these and they make for much easier action do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings i ll probably stick with extra light for awhile they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers this package of picks is of good colors and good weight they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff it is an excellent backup capo i don t feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings the snark sn is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate i beg to differ this is the most accurate headstock tuner that i have ever used and it also has a built in metronome which i never use but could come in handy another thing is the price point which is simply amazing the blue color is a bit annoying however and i d like it if they came out with a black sn the visibility of the screen is amazing and i can see it even with the sun reflecting off of it or in a completely dark room
1242	i do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos and after using this filter the pop that occurs with p s and b s in the voice are basically gone it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances i m not going to gush over this one it simply works well for the price paid it has nice thick leather ends that hold onto my guitar well enough especially if you use locking clips you do use them right i like it and will use it again i use this as a microphone preamp with an akg perception microphone there are ins and outs balanced unbalanced on each channel i am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position i run this direct to my digital recorder i get a good clean sound on my vocals still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit the unit is channels has rack mounts and is sturdy not sure on the tube yet new to the behringer product line but so far i like it and will explore its potential stars for price quality features amazon i recently bought these for my home studio so far so good keyboards to mixer they are a little flimsy but so far no problems have extras if necessary high end cables also break down they were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus for the price and selection and results works for me these are high quality thick guitar picks the colors are great unfortunately i would have expected a little better packaging i know the company is trying to save money but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive almost didn t know what it was because of this just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail
1243	the e bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar great tool great ukulele very light which is nice intonation is spot on looks beautiful too a perfect soprano ukulele for a beginner or an experienced player looking for a nicelooking affordable ukulele i ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church it was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews i found it to be excellent for the price and so far have had no problems with the zippers this product is described as a soprano ukulele gig bag and that is exactly what it is a gig bag is not a rigid faa approved flight case nor is it a semi rigid polystyrene case with soft covering reviewers that don t believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a gig bag and don t understand the term you wouldn t put your reading glasses in a soft padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you i don t know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag but i found that it fits the soprano size perfectly it is very well padded for a gig bag having extra padding at the base of the instrument where the bottom strap button would be if you have one to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end it also has a nicely padded handle i received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well ukulele not included they cost a little more than this beautifully finished everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable nice sound in the acoustic too if this is an indicator of indonesian made instruments then all string instruments should be made there epiphone has outdone itself i absolutely adore this instrument i would love to have a baritone uku of this same design got a new tenor uke and couldn t resist putting my fav strings on it replaced ghs strings so far so good i m a seasoned player of almost years i have owed a dollar martin soprano uke which i had to sell in a time of need for rent money i ve been sad ever since i m in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play i just got this uke today now aesthetically this uke isn t as pleasing as say a martin sorpano but it sounds amazing for the price nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too i have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation this ukes sound is at least as good as a dollar uke seriously impressed i see they make a mahogany version i think du which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone i may get one in the future its only bucks on here amazing anyway this uke is bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated too i see some people complaining about the strings and how it goes out of tune fast when i got my martin soprano which wasn t cheap it did the same thing best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long time anyway this diamond head du soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists excellent would recommend this brand to anyone great little tuner very accurate and portable nice bright screen perfect and the price is right its nice it has a chromatic tuner on it too as wellas guitar and bass too very handy i useit to tune my baritone concert and soprano ukes
1244	got this stand to mount a studio projects c condenser mic the stand is very stable and works well it is very reasonably priced as well i got the irig thinking i d use it for performance but he app leaves somthing to be desired i had a very hard time fining a tone i could live with plus once you add any of the virtual pedals the feedback was rediculous arrived promptly nicely packaged holding my instruments securely i ll likely order more and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts this holder is rigid well built rugged and works great at what it does holding my ipad i play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app metronome and other apps and having this hold my ipad so i can adjust it and see it clearly where i want it is nice great product highly recommend
1245	quick snap on and off sturdy if it is not convenient it won t be used in this case it is very convenient and easy to use hence your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident well worth the money spent im sure these strings are fine i like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my jackson rose these however or the high e the jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it because with a jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings i was left with worthless strings my mistake just not for one of my electrics my mistake but i do love the other strings they offer so im out four bucks oh well this amp is awesome its great just like it s advertised i play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the fender fuse software fender fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire the amp itself has presets as advertised are shown in different colors red green orange and you can totally customize the presets so if you want different distortions go for it another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials learn how to use it record some music but you can t save them bummer i know but it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings one last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal about the fender mustang can only use the button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses buttons or up can only be use by fender mustangs up remember this i was really interested in the m and checked with the fender forum and i found that there is a problem with the m you can go to the fender forum and read about it under the mustang amp section to make the long story short some not all m m m s have what is decribed as a fizz on the clean setting when hitting the low e string sometimes it s noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible some people think it s the power supply but nobody knows for sure apparently fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a fizz problem there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz like i said i just want people to know about this before buying a m now i am considering the m which also has the fizz problem but with the the software fix released from fender there is no fizz in the m i don t know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because i didn t get the m but if i bought it i would give it a rating of stars because i don t like this fizz on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me if it didn t have this fizz i would give it a star rating as the title it works the way it s supposed to but i wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it won t move easily nevertheless it s a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground just remember use some common sense don t expect the guitar to totally stable i use this item for my daughter size guitar its looks light in weight and firm and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars
1246	alright strings nothing too spectacular about them i m a fan of beefier lows and thinner highs but at the end of the day they re still slinks i like them but i love the schaller locks more they don t feel as secure as the schaller locks sorry i bought a set of these to upgrade my kona k etrd a vast improvement over the old ones now it stays in tune better and they re very smooth looks nice too it s a great strap it s comfortable and you can wear it for hours it looks good as while i got it earlier then expected and i love it i would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro i am a fan of joyo i own the vintage od the ultimate drive the sweet baby the us dream the crunchbox clone and this one this is probably my least favorite joyo pedal i m giving it stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap but the octive leaves much to be desired i have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue apparently one of the components is installed in a reversed positon which results in the lackluster octive i haven t taken mine apart for the fix but i read that it s just unsolder flip and resolder the same component you can google it for better instructions still this ain t bad for the pocket change they charge the reason i haven t fixed it yet is i have the feeling that once i mod it it will sound just like my dano french toast albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass
1247	i ve owned and used this product for some time now and am quite happy with it i did notice that i had problems with an unpleasant humming introduced one time when using it with powered speakers but i believe this was more so my fault than that of the unit i learned that my active speakers did not care for input cables past a certain length for greater distances using a wireless transmitter to deliver the mixed sound and its matching wireless receiver connected to the speaker units solved this problem completely the fx processor works flawlessly just as long as i remember to push down the selector to engage the desired function very easy to use compact in size no ability to instantly mute an input device other than to turn down the gain for the price what can you expect soon i will be in the market for an upgrade one that has slider controls and the ability to connect to my laptop via usb i need a few more xlr inputs and at least a band equalizer and compressor limiter for larger gigs and a fairly large choral group and its accompanying instruments just waiting for a good deal one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers well after starting to use it on windows x i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings i went to the behringer website i found the product page found a tab for drivers downloaded them and boom all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap drivers are absolutely required if you use windows i am using this with a behringer fx mixer it is a good combo the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough i treat my gear with care i figure it ll probably last for years and years and years i am extremely happy and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation this item was received well packed and on time provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks it is a nice cable for the money seams to be made well looks like it is holding up so far we use these on our wireless microphones and they have very vibrant color and easy for us to determine which microphone is associated with which volume dial on the amplifier
1248	these are great patch cables especially for the price they don t suck any tone they are reliable i ve had mine for years and are really great for players on a budget these fender medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well color and appearance is a personal thing i think these abalone picks just look cool the color mix is random no two picks are exactly the same some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them overall the effect is not bad compared to real abalone fender makes a nice standard pick the three weights are pretty easy to figure out light medium and heavy these mediums work well for playing electric guitar i have some light red ones that have a lot of flex those work well for acoustic i ve used dunlop with the little bumps for grip and the dava rubber coated picks they are all nice but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick the gray dunlop s don t look anywhere near as cool as these at for a dozen they re worth a try it they don t work out for playing they sure look darn nice the fender logo is in gold dava grip tipdunlop nylon standard picks grey mm not so pleased with the sound quality sorta disappointed with it over all but ya get what ya pay for so i ll keep it anyway the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great not so pleased with this the seller is fine no prob there its that this mic for my use is useless it records tooo low cant get enough volume from it
1249	this pedal is a must have for any pedal board i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best i got this for my boss loop station but it doesn t work very well i keep hoping i ll find something it does work well with a very good strap good product great price as long as you take care of them they seem as though they will last quite a while i choose this rating cause it is the best adapter i ve found i like that is doesn t heat up or even get warm although i only use it with my looper another plus is the length of the cord is the best cause i don t need to use and extension cord with it one less thing to set up carry around and worry about i truly recommend this one spot adapter to everyone this product isn t really one to review but it does what it advertises i use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my tu great tuner by the way starting to build my pedal board so i figured better to start off with a dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a t rex fuel tank which i m planing on in the future great adapter for all of your pedals decent quality and only ten bucks can t beat it these replace the oem tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock they look fine when i get the guitar back together i expect that they will work properly delivered on time as promised there is such a thing as too much you ll find it in this pedal i have both this and the boss distortion pedals and prefer the boss i use the us for short lead riffs it works great in a sweetening role it is easy to change the key manually in point of fact much easier than i originally thought it s a main stay on my pedal board now i ordered these because i wanted to deck the tremolo on my strats because i don t really use the trem i have a modern american standard and an american vintage reissue hot rod strat there are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as i can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black my standard now has black and silver springs but the hot rod has of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with easy to install and works like a charm this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm nothing that s why it s so inexpensive what you see in the picture is what you get but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge it was incredibly easy to install and the sustain is improved one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge the springs in the back keep it back the string tension keeps it balanced in the front what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back
1250	my th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks they are good and reasonably priced the principal is mad at me because i told them that a real drummer plays constantly so the walls in the halls cafeteria tables and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors and they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do which is why i replaced them i suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost well made works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic i cannot express how over sized this pedal is it s ridiculously big and it s unnecessary if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do again please be aware of the dimensions this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though though it does rob tone i am normally a guitarist in my band but i have found myself at times needing to play the keys also having two instruments to play a pedalboard and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage so this adapter made things much better for me when i find myself back in that position works great with my on stage keyboard stand if you play keys and are also a vocalist this is a must worth every penny
1251	they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so i purchased this key on a whim when it arrived the instructions were not clear but i sat the dial to loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning too loose and deep so i increased the setting to and repeated almost the sound i wanted so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern perfect i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest using the setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms octave apart next i worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side i used on the batter side and on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound i wanted the bass drum came next i set the batter side tension notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained this is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned set i ll never go back to tuning by ear you ll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and don t forget to write down your optimum settings i bought this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp it fits very well and sounds great we ve been using remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from classic rock to speed metal great quality very durable you can buy remo heads with your eyes closed i had a cannon brand clutch and i bought this one to replace it what i like about this one is how the release lever works on the cannon the lever was vertical this made actuating it a less natural motion with this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases that motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use an argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but i have had no issue with it aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well i ve been using the d addario strings for about years now us steel us made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings little known fact in the industry their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry after plus years of playing d addario rocks this is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work i would not use this mic for professional singing just spoken word i have many microphones and this compares to the range mics it came and it wasn t broken or bad and it held my brother s guitar for a few years until he sold it this brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing this is not a deep cleaning dust or dirt removal brush it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by last last pc power cleaner oz the brush is super simple to use with the album on your turntable hold it at roughly a ninety degree angle for about two revolutions and then sweep it off the lp no fuss no muss no fooling around never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers when there is visible dust on the fibers give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers after each use rotate the handle around to cover the fibers if you press the brush too hard against the album or do the deep dive sharp angle trick fibers will be broken off the brush just press lightly against the rotating lp sweep the brush off the lp and all will be wonderful with this brush this brush is sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest and thorens the brush comes with no instructions for use an odd omission maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use instructions would be redundant audiophile or not this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings i bought these to try them out i have used remo a little then i used to have some aquarian heads and wanted to try evans to see how they are amazing i practically beat the crap out of them and the held up my next acoustic drumset will have evans on them great price but very fragile i m a year radio pro always careful about my cables the end separated from the cable not very good quality would not buy this brand again shipped fast sounds great and the price was way better than a lot of other places that i know of
1252	best string capo i have ever used and that s over decades works easily and flawlessly very well made five stars this installed easily a nice feature is ability to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument when the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain i might have had with earlier straps a keeper for sure after going to various guitar music stores and trying out many guitars yamaha ibanez fender and others i researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make model and saw the many positive reviews it had i was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first so i purchased the best sounding guitar locally costing me after day i realized i was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online the many reviews were absolutely correct this guitar is wonderful and sounds great i replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the light strings i bought even though it is only an guitar i will treasure this one as if it was perfect intonation all the way up to the octave low action and stays in tune for days i always have problem finding pick when i need them and this product helps me solve the issue it is easy to use good strings i don t know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case this one surpassed my expectations months into using the gig bag and not a single problem the pockets are packed with books tools and strings the shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze i have been using those webbed nylon sometimes cutting straps for years cause they were inexpensive but not cheap don t know why i waited so long quality in this baby comfortable too the tabs broke off right out of the package the other reviews made me aware this may happen an easy fix with some super glue and for the price who cares if i have to fix it it is accurate and very easy to use other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money highly recommend
1253	i bought a rogue mandolin from a friend who bought from amazon but did not have time to even play it for only still brand new never played i have owned and played many other mandolins about a dozen this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills the mandolin is not playable in its brand new state not in tune action too high lower action will result in string buzzes and this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup i went thru all the necessary steps almost like a luthier would do and it came out sweet it now has very low action no string buzz very good intonation one can find info about mandolin setup on the web it s quite tedious work this will be my beater mandolin at nothing can beat it it stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re tune so this is more than adequate for daily practice often times it even stay in tune the next days i may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one the finish on this model has some blemish some small black spots on top the sunburst color but only if you look really close i would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred at less than no problem at all of course this mandolin is no match for more expensive models brands such as kentucky but i gave it a stars based on its high performance cost ratio if you don t know how to setup mandolin then be prepared to pay to for a professional setup which is a must otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge that s unfair all brand new mandolins require setup at this expense unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it if you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week i tested both of them they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said that s why i bought this and they are solidly built too not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine i don t expect to come with it so no cable is ok for me here is the but there is no on off switch this really pissed me off but this is my fault i should have read the star review first the photo shows no on off switch however this does not catch any attention and all seller seems to have trouble to say this product does not have this does not have that it only says what the product does have oh well i got stuck with two microphones without on off switch i can buy an adapter with on off switch for microphone i have a don pablo cuban guitar made in for a few months never change the strings and sounds great i put this strings and wao know sounds wonderful few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change try this are the best the warmth and the richness issue from this thing just the way i d hoped i could not be more pleased with this product it actually delivers much more sound than i expected like many others here have pointed out this is a very good leather strap at a very good price and it is made in canada it is a simple design but it is plenty long enough for a taller than average player is solidly made and did you notice how low the price is i have looked at leather straps for some time and could never pull the trigger on ordering one because of sticker shock on the price most straps i have seen in guitar stores of this quality start in the price category i just cannot justify spending or or more for an overpriced version of this same guitar strap which has some fancy brand name label on it and is of no better quality this strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap a nylon strap may work adequately but lacks any real sense of style also most of the name brand straps are two inch or three inch wide and this inch wide strap is just right for me i like this strap so much i am now placing an order for one in every colour i can find them in for use with my other guitars i love this wall hanging mount of course you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud or use drywall backing screws etc but that s just common sense the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described the arms are adjustable stay where you put them this fits my string fender jazz bass as well as my acoustic guitar violin and even holds the neck without touching the pegs if you want it to i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments this is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to
1254	pretty seems to work fine purchased a pack for my playing buddy he loves fender only way to go will order another set soon very happy with service i bought this guitar about years ago and i have played tons of different acoustic guitars from taylor to fender and more this is by far the nicest acoustic guitar i have played the action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well i love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars additionally this is my favorite guitar and i would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic this guitar could very easily pass as one of the dollar guitars the guitar has no finish which i prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands i love takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value this guitar will last forever because it was made so nice recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature i promise you won t be disappointed and i have been playing for years so i know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar thanks takamine this pedal is remarkable for useful tones the sound may not be for everyone but i already have a boogie for the really metal like distortion i needed something that was different but still usable and i feel this pedal fills the bill the low price tag didn t hurt my feelings either this is a win win buying decision as far as i am concerned it was suggested that i start with this product since i m learning and adding it to my repertoire of instruments comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding
1255	i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine there doesn t seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last they do what they re supposed to do so far the ones i have used have all threaded nicely into our u rack there are exactly as described and do the job what more can a guy say about a little box of screws maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be i run a randall g hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state i ve used or heard for recording i use a peavey and its so sweet tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard recently i started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that i felt like could only be achieved through a pedal there is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals i used the dod death metal for years when i first started playing however there is a downside go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old am radio if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least quality dist pedals are not budget friendly i chose the mt because i know boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using it gives a variety of sounds it can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones the controls make it very tweakable and i have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it read the included book look up some mp s over videos online and check out other guitarists settings it will help you tame this pedal into what you want perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot there are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful i ve seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz i must say learn how to shape sound spend time dialing it in to your rig within minutes i was pleased with the mt i used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick heavy distortion with a good response i say the mt is worth an investment if you re looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board i keep this cable on my pedal board pedaltrain mini with soft case i ve posted a photo on the pedaltrain mini page the right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp i use a mogami silent cable mogami platinum guitar straight to straight with quiet plug feet for the input to my guitar but i can t justify paying a lot more money for the side that goes to my amp it s not getting bumped around plugged and unplugged etc this cable works perfect for it s purpose oh yeah and it matches my tweed amp it s nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play a lot of songs say capo preferred it helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on i recommend this product not much to it does what it should holds a standard mic pivots in direction only not the best build quality in the world actually fairly thin plastic but for what else can you ask for should last a few months at least the pick holder work as described i have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece it is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick it works well for standard guitar picks and will hold or picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument these are good picks i ve tried all the other gel pick s and plastic pick s the gel pick s come close but these are great because i have dexterity problem s and the plastic rubber grip is perfect i do still have a little trouble with controlled the pick and droping the pick but they definitely do help i def do recommend these to anyone who was deceased bad dexterity this pick is great highly recommended i love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick grip is very good this is my new favorite rock pick i have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great escpecially for the money i would recommend this to anyone does a great job of checking cords was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash tests multiple types of cords also for the price i m really happy it s my first one i get and it s perfect i m learning how to use it and it s not as easy as you guys think i mix and master all my own music on these guys before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen i cant have giant krk monitors blasting in my small apartment but what i can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light these are not beats by dre they will not make all your songs have super bass and they aren t a great fashion statement however they are work horses and will show you how your music really sounds nicer headphones exist true but these are the best in their price range in my opinion this is an excellent strap this particular strap replaces a inch wide model that i ve had for at least years that is a great strap and has held up wonderfully i fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability so why the new strap by not using strap locks the area around the strap button holes is much looser than a new one would be since i recently bought a new guitar i wanted a more secure strap without going fully to strap locks so far so good wider i wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference boy does it ever the new strap is really much more comfortable than my old inch model it isn t a miracle but it definitely is noticeable with my lb les paul a consideration this is suede and will fuzz for the first little while if that is an issue for you i would avoid this suede strap and probably suede in general after these strap break in though they are very soft and supple highly recommended for confort and durability large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch the included velcro works well for me i haven t had any pedals fall off yet cioks psu fits underneath with a couple of modifications i m careful with my stuff so the soft case suits me fine i can sling it over my shoulder and carry guitar amp all at once plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag if you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though for many years i ve been playing with proel and fender cables until i start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency this guys put an end to the problem with high quality components best of all warranty for life or maybe longer i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments this on stage da drum stick holder works great and is super easy to attach looks good feels good don t know what else to write here to meet the review word count i like these short planet waves cables for short runs where there won t be a lot of abuse going on they have good quality connector jackets similar to monster cables there are better made cables out there but few are in this price range unless you know what you re doing these things are too small if you feel comfortable with your picking skills the size and stiffness along with the built in grip are pretty good these are for lead and not rhythm the picture won t show it but they are about the size of a dime the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles i just got one and have used it for a few days and it s the bomb i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over this product is a rubber disc with small arms in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface and you can set your instrument against it and voila it doesn t fall over here at home i use it on the second shelf of a bookcase and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove heel on carpet neck in guitar rest i m going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases because i can use them at one of my uke parties if one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor for instance to take a whizz they re just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them here i just find a spot near wherever i m sitting and it becomes my lean spot and i can even set my beer can on the round part on the back coaster uke guitar holder it s quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument i could carry a metal stand with me but it wouldn t fit in my ukulele case this planet waves product does a winner
1256	i now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my fender amp after i bought monster cable to hook up my pedal board i thought i would try another one and update my guitar i had been using a high end planet waves cable that i bought in the s once i found out the input jacks on the new monster cable didn t fit into the fender strat jack i was a little disappointed i didn t return it and as stated i use it for the output on the pedal board save your money i went back to my planet waves cable i payed back in the eighties for the planet waves which now comes in at around what i m getting at is you get what you pay for i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day but i haven t bought a guitar cable since this one plus years and still working planet waves wins the most diverse pedal i own you can play everything from pink floyd to parkway drive with just a few tweaks on the plus side it does the job powers your v pedals and doesn t break the bank on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy best to have a noise gate handy just in case this is super warm and can get very trippy i like the depth it adds to everything from subtle extreme and whatever else the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too nice extra milliseconds really is more than enough and i have a highend tape type unit that is something like seconds but for what this does more than enough i like retro and this is it i used this on a show the day i got it and it was noticed by all i have to say mxr has really stepped up their stuff very musical pedal again do your youtube homework and listen around and you ll come to your conclusion amazon is great to deal with tried several of pedaltrain in the past pt too bulky and pt jr a little to small this one holds my pedals perfectly simple light i love it this is the greatest practice amp ever and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band first it s all tube so it sounds really good it s gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast second it s watts and is pretty darn loud i ve used it for band practice and it s definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer at a bar you ll probably need to mic it or use the included line out third if the speaker isn t loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the x and x cabs i have that ll make it loud enough for most bars fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything you ll need most small tube amps don t have built in effects so if you re trying to practice down in the living room you re forced to drag your effects with you that s annoying with this amp everything is built in fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet you can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone else sixth the price is amazing all tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow fender is basically giving these things away i love this amp so much i want to buy one for every guitarist i know the only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch but considering the price that s understandable there s no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them you ll only want the cover and footswitch if you re playing in a band let me just start out by saying that i ve been playing guitar for over years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time i still own most of these units except for this one the joyo compressor my setup is a very simple one starting with a stratocaster to compressor wah wah super overdrive boost pedal delay then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb vibrato i don t want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i ve tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them this thing simply didn t work right out of the box while the outside of this stomp box is all metal the inside is full of very low grade parts from china loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board i ended up sending it back for a full refund i don t in anyway blame the seller they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again just nothing with the name joyo on it if you re only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware you get what you pay for
1257	other picks usually let me down when i riff and melt faces playing the blues jazz or gospel etc fender heavies are made to make the notes sound like l they have been hit for real i prefer no cheap imitations only fender heavies that s what i smoke very pleasantly surprised buy this one i like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put it looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well a nice strap for my lower tier guitars it works well i mean it doesn t crumble apart or anything i use a fender so its not as much of a worry but i have had one and seen other les pauls fall over sideways or get bumped into they then fall and break the headstock that s why i don t use them anymore this is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looper no complaints with this i have about different types of tuners and this is the best of them all i have small kids and birds around the house so many tuners get lost with the noise this one works off the vibration of the guitar so it is right every time even with a lot of noise around
1258	work very well nice low profile easy push button on and off but it is true not good for thick straps and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use i know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out but honestly this thing is worth every penny it cuts your changing time down drastically you don t really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller winder and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool not to mention it s very rigid and it certainly seems like it ll hold up for years to come it does everything it s supposed to do i got these for about here on amazon the dunlop or schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that i can see they lock securely don t require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar s hardware i have both dunlop and hennessy straplocks and i don t see any reason to pay more for the dunlops this is a nice little pedal it effectively quiets all my other pedals works as advertised not much else to say get one a good solid case as for size it s designed for the narrower fender style body electric guitars it could have better padding for instrument protection compared to similar product from other makes will do the job of good protection
1259	yes this pedal is plastic the switch is not the most durable feeling and the knob placement is annoying at less than you need to be able to look past these things i ve had a higher failure rate with the dunlop cry baby and that thing is built like a cinder block this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended which is to say this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going no overdrive pedal lives up to it s potential running into a solid state even modeling amplifier it s just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy some have complained about rf interference with the use of the fab pedals getting radio signals through your amp i have had that happen with pedals costing x the price of the fab particularly when running a long pedal chain based on tone alone this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under check out the youtube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by intheblues i believe he uses a drri with a strat and this pedal sounds great if you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of you may be surprised particularly if your other gear amp and guitar are halfway decent what i did note though was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other ts type pedals that doesn t make it worse or better just different the mid hump is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer which is a good thing imho there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers incidentally the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes since it isn t true bypass you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review i ve been playing guitar since and have used vintage dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced i am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear ymmv i like the sound of this pedal it gives my ss fender princeton chorus a good tubelike sound i have all tube amps but they are both heavy i prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs the to gives me the sound i like without breaking the bank i haven t used batteries in it because i use a spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard if you rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger you won t be sorry leeeeeeeeeet meeeeee saaaaaaay thiiiis iiiis nooooot liiiiiiiiike whaaaaaat iiiii thooooought wow almost like the opposite it is like a violin sound or mock reverse single delay sound gotta love the slow moe everest ez series shoulder rest for violin is very good deal if you are learning to play a violin it helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time i had an issue with my new squire guitar and fender hooked me up with a set of these the string ends have a cylindrical or bullet shaped end rather then the typical small loop the theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity i say they sound great and are worth trying i just order packs so i can have some on hand the us dream is supposed clone of the suhr riot and is the only one of the new model joyo pedals that i own this is a high gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a proco rat but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when i first pulled it out of the box and plugged in it sounded great but i wondered if it might be a little bright i was pleasantly surprised when i rolled back the tone knob to around o clock and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness at least with my setup les paul into a vox valvetronix watt this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full sounding power chords and singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals that have a fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack i was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices this is one of the first three i would recommend along with the outstanding ultimate drive and the warm sounding vintage overdrive however it s worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the new model joyo pedals which are notably lighter than those numbered jf and lower the weight is comparable to an mxr badass distortion except the switch and output jacks are more suspect still if a pedal sounds great and has yet to fail on me i refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me i think if you take care of it and use it reasonably it should last for awhile but if it doesn t being out is still better than being out i can bear it and dig it cause fuzzy wuzzy was a bear and it is green like the frog dig it i must have gotten a really good one cause mine sounds great and is nothing like those on you tube that sound so bad the only bad in mine is that what comes before behind and it is bad
1260	this is a nice strap it s kinda hard to get on the st time because it s stiff that turned out to be good good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat it would be sad if your axe fell in your soup the grip on these is pretty great i haven t dropped them at all and i ve been playing so much better they give a nice crisp sound with my elixir nanoweb strings it is okay it serves the purpose it is a good fit for the soprano uke a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place the case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case it will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty but will not provide much more protection than that
1261	these are good quality cables at an economical price the difference between hosa and my high end cables are barely noticeable the cable shipped fast and i couldn t be more pleased i thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big it really doesn t affect play at all so it doesn t matter works well and has good sound i really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds the interface could be easier to use but for this price point one can t really complain snark tuners are great they are very accurate and are very inexpensive i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case
1262	these elixir nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings great product these extra light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead i buy elixir nanoweb strings in singles so i can select the gauges that i like even better a great product no matter what gauge string you choose for the price they are awesome strings i like the sound i like a little heavier sound and i m hoping the high e will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge its always the first to go you cant beat the price on amazon i paid at my music store but i needed strings asap i will order back ups at this price this was a terrific deal my son loses picks all over the house and plays electric and acoustic so i decided to get this mixed batch and he says they are great
1263	i have been purchasing these strings for over years now only string that i allow to touch my electric guitars came on time work great for my needs geart for set ups and take downs does lengthen the strap a bit but works i played with light acoustic strings for a long time i tried these and they make for much easier action do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings maybe but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings i ll probably stick with extra light for awhile they sound great to me and i can play longer without getting sore fingers i can t say i m a polish connoisseur but this stuff seems to work very well it shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks i m not very diligent in my guitar maintenance so this bottle should last me for years i use this at home on my project studio it works great for headphone sessions i use it all the time to run an extra set of headphone in to my vocal booth closet it s all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn for the money you can t beat it its not professional quality but ive done some professional quality work with it with no problem
1264	this is a decent pop filter it gets the job done but it has a few flaws it attracts a good amount of dust the screen tends to mess up which caused me to tear the first screen the goose neck tends to unwrap it s self out of place it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in other than that it s a decent pop filter but not for the price under would ve been better i should have went with something cheaper than cough cough the auphonix pop filter cough cough but i will in the future put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a great tough i could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here i love this cable they look good and are well made too an incre iacute ble guitar cable i really recomended it i have the ft and this one ft try one these cables are flexible without feeling cheap and have solid end connectors and they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do which is why i replaced them i suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision these mics cords have solid construction going for them without the high dollar cost received in just a few days to a beginner like me they like like good strings but what do i know i ve tried a lot of strings and these are my favorites although i use the heavier mlt strings sometimes these ones bend easier the heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less both last as well as the more expensive ball and gore elixir coated strings i have used and i like the sound better i always love to d addario strings on my string guitars so i decided to order these for my new string ovation they sound great of course guitar strings can be a personal preference over the years i have been experimenting with various makes and i always seem to return to these this does not mean i will not try others i surely will continue to experiment i am one to change the strings on my guitars on a very regular basis i spend my summer in canada and winters in florida and i can assure you that the climate is much drier in canada than florida strings on my guitars left behind in florida for the summer will deteriorate quickly even if they are in a humidity controlled environment i find the d addario strings will stay in better condition than others i have been using this since the day it arrived it was very easy to setup although windows reads the device as a speaker so the usb does not work for me that way it has a great sound and i am very pleased with it i read many negative reviews on several sites i can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in g a and bb there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments this is what gives them their charm and voice i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do the set is quite nice for the price
1265	use it every time i restring my guitar works really good i recommend this to any musician that plays regulary these are my go to acoustic strings they are a quality string with great sustain and clarity i bought elixir nanos to compare and i did like them but i think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these i ll be sticking with these for the long run this guitar strap performs as expected for it s price great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started or for a backup strap there are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well before this i had been using tuner pro android app that also works well but i don t have it all the time there is one big negative it is absolutely useless outside in the sun or even shade can t even tell if it is on or off outside of that i am glad i picked the red version instead of the others
1266	haven t had this long but so far it s just about perfect i had bought another on stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness on stage my see review this one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable and only costs a few bucks more fourteen buckos at present i ve got a gooseneck and a light ish condenser mic with a shock mount on it and it s as steady as can be i m convinced even heavier loads will be no problem if you re in need of a side boom look no further love the quick release system i just hook on one end to the guitar and the other to a strap perfect for use when you are standing and playing i can just quick release it when i m done please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help in case you re wondering about the difference between this hohner harmonica holder and the hohners costing more than twice this one s price this one is made in china while the others are made in germany now i m definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of chinese made products i have in fact many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there this item however has some of the good and some of the more stereotypical problems of chinese goods pros cheap sturdy and unlike some reviewers i love the taller height far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe i also like the tighter springs though that does take a little getting used to but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort now the cons it s true what others have said the plastic neck tube smells not as bad as some have said but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable i cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at tap plastics for a buck make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee i got the diameter nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other and the neck loop was way off i did my best to bend all parts to even but the flat metal part is tough to shape the reason i didn t return it is that i figure most of them are equally uneven i just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand with little or no machine help to ensure consistency with the work i did on it myself it works fine and is now fairly even and like i said the taller height is just about right for me it s just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren t met like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides all this said the bottom line is that i prefer using this over my german made hohner holder because it s better ergonomically taller holds my harp more securely and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the nouveau single butterfly nut design of my more expensive german hohner knowing what i know of its drawbacks i m still tempted to pick up another as a back up or spare it s a great deal if you re willing to do a little work on it hi folks ok this thing is cheap that s cool but a cheap item you can t use is money thrown away before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it s too small well i want to clear this up once and for all it is too small specifically it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so depending on your guitar and it doesn t open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret even on a skinny neck this thing really is a puzzler i mean who the hell would make capos this size especially when they could ve made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid however a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele and for way cheap ha ha but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size this is utter garbage cheers soooo bummed i simply love the sound on these cans but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface not deep enough in the cups and press down hard on my ears the max time i can wear them is like an hour and then i can t wear them for a day or so due to residual pain i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups that might help also on most of my other phones the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet so it s kind of like double trouble however these really do have great sound especially the tight bass clarity if it weren t for the discomfort factor i would be using them all the time as of now i hardly use them at all in fact when i first tested these out i was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more but i m glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test of course we are all of varying shapes and sizes ha ha so they might work for you where they don t for me if so you ve got a bargain on some great cans if not ouch cheers
1267	this is a very nice cable for the price i already bent one end of it though fortunately it still works fine inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic haven t noticed any hum or crackles for sure a good buy this is my th kyser capo this one for my new ovation string cc is what i needed i always recommend all kyser capos they last forever and do not lose the strong holds we all have different tastes in guitar picks i know as i wrote elsewhere the dunlop tortex are awful for acoustic in my opinion these ultex are much better not as noisy better feel still not my favorites i ll have them with me for spares i ve been playing guitar for over years and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i v ever used they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity clack noise dunlop ultex picks sound much better cant go wrong with dunlop pick they last and don t break end up losing them verses breaking this mm is a bit soft for my liking will go a size thicker next time when i first got them i thought that they were going to be cheap as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging but it was ok i wasn t expecting much from them the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material they did not bend at all when i tried to and believe me i tried pick wearing is virtually non existent and i utilize alt picking a lot in my practices i actually learned my first sweep shred d major with these picks within a day of getting them i highly recommend for the shred guitarist my only complaint is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do becuase of the grip but i got used to it rather quickly important you can get these in packs at for only free shipping as well sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on these picks seem well made and have a solid feel but i m not sure i like the sound of them like so many other guitarists i go through a lot of picks searching for what feels and sounds the best for what i do i don t this is it for me at least not on acoustic whatever i didn t like about them got drowned out when i tried electric since i ve been playing more acoustic lately i might or might not buy these again d arrario does sell some fine strings while these are not my very very favorites strictly because i prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings they still do just fine much better than some other brands i ve tried i would not hesitate to buy them again good sounding and playing all around strings the strings definitely have a good tone though i ve got them on a low end mandolin they may be more than the mando needs but they sound great nice picks a bit small for my preference great for picking kind of harsh for strumming quality seems top notch some guitarists will love these highly recommend to everyone this is a good quality cable and never have any issues whatsoever highly recommend to everyone over the past couple of months i ve been replacing guitar straps this one seemed ideal for an everyday all around strap and it would be but the holes are too tight really a major chore to get over a strap button i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap i ve probably bought dozens of straps over the past forty plus years and i never had this problem until the latest straps i ve purchased so this strap isn t the only one with which i ve had an issue a tight fitting strap isn t in itself a problem except when one needs to take it off yikes otherwise this is a nice strap oh i tried the strap on three guitars just to be sure the first wasn t an anomaly nice strap but a bit too stiff might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying well built and good adjustability unquestionably a top of the line manual string winder but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar s headstock on some tuners this might work great but on various of mine still sloppy for now i ll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb these picks are comparable in shape and feel to grisman s dawg picks and frankly cheaper the thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and depending on how you play this may or may not be acceptable in my opinion if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge you ll get a woody warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end i play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks for guitar i prefer a mm traditional tri corner shape but that s a different review if however you re really a fan of a biting high treble sound these picks are probably not your best choice unless you re willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper in fact a pack of three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you re searching for your ideal tone if you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin chances are your attack tone and volume are generally softer and i think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you re not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it s just slowing you down for such a lighter stroke i d recommend the mm tri corner i use for guitar i like using these strap ties far more than i do tying a strap to the neck they are a great idea i found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap but eventually got it on i have two of these and i use them i d definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn t like tying on their guitar straps
1268	before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar stomp box or amp try this of the time this will take care of the problem if your amp cuts in and out also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a jack in and out of the socket a dozen times the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over good stuff i bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that i use with my bass the degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non intrusive smart looking setup i m pleased i ve owned them for a few months now no issues at all and they look good great extra light polyweb strings for guitar really impressed with the polyweb these are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don t sqeek i tried it for ipad it kinda wobbles up and down it has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my ipad i only recommend it for something light weight there s better ones out there see my review on the music stand that comes with a solid extension arm my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder the gel is pretty dense so it s kind of hard and squishy and very heavy i found that it just added more weight i m not using it i would look elswhere for a different product the question was did it meet your expectations and it certainly did it is heavy duty but also light well placed on a light duty cheapo stand it might be a little heavy but and basic quality stand will handle it no problem it really seems well engineered and made of quality material i ve read its not really complete isolated but it does the job i didn t realise how much noise my one spot was adding i a b them both one after the other and it truly was quieter the only problem i have is my tc helicon takes volts input but ma this pedal only supplies ma so the pedal didn t work in the volt slit luckily however it does work plugged into the volt ma spot so im using it there everything else in the other volt ma slots it s a lot quieter now i recommend trying it and saving some cash
1269	i own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over drive i love it it s got tone galore i play either a martin a e thru it or a strat knock off either one sounds awesome never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp let alone for battery life seems ok but i hate messing with batteries so i d buy power supply you can get a v supply check for proper polarity at the thrift store for a buck don t even think about it get it is pocket change i mean you paid for a pedal that if you want to buy from the boss it s about times this price and if you want it behringer it s about twice this price it does what is supposed to and it doesn t have a cheap look for home and garage entertainment is good enough i was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand but now that i know that i like it i m going to buy the distortion red one i m only sad they don t make a noise gate or something similar that would be the top of the deal i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a spot brand plug it is not what i received instead i received a generic plug for eight v connections that would definitely fit the purpose but a really cheap version the plugs on this generic version are larger than the spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic the original spot plug has much smaller plugs great for saving space on a pedal board and the wires are soft and rubbery again making it easier to work with on a pedal board specially if you re working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the spot plug to make sure there would be no mistake but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug i emailed them again for a refund which they promptly did i can say that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original spot plug wouldn t know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight v connectors i strongly recommend spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original spot plug this is a really strong capo the spring is very robust well padded and will not damage your instrument i have used it on guitars electric and acoustic banjo and mandolin takes some hand strength to open it but you don t want a weak capo they all work and none of them have given any trouble my pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around a lot i would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great no regrets rock on
1270	wow wow i can t believe it working wonderful i m using it karaoke online in paltalk i did compairation with somes i have it s perfect vocal i connected it with mixer alesis input i wish it s built with switch on offrecomend to buyer thanks amazon these speakers worked great for months last week one of them wouldn t power up all the way the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them and it s just a matter of time before it stops working it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake i only use them between and hours per week i contacted m audio s online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops one on the east coast and one on be west coast i ve since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m audio support site m audio doesn t stand behind their products and i ll never purchase anything from them again a light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar good material good zippers good design there are much more well padded soft and hard cases available but they take up a lot more room around the house when not in use i like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome for travel you would need better but for most uses this is a good choice should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link great product for the price i am using it with win bit sonar xl producer i just held down the set marker record button while plugging the usb cable i then let windows plug play the drivers no disk needed next i set sonar xl midi control surface device as mackie selected the nanokontrol as the control midi in and out now i have channels of automation stop back record play etc i am very happy with this product so far i have to give it stars on the price to performance ratio read the instructions i do not recomend downloading the korg software if used for sonar xl buttons and sliders and great for the price cheers having to send the first snark sn back but the replacement thus far has been flawless i made a slight adjustment to my guitar s truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on a couple tips to tuning a guitar tune it like you play it if you strum play softly then pluck tune each string softly however most people don t play softly so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes they pluck each string and wait like seconds till the ringing fades out so they are generally tuning each string as it begins softly resonating so in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat to tune your guitar correctly you really ought to pluck each string hard like every seconds and tune it that way rather than waiting for the sound to fade out if you do it this way you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you re strumming the living daylight out of it also please check your intonation your th frets should be in tune same as your open strings you pluck your open string hard tune as described above then you check intonation by pressing very lightly with just the tip of your finger and don t touch any other part of the neck on the same string but th fret and both should be in tune the exact same if they are off th open then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment please don t pay someone to setup your guitar you can do it yourself so easily go on u toob and search scott grove tuning your guitar wrong and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over guitars he spends almost an hour explaining all the details also watch his video on how to setup adjust intonation truss rod action etc btw if you can t get your snark to tune your guitar hint it s not the tuner s fault the first saddles e b g should look like a staircase going down then your next strings d a e should also look like another staircase going down if not break out your philips head tweak your intonation
1271	very good cable well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele the reason i gave it only stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor i use this cable for small home recording projects i do not take the cable around to gigs or shows as i am pretty sure it wouldn t last longer than a few months of heavy use the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy if your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job this is your product great microphone i use it with my cheap budget behringer mixer the sound is good and if i turn up the gain it will pick up everything in the room it is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals don t start layering the vocals though it starts to sound kind of weird i use this for my desk mic i use for recording it is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality especially for this price definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future bought to tune my bass works fine and at the this price it cant be beat highly recommend for budget tuner does its job good solid construction support cords seem to be of good quality knob tightens well comes with thread adapter smooth silver satin finish affordable price nuff said just buy one already nothing that spectacular really it did it s job was easy for my husband to use made me able to use a strap on my guitar pros price point does the job in the descriptioncons shielding of usb cable is abysmal very susceptible to interference could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it cheap plastic construction i m happy enough with this it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for good deal works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation it s a decent dj announcer mic or for a pa but i wouldn t record anything like singing or music and expect great sound has that great heavy mic feel but is definitely no shure mic despite the similarities i ll start off by saying that i ve had this interface for about months now and it is still going strong i think that anyone especially the beginner looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit not only does it provide channels but it also has monitor out and headphone out this could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio however i have a few gripes with the i the headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it this is purely the feel and does not really hinder performance but it makes the unit feel cheap at the controls imo the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly moving on while on the topic of knobs the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators but once again aesthetics why stars the problem must of started happening today because i never noticed it before or it could be just that maybe i never noticed it anyways shortly after i engaged the v phantom power the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing once again this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away i hope that this issue does not show up in all of the scarlett i interfaces i would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios hopefully just my unit is defective and it isn t something that is common among the i s another thing to note is that while direct monitoring is a feature on this unit the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use in other words i am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record hotter and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor nevertheless it is a feature that can be utilized though so in the end stars the packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic but yet appealing thumbs up for that i really like the build quality of the interface and focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit the only issue that i would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged overall great entry level interface sound card
1272	purchased these strings after having tried the blue steel strings my son much prefers the elixir strings they last a lot longer than the blue steel strings did and he says the elixir sound better too purchased these strings after having tried blue steel strings on my son s acoustic guitar he prefers the elixir strings over the blue steel strings he says they last a lot longer and sound better too item arrived as described and on time way larger than expected but my son loved it says it s easier to use than the smaller cloths we ve gotten before believe it or not i ve been putting off buying one i m so glad i got it now i love looking at my guitar in this thing and now i even want to pick the guitar up more than ever id have to say im happy with the quality can t see anything to complain about really i can t say i m a polish connoisseur but this stuff seems to work very well it shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks i m not very diligent in my guitar maintenance so this bottle should last me for years great polishing cloth not much to say here other than it works and works well removes all the fingerprints and polishes my baby up like new after each practice or gig can t go wrong this really cleans your strings it s fast with a couple of swipes and a lint free towel strings are clean it comes with a little towel inside the cap but not very efficient ok if you need it quick somewhere else not worth knocking it down for a little towel so i m sticking with the star
1273	this item is well built and i like the terminal ends and how they have the spring built in these aren t going to be the most durable road cables but for home and light road use they will work well i used this on my guitar tone and volume pots and it clears up the crackle feels a little oily but gets the job done and you don t have to replacethe potentiometers let s cut to the chase this is more or less a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil but that s exactly what i need to clean and protect my fretboard the lubricating feature is just a nice plus string trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts the fender medium is my second choice for picks my first is the just strings pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer less scrape feel on the strings at half the price pick choice is like guitars and amps everyone has a different opinion i was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets the action is better than my six string epiphone acoustic it sounds so sweet looks so sweet and plays so sweet i keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck i would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget it stays in tune and don t let the laminated top scare you its great not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings they are the equivalent ofernie ball slinkys yellow they play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble non touring musician s opinion also it s nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer as a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the eb sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or dr sets that come two to a sleeve in summary if you re searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren t reading this review you re out experimenting for others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more i love it and there are a lot of bold type enhancements to my acoustic now the chicken picken is much fun and i am still experimenting as with all digitech pedals i just seem to love their ease of operation the gain on this pedal without feedback is incredible first time i ordered these was in a larger order and amazon forgot to put them in the box oops i contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge thank you amazon i like the tone of d addario s bronze strings i ve been playing more bluegrass y guitar lately so i ve switched to mostly using phosphor bronze but these strings have a great warmth that i really enjoy i also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the strings amazon has the best price on these and they re inexpensive enough that i can afford to change strings whenever i feel like it i like their tone and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time i got mine yesterday and love it it sounds grate i didn t know what amp to get i looked and looked read a lot of reviews and even got on youtube to see what people had to say and seems this one had a lot of good reviews i knew fender has a good name for amps and for the money this one was the one i am so glad i got it it gave life to my electric guitar i bought mine somewhere else but still grate amp i didn t want to spend a lot of money for an amp and didn t want to get something small for or dollars less and would out grow with my music as i get better playing guitar but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will this will save me money in the long run i am very happy with it i like the five year warranty that came with it you can t go wrong great sound and its not to big nice size amp and easy to pick up nice looking amp i personally think this seagull is over rated a lot of reviewers are covering the muddy not crisp sound as mellow i don t think so i have over guitars in my collection and around of them are acoustics i have nothing against seagull or canada but bought one of these new off the rave reviews and just recently i have had both thes and fgx for five years pulled the s out for another try just because i could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used yamaha it did side by side i went through the chords on each guitar and had to finally come to the conclusion that the seagull had to go with a price tag of for the s and for it s yamaha equal the fg s unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away i would stay away from this guitar and look elsewhere oh by the way i have an s for sale i can t find a single complain about this amp the amp modelling is fantastic plug in for a mic cd m player quality driver i m not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website i used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects only thing i wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds but you can t ask for much more for the price of you won t be disappointed with this amp i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp it s got a great tone much better than the black one i had yrs ago i just downsized from a watt blues deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side i can say they sound very very similar as they have the same speaker but the bj is much lighter that being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo i was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone didn t do that on my last one this pedal works great for that too it feels very solid and it doesn t make any audible clicking noises that i can hear when engaging it am totally pleased that i did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it works great get one these are great picks and yes they are slippery the reason is the material and method of manufacturing delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl making them extremely durable and bright sounding unlike stamped picks which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions these are probably the brightest sounding picks i have ever used and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them i use the mm for s on my solid body electrics mm for my s on semi and hollow bodies and mm on my bass guitar that s right i use a plectrum on my bass you can get a pick that is easier to hang on to but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like nylon i have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself a couple of secrets to installing the mike pickup after you drill the hole and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar do this get a guitar patch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole jack into the axl and then pull it out the hole using your cable you may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help also i did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothing finding a sweet spot on smaller guitars ukulele mandolin s can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small you can t get your hand in and finger length is as far as you can go so in most cases go in the direction of the low e string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have jimi hendrix hands and in that case congratulations finally on travel guitars get rid of the giant strings that come on some of these things my sx traveller came in with s and i could not even hear the low e string i had an old set of electric s i took off of a bb king lucille and just for the heck of it swapped them out man what a difference actually so much difference that i really didn t need the axl i just installed even though it s a fun addition as far as an amp i have a little honeytone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal and just may have found a home as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the travel guitar i use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations pickups on the flyand then if it sounds ok go to the big boys in my blues room the amp will reach its max in short order but again for what it is and the price it ishard to find an equal arrived fast had them up and running in minutes it was easy to adjust my eq on my laptop to produce awesome listening music just beautiful clear nicely separated sound i wouldn t use these for high volume stuff the sound is almost delicate and very precise in its separation the classical musician s in our guild loved the sound that should tell you something stunning really they are in fact exactly what they are advertised to be top notch small room project studio monitors i readjusted my eq for the needed flat response for sound engineering and i was extremely pleased with the results the sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust as the flat studio mixing eq sounded horrible at first as it should i have been in and out of studios for years and i can say used appropriately these are excellent near field mixing monitors take time to review the set up data from m audio its good stuff and don t ask these little beauties to be everything just let them be what they were made to be and enjoy we ended up re mixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via cubase and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by just got three of these in today and compared one to a used fender standard one strap bag i also got in at the same time the chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the fender does not go thisextra step the chromacast also has many more pockets the specs on the fender and chromacast do not back up reality as the fender advertizes mm padding and the chromacast advertizes mm padding someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender this is a good medium class gig bag that falls somewhere in between a dust bag like the burswood and a deluxe mm padded bag the only thing the bag is missing is a hanger on the back which the fender does have chromacast should get rid of the plastic expensive hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone else this bag is good for in house and light use no throwing it around transport if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case at this bag is a steal
1274	the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d distortion effects pedal works great and gives me that mind blowing distortion you would only expect from a more expensive unit the only reason i didn t give it stars is it tends to be a little noisey if you turn the gain up too much you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but thats my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d slap echo effects pedal works great and gives me that old tube amp reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit there s no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d fab flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great depending on the amp and guitar you have this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer it sounds terrific with my fender strat single coil danelectro lipstick pickups on my solid state amps giving them a warm tube like overdrive it sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp it really sounds aweful with my s kramer loaded with humbucker pickups you ll either love it or hate it that will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use it s a different pedal with every combination the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d ms delay effects pedal works great and gives me as much delay as i need there s no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the delay you want with no effort at all this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great
1275	so i bought this to replace the original string winder i had that doesn t have a clipper on the end and it turned out great the clipper is strong and works well and the winder is the same if not better thank you planet waves i have an epiphone es and recently put these strings on it oh man do they sound nice it s like i got a whole new guitar once i threw these on still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy slinkkkkkkyyyy d brough this for trying electric feels on the acoustic guitar and don t want to waste too much money on electric acoustic preamp guitar or big amp if i don t like the efeels after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it i decided to give it a try i didn t expect too much on amp but surprisingly it positively gives me more than i ask for i also brough it with the adaptor which is great to save for long runs and i don t have to worry about the battery for home practices it is adorable out of the box it looks like a lovely toy but it works professionally based on its w amp i don t care much about the manufactor s suggested modes basically i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar uke i like the small size that won t take too much space on my tiny room it s cute to look at and it is practical too i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup however when i changed to another one i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup i almost thought that was an issue from the amp luckily i have two different pickups to try it deeply after using the better pickup the amp doesn t have any issue yet i have used for few times so i don t know about its longevity yet one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar s sound itself won t be muted but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp anyway it s a great feature to have
1276	i d chose this cable cause i own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end i like the idea that you can cut the power and remove the cable from the instrument with having mute the amp or mixer i recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else i own three units capable of tremolo boss tr line mm and the boss sl slicer like a tremolo on steroids plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo if you are unfamiliar tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly the boss tr is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate with three controls rate of modulation depth of modulation how much does the volume vary and a wave shape jagged square or somewhere on a continuum in between unlike the other boss stompboxes i own ce ph the tr does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like you re playing in a fishbowl as another reviewer puts it the wave control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility so it is a nice feature to have most tremolos have it but not all for the price it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy it is the unit that tom morello uses on guerilla radio and it does well with tremolo classics like the smiths how soon is now i hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest and this is something i am sensitive to because i generally turn modulations on off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time like all boss stuff the box is sturdy and i like their big quiet footswitches over any of the little clicky ones on other units the color is a sort of a dull military dark green not the most attractive thing but not bad either the small boss effects do not come with a power cable so you will have to factor that into the cost boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter but i don t know anyone who says this is a must i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine if it didn t i would not buy boss product period bottom line gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds nothing crazy not a bad price factor in a power cable simple to operate nice casing and footswitch drab color perfect retrofit for my american strat the locking mechanism is strong no problems at all i like to stay brand loyal so i honestly think these tuners will go on the rest of my fender collection tuning is a breeze and is very stable great quality casters for the money just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps you can t go wrong with these i ve noticed that the two button tremelo vibrato pedals for the fender deluxe reverb re issue and twin reverb re issue break down pretty quick this replacement so far is hanging in there i wanted an upgrade to my tu which i had for years this tu is easier to see and is more precise in it s tunings i recommend it the reason i stopped using amp stands was because i couldn t find anything collapsible and non bulky it works very well and is very sturdy i use it for a hot rod deluxe i absolutely love these strings i m used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly they have a great full sound and after breaking them in after a couple weeks of playing they give a really good classic p bass sound its not for people who want the modern brighter sound but for the classic s s and s sound these are great i received the fender cable exactly as shown in the picture it is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief it looks great was fairly cheap and built to last
1277	very easy to install rock solid and in my opinion look much better than schaller locks grab a set you wont be disappointed these just sound great huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel this isn t the best strap but it s affordable and pretty good for a beginner s guitar strap the pick holder on the strap is pretty neat however i don t find myself using it often the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar don t forget to buy strap locks you will need it what makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to pedals it comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using powers pedals that have negative tip like boss maxon ibanez etc etc even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip one of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don t stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks takes up less room on your pedal board also the plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss it can put out up to ma which is how it can run up to pedals a great item at a great price no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more this workk well however i do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range i may need new cables for me this stand is very well built not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price they don t touch the floor there are safety straps that hold my acoustic guitars fender ibanez and my anybody s guess antique in place without any difficulty so i don t have to worry about knocking them off or over it takes up very little space the biggest plus
1278	the pack is a fantastic deal i ve been around mics under for years and when compared to other mics in the range they are as good or better good lows and clean highs without any hiss absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp don t miss out on this great deal be careful i have a small recording studio so we put our cables through a lot and these guys just don t last they were fine for the first few months but then they started to die like a murder mystery seriously one after another they would just go for no apparent reason fine one second and then it would just go horribly staticky i actually had two blow at one time and thought my pa was shot thankfully it was just these cables not good spend a little extra on another brand these have been my favorite gls audio ft cable cords i am running big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is watts but runs a pair of peak super pro inch speakers and a pair of road gear subs so far i get a big punch aout of it i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine i am running a dj karaoke system i also got a pyle pro channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable item received looks diferent i say better the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile dj s for the price and quality i would buy two other ones
1279	i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic arrived as expected very solid great fit it works i probably should buy another one for other guitars but i carry in my electric case i m sure the day i will need it i will have acoustic with me i use different method for my bass but this is perfect for strings regardless of the string itself i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing so when i was earnestly considering ordering this string i read the summary in which it was stated elixir strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your dna and other contaminants ohhhh protects my string from dna yeah that dna really messes up guitar strings all right in fact it s the worst contaminant ever worse even than the oils and acids on our skin worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the dna from exposure because the dna is the blueprint of those cells contained deep within protective walls but somehow that nasty ol dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings honestly it s like none of us have ever attended a biology class because we re musicians as i read the reviews i noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo i noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from amazon hmmmm the first honest review i found was one which said these strings sound somewhat artificial ah finally one of the real reviews look the product may be good or not it may be the best string ever or not but am i going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently can t stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype we re musicians not morons if you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing a quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life no matter how heavy the marketing hype if the string is bad you ll only sell one set if it s good you don t need the hype edit follow up after reading numerous reviews this does actually seem to be a good set of strings which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldn t need spin to sell just sayin elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar d addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the elixir s these are very nice bright strings the coating is incredibly subtle almost impossible to feel on the strings i like that compared to elixir s these are a bit brighter with good feel call me old school i hate the packaging these strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag ah you know i m just so used to strings that are individually looped two strings looped together makes a mess while i m restringing a guitar when i unwrap that pair i ve got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench the neat freak in me hates that i also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag yeah i get it they are trying to be more environmentally responsible but darn it paper envelopes it feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials not some environmental cause post consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load i know d addario loves the color coded ends on my acoustic guitar that s irrelevant the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs on my electric guitars i don t like the look at all i prefer gold or silver rings at the end if the strings are in individual labeled packages there s no need for the colors d addario loves the color coded end rings so much they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging i have yet to decode their colors or naming system i normally use gauge strings in my acoustic guitar i tested these at gauge and am surprised how much i like them the slightly thicker string is not bad oddly these strings are priced almost the same as elixir s my reason for using the original d addario strings is low price if somebody is doing gigs nightly those uncoated strings are the only way to go strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician for the home enthusiast coated strings make a ton of sense they do last longer i think they are worth the premium price now there are two choices for excellent coated strings in the end the packaging the color coded end rings the crazy package coding and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar what they sound like and play like is the most important thing and in that regard these are excellent strings good strings for the price nice ring to them so far they seem to last and were a bit louder than my last strings although they were flat round and did expect them to be very loud this string compares significantly to the pro arte string the sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less it s so similar i contacted d addario to ask them what the difference was they stated the pro arte strings are made of a better nylon and to more stringent specs but in all honesty i wonder if the strings aren t identical but these marketed primarily to students and schools as a more economical string whatever is the actuality both sets are of quality manufacture they re d addario and d addario never produces junk their cheapest string is as good or better than more expensive strings in other brands i ve never used a set of d addario in any classification of guitar that i didn t like for those who are curious i d recommend doing what i did buy a set of these and a set of the pro arte they re both pretty inexpensive and compare and see which you like best or if you like both equally i think it would be good to get several reviews here of such a test between the two grades whichever set one ultimately chooses can t go wrong with the quality price ratio it is exactly as represented it does a fine job i have used it in recording live band practice sessions i would if necessary purchase this item again i see mixed reviews here at this price no telling what the quality control is like but as i wrote in another review on this type of item you can buy of these and if one fails you re still ahead of the game they re so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store well worth taking a chance mine seems to be fine doesn t look or feel flimsy at all i can t see any difference between this and what i buy in a retail package after reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp for the price about i had to try it when i plugged my acoustic into this i was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate first let s not expect double sound from a portable v amp once that reality is recognized it s realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price i would note that the sound you get out of this amp as with any amp will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you re feeding from i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different one had very rich tone another sounded tinny another had a passive pickup and required i turn the honeytune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup so it won t sound the same on every guitar that said if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good this amp is simply awesome i ve had it only one day so i haven t put it through the test of time but first impressions are that i will buy more of these in the future i need more than one portable amp my sister visited and heard it right after i opened the box and she was impressed as well neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp and i have to say the aqua color is major retro gotta luv it i ve been looking for the portable amp for some time this is the best i ve found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance i don t know as i d pay the for this guitar shops often ask but the amazon price is perfect one last thing danelectro branded v battery included same color as the amp priceless i bought this amp as a back up for my year old son and to take to the park this is a nice little amp it sounds prety good for the price just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it i can t really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings it sounds really good on my classical guitar will buy it again in the future item body is plastic rather than metal this is to be expected at this price i would not call it sturdy but at least it s instead of and it works professional musicians may not be impressed as there are some occasional noise issues as i ve found to be true with many behringer products nevertheless for what it is it works reasonably well received this item in good time there s only one real dislike i have about the item the battery access is goofy to access the battery one must take the foot pedal off by inserting an ink pen into the hinges two hinges two hands a tricky process at best not the easiest battery access i ve ever seen however to be fair relatively minor issue and not insurmountable i became relatively skilled at it in short time initially the product didn t work all i could hear was static out of the amp and thought i had a defective unit but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box turned it down and the sound got much better traced an additional problem to an old unshielded guitar cable replaced that with a good one and sound smoothed out this is a sensitive unit with a wide gain and tone range it has excellent bass and treble tuners it did seem to be somewhat sensitive to movement noises so apparently there is no noise filter of any kind in the box jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cut out that could be cord issues or box issues i ll experiment more later it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products dunno why but once the sound comes out it s difficult to discern the hiss it s not extremely loud or annoying it s just there bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price it does the job and should work fine for most instances where such a device would be needed such as with passive pickup non powered acoustic instruments i d recommend it for those who need such a thing simply because of the relative ease of use foot petal on off switch and the relative low cost it s just so so in my estimate but in some cases so so is good enough if you have an acoustic electric uke this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends beach road trip camping etc it s quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag it s not a great electric amp but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke use a volt when you need it or buy a v ac adapter to plug into an outlet you can t find a better option on a budget when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile quality sound i purchased this instrument brand new on an impulse whim due to a managers choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore it was brand new unopened in box they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase in that environment i thought it a nice instrument however it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store and that store was very busy and noisy it s when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out this is indeed a string ukulele it measures a bit over top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range the advantage to this of course is it s string so if you re a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering that is of course until you realize that while it has strings it is not tuned like a guitar it s tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe one cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned being a total newbie to ukes this was news to me until i got it home and read the instructions so my primary purpose in purchasing this to have a small portable guitar hit a snag now that s not totally the end of the thing because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning it takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn t mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup so all is not lost there it was just an unexpected surprise mainly because i didn t research the instrument prior to purchase it s rare that i impulse buy so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument that s where the yamaha really falls short this is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box that this was a rush job out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious there are no strap pegs those will require being added by hand not difficult but extra expense and time the action is of course too high that s not unusual in truth it s quite common in off the shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here however the thing that bothers me the most if i wasn t aware this is a yamaha guitalele i d think it s was a cheap knock off child s guitar there s not one thing about this instrument that says quality which is quite disappointing this instrument sells for about that low cost is obvious this is a cheap guitar in every way i can t honestly say it s a toy but it reeks beginner instrument the tuners are as cheap as they come the finish is cheap there is no decoration no protective edging the finish is unfinished i bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on amazon and i respect those reviews people have different tastes and for some folks this has a home made feel that they will love however i ve been playing guitar for mumblety mumble deca uh years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap i own two ovation guitars a peavey electric bass a hand made violin and an epiphone electric uke which is of such higher quality it s not even a contest and no i m not hawking epiphone facts is facts that s all you can read my very positive review on the epiphone on amazon when i got this home and took a good look at it i found no sign of quality or craftsmanship nothing that said anything more than this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible in truth the only positive thing i have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality other than those two factors one can find full size guitars all over amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality the only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke other than its portability i find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price consider it over priced or rather under made one must grant it s largely a matter of personal taste and expectation but low quality is low quality edit two weeks later i just today saw the cordoba at a local store a direct competition to this instrument the cordoba is much nicer it s built better has better sound and is finished out much more nicely sorry yamaha but facts is facts had i seen the cordoba and yamaha side by side i d have bought and kept the cordoba that s my honest review i know some will disagree but others know exactly what i mean this isn t an expensive instrument so one really can t expect super fine quality at this price however i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom as mentioned the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it i simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options and frankly there are this is a cheaper alternative to the string swing wall mount considerably less expensive it works fine it s easy to mount easy to adjust and holds the instrument well the only downside is that the wall anchors aren t the heavy duty plastic screw in types but the smaller drill a hole and hammer in place types which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others of course you can always purchase a couple of screw in heavy duty mounts and you ll still save considerably this of course doesn t have the beautiful hardwood finish of the string swing for the lower price you get black plastic but it s sturdy enough it looks fine and it does the job if it had sturdier wall mounts i d give it stars as it is the cheaper and less trustworthy mounts bring it stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative it is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw in mounts should hold any size guitar i bought this for my son so he could record with it he does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him i ll echo what others have said this is a superbly built instrument for the price and i don t know how epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively it looks feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much a few notes what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the vintage model is actually a super rich deep deep mahogany maroon color and it s unbelievably beautiful as others have said the factory supplied strings are crap if you judge the instrument by them you ll be disappointed include a set of aqila nylgut strings when you order this ukulele and restring it as soon as you get it i was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my kala soprano uke normally one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder fuller sound but the les paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all acoustic ukulele and that probably accounts for the quieter tone i think it s a better tone and i m more interested in delicacy than in loudness so i m happy with it if i wanted stadium filling volume i could always plug this into a stack of marshall amps oh i almost forgot one important note to all owners it is possible to remove the stupid ugly pick guard since ukulele players rarely use picks and when we do we use soft rubber or felt ones there s no need to protect the finish from scratching and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument s looks i applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails no sharp tools it came off pretty cleanly leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue i was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton without any damage to the luscious ultra glossy lacquer finish and the ukulele looks so much better now if you feel as i do feel free to do likewise just remember the key words slow and gentle don t force anything and you should be fine
1280	this thing is sturdy inexpensive and does it s job no scratches or anything on my taylor it falls over now and then but only when i run into it i have been using hercos for for many years they are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification i place a herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits for guitars i place a herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness i got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it i have a stompbox tuner but this shark is really fantastic easy to use and very accurate it makes tuning a breeze this is a great capo clamps well and quickly the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break aluminum not plastic i like it and it was well under the price of others great value
1281	only complaint is the size which is my fault if you can buy at least a foot if you plan to use it on stage they work as well as any dunlop pick they don t crack which is a big plus if you use the general fender variety i go a little thicker than i would for regular plastic picks because they get flimsy after a while take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store feels great sounds great there s a little bit of magic in these strings high quality classics add a touch of class to your sound i bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and i found them to be extremely simple and quick to install the included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue leaving the string swing solidly connected to the wall if you are hanging a lot of guitars making two rows one high and one low seems to be the best option i spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars i put up look nice and have a good tight spacing i uploaded two pictures of my wall after i had installed nine of the hangers and i couldn t be more pleased with the look the pictures are uploaded on this product page i have put up the other two hangers since i uploaded the pictures so i will have to do new pictures but the ones that i put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these the easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theblack decker bdl av all in one suregrip laser leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall i just went down the wall making dots directly on the line drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about minutes i think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional looking installation as far as the performance of the hangers goes what is there to say the included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it as long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly you will be in good shape i do not however recommend buying thestring swing home and studio wall bumper brown as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately edit i put the other hangers up now and did not drill pilot holes the anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole just mark the positions use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion then screw them in it took about minute to put a new hanger up but this was partially due to the fact that i was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line at any rate you do not need to drill pilot holes just nail and go i bought this strap for a esp ec les paul style guitar i was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price when i got the strap i was impressed the locks work perfectly and fits my guitar the back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they don t harm the finish on your guitar locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open it s not going to unlock on you strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable ernie balls are nice strings cheap durable and produce a rich sound i m so proud of my balls
1282	doe s not stay on to well moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned just changed strings on my epi les paul and this winder cutter performed flawlessly the winder fit the winding keys nicely and didn t come anywhere near touching my guitar s finish the cutter snips the strings with no effort huge time saver and works as promised very glad i bought the planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter it fits nice an tight on mic stand you can get around ten picks in it so it s a good product works well and it s clean no noise i m starting to find out even if the price is low it does nt mean it s not good for years i was lugging around a large rack case with my mackie board and a host of rack effects reverb delay compressors etc while using the rack i had a line from my programmable guitar effects pedal boss that went to a rack compressor then out to my little vox amp the internal compressor in my boss me pedal was terrible i was very happy with this set up for about years but about a year ago i stopped using the rack smaller clubs and places with too many stairs since then i went to a smaller pa soundcraft gigarac and some active mackie speakers and started using that terrible compressor in the otherwise decent boss pedal a few months ago i took out my old box of effects pedals and built a small pedal board this worked great but i couldn t locate my old ibanez cs compressor and years ago i know gave away my mxr i needed a compressor pedal for my new pedal board that worked as well as the alesis seems like i found a winner this mxr clone from behringer seems to work as well if not better than the mxr and is much quieter some people have mentioned a slight bump on the upper mids of the compressed signal and i agree that it is there but it s not hiss or added noise and i like the sound my main guitar is a mid s epiphone sheriton and it sounds great through the behringer dc i can t comment of the durability because i haven t had it that long but the case is metal and everything feels solid i don t crank up the compression too much and i leave the pedal on about of the time to control the overall signal from my pedal board my pedals in order ibanez ts ibanez super tube a pedal that was made between the ts and ts a cheap chorus pedal ibanez de delay into a behringer dr reverb for this compressor does just what it s supposed to do it s a two knob sqeezer just like old mxr and just works no need to worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings two knobs one to set the overall compression and one to adjust the output volume great simple pedal clean sound update i have had this pedal now for about years i notice one reviewer said that the bass sound dropped out on his guitar signal with this pedal i have to admit that this is true it s not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable this pedal is not something that i would use too heavily it does a nice job compressing peaks and overall range and gives you a nice smooth sound if you are looking for a guitar pedal to sustain the sound you may want to look at other pedals this is just a basic compressor not a true sustainer and at high levels it will probably make you sound very thin as the compression ratio gets above or higher on the other hand most stomp pedal compressors under will do pretty much the same thing my alesis rack compressor will knock the punch out of a signal at high levels also the sound is clean but it s best used for a little compression not the huge amounts needed to call it a sustainer try the behringer cs for more sustain its one great modeler i like the tweed that old tube sound and mic position on cabinets i am using this with bass gives you a really clean treble and distortion if you like also try it with bass you will like it rock on i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments this is a nice little pedal it effectively quiets all my other pedals works as advertised not much else to say get one more likely known as a guitar compensation device the effect itself it widely used in everything i have couple few behringer pedals some complain about plastic housings but a i don t beat my gear and b plastic doesn t get rust and corrosion the build on behringer are tough and fine to me and the prices make them attainable to all players the only thing i say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals gotta spring for power supply plug if not now eventually because it ll drive you nuts compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just can t not have if that s your thing the sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build so even a cheap one can ring like the best so you got both in one tailoring will add life to even a dull axe some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you can t do without once you find em in a world of round wound strings flat wounds the original bass starings aren t as popular these are nice and bright love em
1283	when i first saw this item i wondered why is the regular guitar version and the bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and i realized the bass version only has to tune four strings instead of six so it costs less because we don t need to use it as much but then i remembered there are string bass guitars and i thought okay shouldn t they have a one for string bass guitars sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when i realized with some dismay that there are even string bass guitars will this even work on a string bass after all that s more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside i find this to be an excellent and ideal tool its function is three fold string winder string cutter peg pullerso no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string all the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably priced tool made by d addario the quality lives up to the brand it s solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed it does everything it s supposed to do does it well and is of good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons the winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use i would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening because of this design flaw stars instead of i note that there are reviews here as old as four years and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys what i believe is that it is a mistake to sell the bass and standard guitar version on the same page from what i can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the bass guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity it s obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge the one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn t careful the same holds true for needle nose pliers bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they re doing don t get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using any modification tool i suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings to in seconds they may wind up damaging their guitar turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see and take your time and this device should work fine be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date dunno why the company didn t simply start a new listing when redesigning the device be careful about using capos like this because if you re using a fine guitar it may damage the finish try it and double check regularly and i wouldn t leave it clamped on the guitar overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand i have of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolins they attach to the wall with screws hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall it takes about a inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone rubber which protects the instrument the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again very sturdy well made product i can t compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder i use i have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar i own and every student i ve ever had has one on their guitar as well they are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding they stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time they can be easily removed and relocated after relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location i have had as many as picks stored in one and as few as one pick stored in others no matter how many picks you store or for how long the spring action loader never loses its resistance i highly recommend these i personally will never even try any others as i am so pleased with this product if you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks this is the product for you i ve been using these on my acoustic guitars and straps for over a decade they re sturdy and convenient and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap the ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage or when you don t need the strap hanging from your guitar e g sitting in a chair works exactly as advertised i ve purchased several of these and can t say enough good things about the product and company not an exciting item i ll admit but they work as advertised and i do love having strap buttons on my instruments i clip this pick holder to my music stand and it s always handy and very easy to use i use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder made of durable nylon with pick pocket given stars shipped on time and at good price i recommend this item this is a good quality product as advertised fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument i am satisfied i ordered this strap to use with both my concert tenor ukes it just works i already owned a ukulele leash type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke s sound hole or tie it off to the head the problem of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body sometimes disastrously with a strap like this one you can completely let go of your uke it stays perfectly in place chord changes strumming become easier when you don t have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow the length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke and uke player sizes it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke the other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way in my case i installed two buttons more convenient and the strap doesn t interfere with my chord hand here are the buttons i used strap buttonsif the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant put your fears aside it can be done quickly easily and the end result is well worth it here s an entertaining how to video that will walk you through it
1284	these are good strings for a good price i have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time my son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand it comes with a cord that has a standard inch end i plugged it into a small guitar amp they use it mainly to sing along with their cds mp s note that this is not really a mic i would use in my studio it is more of a toy to be honest but a quality toy for a young child in that regard i give it five stars i tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both i didn t think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp it appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner i would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet i don t know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner update the more i use this tuner the more i like it it is easy to read and use and doesn t appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was of course i am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used lots of juice easy settings very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need i haven t jacked it up all the way i don t think the cat would appreciate that i get a little feedback every so often occasionally it s a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar but not enough to submarine this power packed amp how do you get that much noise out of an speaker this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost tom times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one
1285	these do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome or a mix from a soundboard perfectly they are certainly worth the price i purchased this for use with a sennheiser e s microphone and the bestselling on stage boom microphone stand the mount has exceeded my expectations the fit for the stand is perfect with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down the part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out a screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase this is a perfect compliment to my current set up i needed a desktop stand for voice overs when my usual recording set up wouldn t do the trick this stand is sturdy and worked perfectly a great buy as the price was perfect as well did a ton of research out there b i bought this i can t believe that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal what a racket it is if i could make one i would this one was cheap and does the job dunzos this is an absolute must have item for any gigging drummer holds your drink just like it says it will what more can you ask for out of a drink holder no more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy at least not unintentionally pro
1286	i have owned other capos but this one is simply the best i doesn t take up a lot of room on the fret yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it i m a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything i play i however am having a ball playing as loud as i want with as much or as little gain as i feel like at the moment with my classic rock guitar headphone amp my rickenbacker sounds just the way i want with as much clarity or with all the smoke as i feel like dialing in for now it is so nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in put in my ear buds and practice for a while anywhere i want anytime i want downside i wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size vox amp and the controls are small hard to read but easy to learn you do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time solution hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive i plan to pick up other versions of the amplug from vox to extend my fun this was a good choice buy one my c ce washburn has been a very good purchase i was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords i prefer guitars having solid woods not laminated like this one it has the ability to plug into an amp has easy access to the battery has a built in easy to use tuner and the wiring dose not rattle about it has a good compensated saddle the frets are level and do not buzz has a truss rod in the neck and has a bound rosewood fingerboard i have always liked the sound of classic guitars like the option to plug in and am more impressed by sound than brand name a person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck this is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar it rings out very well so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in mine has some edges not well stained likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly top is a bit wavy from buffing still has some orange peel but not a lot lastly the nut and saddle are too high for my preference some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top sort of a classic color that i have gotten used to now other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs this model is not i was not clear enough above where i mentioned laminated woods if something happened to it i would be likely to replace it with another one just like it a very cost effective good sounding well made guitar good job washburn not only are they inexpensive but they hold up very well i have a ton because i keep one on the end of each guitar furthermore they are very accurate as well so worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time i want to change tunings bottom line inexpensive well made accurate time saving buy it now
1287	these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best the behringer ucg device is an aging yet affordable piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the usb port of a computer this opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones for the budget player it could be argued that a mere investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilities however while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly there are some significant problems here first and foremost there is the problem of getting the device to work getting the software to recognize it and configuring it to run without significant latency which is a delay effect where you don t hear a played note immediately when it s played which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible the ucg runs on an asio driver they include an older version with the software and you can snoop around online and find other options but that doesn t mean it will necessarily work with your software or work well if it does for example audacity is a popular freeware program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer i ve been told that audacity doesn t work with asio drivers and when i got it to record the latency issues rendered it unusable you do receive two other software options with the device the first is energyxt which i believe includes a license for the compact version in theory this program should work like audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects in addition to drum and bass track loops however i have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program i m sure it can work but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out that s really not ideal for a budget product the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments so far this has been the most impressive of the options offered you can demo three different amp simulators vox fender and marshall and then enter a code to unlock one of the three i like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp which allows you to dial in some realistic tones it s also the only program i ve been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in there are problems with recognizing mono vs stereo i adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to miliseconds which is just into the range where i don t notice it as a problem still while the models sound good i m not sure how often i would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recording shortly after ordering this device i discovered that my sound card has a blue line in audio jack on the back by running a simple to audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card i can do direct recording which is monitored through my computer speakers no latency and sounds great even better this method works through audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks if the ucg worked as advertised it would be a more convenient way of doing this but i simply can t recommend it for most people i feel like there s star potential somewhere in this device but i doubt i ll ever have the patience to unlock it stars the snark sn is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate i beg to differ this is the most accurate headstock tuner that i have ever used and it also has a built in metronome which i never use but could come in handy another thing is the price point which is simply amazing the blue color is a bit annoying however and i d like it if they came out with a black sn the visibility of the screen is amazing and i can see it even with the sun reflecting off of it or in a completely dark room true meaning of the us dream it is hard with a soft overtone giving a sense of calm and well being wow yes that is it no more to be written joy o the american dream
1288	this is a great pedal to put at the end of your fx chain i have it as the last on my pedalboard before my gnx it s always on it only took me about a week to settle on how i liked it adjusted there are only two knobs i just played around with them untill i was happy with the sound i do a lot of recording i also checked the sound after recording can t reccomend it enough especially considering the price this is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars adjust your volume of the main mix and adjust your instrument mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for more me in their monitor you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want very fun to use comes with a power supply very easy to control i enjoy using this to play alone it is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it it can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat
1289	i haven t really used this guitar stand because i have been keeping my acoustic guitar in the case so i can keep the humidity nice adding water to a sponge i cut and placed into a plastic bag that i poked tiny holes in with a small nail the stand works as advertised i wanted to experiment with a thin pick i like the action but thinner picks tend to click over the strings and i don t care much for that these are certainly pretty though and the feel is typical fender celluloid smooth and a little slippery might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i don t i do all my own guitar maintenance which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings etc i had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench so looking around on amazon i found this handy little device it s small works well and fairly inexpensive my only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all plastic construction but don t get me wrong it s still pretty strong just don t put too much weight on it while using it i bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction one of the features i like is that it just doesn t take up too much room and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand this is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars this only gets done once a year on the average guitar so if you re like me this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes other than that it is what it is and does what it says the applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards doesn t say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned simple easy to use tuner awesome price works on guitars and basses i am very happy with this product very portable too
1290	this hosa cable is very well made with good quality connectors and a nice long length my son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected this cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable highly recommended cfh great for video photo work or even theater it won t handle well at a large space if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation what i ll be using it fordj work to show laser beams and light beamsvideo work use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site that s what you are seeing in movies photo work not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an iso i bought the ts version of these cables and they have served me well these are of the same quality and a great value for the price i got this to compliment my filming of events concerts etc after my first test recording when i played back the audio using the built in speaker i really thought that i had been duped into believing this device was studio quality then i listened to that same test recording using headphones and wow this has got to be heard to be believed there are so many applications for this recorder it s ease of operation and quick start up time make it ideal for hurried set ups
1291	what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it don t get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to e flat much easier than on a non chromatic tuner but that s all i use it for i prefer my older tuners that light up this screen is really dim and there s not a back light my guitar room isn t super bright and it s very difficult to read guess that s why the price is so cheap this violin is amazing considering it s price i got it for my girlfriend expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn t she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked i am a satisfied costumer for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it this one s for you basic but sturdy gets the job done many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use install hangars they are reliable so far they do not hurt anything on your instrument i am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars violin how self adjusting can they be apparntly quite very good for a quick tune up might be a little to tight for checking intonation very fast readout and fast on off
1292	i ve been playing guitar for years and personally i would prefer cleartone or elixir strings i bought these for my little sister and she loves them they have a really nice sound to them i feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these i m just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best i like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound the price is right i have used this on my les paul it proved to be very functional the size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit in the past i have used the ns capo which is more compact this one is harder to lose because of its size i also appreciate the even tension across the strings much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings strung these up on my lp goldtop with p s d addario promises these strings to be comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations that result in greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings i dunno anything regarding the science behind this but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker a and d strings compared to the regular set of d addario s they offer its not a huge huge difference but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance for one thing they re pretty stiff they bend but not easily maybe that s what they mean by balanced tension they re also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated s not flatwound mellow by any means but not quite as bright as your regular set of s i do get a great rock tone out of them mind you but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound personally i like the tone i get out of them they re big and warm without being dull sounding but again your preferences might differ one thing that s great about these strings is once they re properly stretched they stay in tune forever again maybe this is part of the balanced tension and if so good job d addario i haven t had them on forever to really see how long they last but they ve been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one who would these appeal to well if you like really light strings that bend easily you re not going to like these if you re a rythm player who does long gigs the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you
1293	i use the mm dunlop gator grip for twenty years the non slip surface doesn t take long to wear off but i have a work around i ve even put them in a vice and filed new points on them i prefer an extra heavy pick because there s no delay from pick deflection i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably in fact they were so good that i purchased ten more when i went back to the same music store my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman dawgs the round side of the xh dunlop gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone i would recommend these to anyone these exl gauge d addarios are good strings at a good price they sound nice and bright on my epiphone sheraton ii and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale which i like i d rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time the strings don t break either it s a strap it s pretty well made it holds your guitar on your body so you can play it it costs or less delivered what more could you ask for in a strap there may be better ones out there but at more and this does the same thing if you want to breathe new life into an old guitar for about then this kit is for you changing your pickguard and hardware is a great way to give your guitar some personality and help you stand out from the pack
1294	so good that i bought another one love the heavy cord and gold connectors bass sounds great i just learned last night how to coil them up i guess i should read instructions more carefully but no harm done still works great i deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars basses amps fx midi gear etc over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy noisy pots knobs input and output jacks that are crackly etc in the past i ve tried some locktite electronics cleaner which is provided in a similar can it would rarely work in contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear i ve used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks it s really like magic in a can granted i m no expert on what s out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials this is my first foray into that world but i ve used it and it s easy the polish is great the cloths are soft and just what they should be the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff everything here is as far as i can tell just as advertised a way to keep one s instruments in good shape i now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory and there doesn t seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar like perhaps some fly by night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there and knowing the way the world works i m sure there are some probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth or stars on the amazon review i don t know but come on this stuff is just fine most ax tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should psychoacoustics being what it is i can t honestly tell you for sure electro harmonix tubes are measurably better than the no name chinese tubes i replace but i think the electro harmonix tubes sound better therefore they do at per shot who cares i suppose i could contrive a double blind experiment to settle the existential question empirically but i d rather spend my time playing rest assured electro harmonix is good stuff and the price is right just do it not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive no assembly instructions were included in the packaging i ve never owned something like this before so that was annoying luckily some nice pictures were posted on the web page and i was able to figure it out from there once i got it put together and placed my beloved guitar in the thing i got happier it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish i d recommend this stand to others but be aware of shipping tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still its a nice stand cheap but should suffice i wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine if you can drill into wood with a wood drill bit then these are for you i bought mine for an amp stack and now when i record i can simple roll the head and cabinet into the small room and record you get in the package with wheels and retainers thats thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet pretty simple not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this good quality xlr cable that works fine i m happy with this purchase
1295	i m a professional musician and love these cables they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables i ve been using i like fender mediums always have but i gotta branch out man not sure about these picks yet the feel a little more stiff my usual i want them to last longer what happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round i have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings within days of installing i play professionally and have a lot of experience installing strings nothing wrong on the guitar hopefully the next set will be better currently using this with the blue yeti microphone and the blue radius shock mount when fully extended the arm can t hold the entire weight of the shockmount yeti microphone i rigged it behind my monitor wall mount frame didn t want to mount the montiors to the walls and it works just fine not as fancy as a retractable arm but it does the trick just fine i ve had this stand for about years and have used it on stage for the last years pretty steady the first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and i immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it it s plastic plastic and cold don t mix the retainer piece broke and went flying and i was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig i managed to get it back together but now i have to be very careful when extending the neck the other part that i ve been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks it has come up completely off and i must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off i won t mark this stand less then stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions which is very good advice long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod this mic is fantastic i ve been singing writing and recording for almost years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive german mics i ve used in larger studios over the years there s a very slight presence peak but nothing like most of the other chinese mics it isn t shrilling or peaky at all male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for eq whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub hz stuff this mic is also an excellent candidate for a michael joly mod he calls it one of the audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under michael mods these mics and you d be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous u with the german name that starts with an n i m using it totally stock and it s been great buy it does its job good solid construction support cords seem to be of good quality knob tightens well comes with thread adapter smooth silver satin finish affordable price nuff said just buy one already i ve purchased a couple of of the blue foot mic cords from this seller before same as these i ve had them for well over a year used in live music at least times a month they ve been stepped on and treated pretty rough they are still supple and easy to wind up in contrast i have other mic cords from a different manufacturer and the set screws have fallen out they are stiffer and just haven t held up as well having the multicolor cords makes it a lot easier to see which channel on the mixer is connected to which mic very inexpensive yet reliable cord highly recommended i m a professional musician playing times a month this pedal does far more than i need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles i really like the second looping function that s plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative don t forget to order the external power supply i would have happily paid a little extra money to have it included not sure why it s not double a batteries last a longer time than i expected they would i haven t had a chance to play with customizing patches etc but i m sure that i ll be pleased with what it has to offer i ve been using gls cable for years now and i never had a problem with it they re good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it i love this little guy clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you it will still accurately tune the guitar very easy and simple to use i paid for it and it is times better than the one i have
1296	let me begin with a public service announcement if you want to buy other ezdrummer expansion packs you need to buy this product first important update toontrack is scheduling the public release of ez drummer in may if you buy ez drummer from now until then you will also get the download for bear in mind ezd is a completely new different program from ezd and so i would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock ezd pop rock kit which has some very kit pieces in addition to the ezd default kit which is more reminiscent of the rock expansion kit from what i ve seen ez drummer also gives you the ability to mix mash kit pieces from all expansions and so to me this makes ez drummer a must buy based on the sheer customization available resume normal programming if you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit ezdrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you ll find it s very easy to use very easy to program and overall a well made product you might be tempted to compare ezdrummer to its bigger and better brother superior drummer made by the same company superior drummer is superior to ezdrummer but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close to life sounding virtual instrument there are ways to improve the off the shelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately youtube has plenty of video tutorials on this but what you want to do is open up your digital audio workstation pro tools cubase etc and set ezdrummer for multi track output from there you ll be able to tweak the different outputs ezdrummer has as if you were in a studio and had mics at your disposal most high end professional studios use about mics to capture everything on a drum kit and so virtual mics is nothing to scoff at kick drum snare top and bottom toms cymbals overhead and room once you have each of those outputs running you can perform individual eqs to change the tone dramatically adding a touch of distortion gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound really close to life in reality once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced it only takes a trained ear to tell that it s a virtual kit as far as the expansions go if you are looking to record a particular style of music then i highly recommend buying the ezx kit that goes with that genre the stock rock kit is very good after performing the mods above but only for rock as for me personally i did my best to eq and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone but in the end i found the rock kit lacking especially since it s a tight kit toms cymbals hi hat snare kick i bought this pedal years ago and like most guitarists who buy new gear i fell victim to confirmation bias regarding the reviews i gave to my musician friends upfront the pedal sounds great in the store if you demo this pedal you ll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer but over time you ll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself turn any of the knobs past and you ll get some undesirable nasal hissy tinny frequencies that require compression noise gating and eq to tame the top boost does provide what it advertises but if the pedal itself is already dimebagged and you engage the top boost it just sounds weird and unmusical electro harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer but i think they overstepped their bounds with this one where is this pedal now in my collection sold for cash after deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a boss me multi effects to simplify my gigging setup i figured as nice as it is to have an analog distortion like the metal muff it would never compete with the digital distortion onboard the me boy was i wrong after getting the me i did an a b test and the me took home the gold easily this came at no surprise considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds what would i recommend you purchase that depends if you re in a metal band and you re recording an ep no pedal in my opinion comes close to fully cranked tube amp distortion however if your amp doesn t have a good distortion channel or capability then a more conservative and affordable boss ds for a more musical metal tone the reality is most manufacturers have great distortion pedals so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone since no two distortions sound the same personally i recommend the mxr fullbore metal the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff the noise gate and mid scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a top boost the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob which can dramatically shape the overall sound bottom line up front if you play an orange vox or marshall you don t necessarily need an eq pedal but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level why is this well the brits design their amps with wide and musical eq but the overall frequency response is narrow this has led many british amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that british eq isn t as dramatic as american guitarists want it to be there is nothing wrong with this by any means it s just an overall characteristic of british amplifiers secondly any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost db seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty or dirty to overdrive or overdrive to distortion live performance if you re in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs you ve probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass midrange noise hz that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter applying eq to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low end from the picture and boosting your high end for better clarity recording direct in if you re using this pedal with a di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping you ll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your strat or brighten your les paul why stars yes the noise it s not bothersome by any means but if you re recording with a mic d amp or direct in you will absolutely need a noise suppressor i use my ge with the boss ns and the ns completely removes the white noise generated from the ge the result is an amazing clean boosting eq if you re on the fence go ahead and get this thing you won t regret it it s not just for tone snobs it can really make cheap gear sound way better and take great gear to the next level bottom line up front the mxr fullbore metal is a high octane distortion suitable for modern metal music it s band eq with adjustable midrange q gives the mxr fm the ability to model virtually every other distortion out there what i like about the pedal is that it s small easy to operate and doesn t take much time to dial in the tone you want i play with a marshall jcm dsl going into a a x using a les paul standard and it sounds amazing i love the onboard marshall jcm flavored tube distortion but it is more in line with the new wave of british heavy metal obviously and not entirely suitable for modern american metalcore the mxr fullbore metal gets me to where i need to go this is nice because i can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel and then tap the fullbore when i need to play metal what i dislike is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise so you have to be careful with the treble and mid q knobs however i also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amp s eq settings as well so know in advance you ll need to spend a good minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposes what about the eh metal muff i owned a metal muff for years and this pedal totally blows it away the big selling point about the mm is that it has a top boost big deal i wrote a review for the mm on amazon but in summary the top boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical comparing the top boost to the noise gate in terms of the big selling point the fullbore s noise gate which has adjustable sensitivity to me seems like a much better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to sound what about the boss me i currently own an me and being totally honest i think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarist s give each other about multi effects is because in their mind they think an old fashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is real whereas multi effects pedals are fake this might be true to some extent but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains that at some point the trade off does indeed make sense fyi dave mustaine uses a digitech gsp as part of his live rig endrant anyway the boss me has only a few settings useful onstage but not so much for recording since in the end they do sound a tad digital and the me compresses your signal the mxr fullbore does not compress and sounds analog so it wins for recording purposes i bought this pedal because i wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my metal ep i m self recording in conjunction with an ada gcs i created an all analog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing check out the ada gcs if you can it s an amazing speaker simulator and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was it s own x combo amplifier anyway through the gcs the fullbore basically sounds like a mesa boogie why only stars the fullbore isn t for everybody it isn t for every guitar or every amp but by itself it s really friggin good i suppose if it had a band eq and a ax preamp circuit it would be the best metal pedal but for a small piece of gear it s probably the best analog distortion on the market
1297	i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on she absolutely loves it everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it you can t beat this for the price my son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar it hasn t failed him yet it s easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly he says it s a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings highly recommend second one i bought lousy build quality and only lasted months went through two of these before i learned my lesson don t waste your money on this junk i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk this is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back at full price of it is a solid deal any lower and it is a steal leather straps are a little tricky to buy online you can t feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing and every piece of leather is different most of the time with leather straps you get the quality you pay for this one appears to be an exception to that rule but if you are looking for buttery soft fine corinthian leather with gold stitching you need to understand that you ll have to pay more if you want one made from wild buffalo leather or free range mastodon hide you ll need to hitch a ride in the tardis if all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won t let you down this is a safe bet oh and tight strap button holes that s a good thing in my universe as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel on this planet anyhow this is exactly what i was looking for the protect my investment i tried purchasing a soft case that had the seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar it didn t it was way too short for my seagull s coastline this is a sturdy case that looks good too
1298	i first want to mention that this is a pack of picks the product description didn t mention that but i was pleased to receive more than three my son told me he needed some new picks and since lately he s been playing ozzy osbourne songs i knew he needed a better pick than the standard fender picks he s been playing with for three years after hearing him play with these picks i ve noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these the finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level my only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks i wish we could choose the color or maybe they could send a color assortment we ll be buying these for a long time to come nice quality and love the cutter the winder is a little awkward to use i guess i need a little practice but the cutters are great the shell and the lining of the case are perfect hard on the outside and soft on the inside i opened up the box and my epiphone dot slid right in the only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen i m not traveling around with my guitar too much so that s not a problem for me but i would worry a bit if i were checking it on an airline otherwise it works perfectly for what i bought it for protecting it in my mancave basement from dings and scratches first of all i liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord the jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief it sounds ok for the price the cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth just feels right for the job so these are pretty great strings not much to say the price is really good about ten dollars a set which is really good saves your thumb on the strum grips nicely in your fingers but not on the strings a totem of rock and roll in your grip i had put these on and my wife picked my guitar to play and she was confused they do take some time getting used to they don t rip up your hand as much and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift there is less friction this is good but it takes some getting used to i used that finger tip friction to let me know where i was on the fretboard with these i found myself over shifting both high and low i like them and they sound nice but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes i really dig these i have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks and the worst thing is that when i drop them they are impossible to find on my beige carpet the one i m using has barely worn with at least hours of playing on it the size of the pick is the same as normal it is just more tapered i tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it but it was a little to much work as i dipped it too far into the strings so i reverted back to a wider gator grip which works better with the bigger strings i am still searching for the world s perfect all purpose pick this works until then like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder thank you highly recommend to everyone who play guitar these picks are fantastic but smaller then picks i ve used in the past but easy to hold onto due to the shape and texture very durable believe these are smaller for jazz use
1299	no problem at all great quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand thak you very much this selector is very basic but does the job if you need an a b box for simple set ups give this one a try it works for me and i dont see anything wrong with it is simple affordable and functional what else can you ask for so i originally got the virtually identical mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after a couple of years of easy work behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most i use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack so much more efficient than a floor monitor i have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips and because there is more than one channel i can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics definitely recommend hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space love it fast easy to use effective small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate a must have for any musician the saddle after some minor rounding at the edges fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my takamine acoustic i haven t replaced the nut yet but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable these are high quality parts well worth the relatively small investment edit i have since replaced the nut too and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one but the difference is negligible and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort
1300	well the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning am i impressed u bet cha this thing is simply beautiful it arrived well padded in a double box initially i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws none not a finger print on it anywhere this guitar is extremely well made and put together right it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter the neck is slim which is good for my thick hands and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities i put a quarter under the th fret and it s right on the money it s considerably heaver than than i thought i would imagine it weighs about lbs i have a strap ordered and on the way the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had your hand floats over the frets i don t think you could get a better piece for the price point i ve been using a crybaby for going on years now some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way well i ve never noticed to me these always feel perfect also you can adjust which part of the sweep you re using very easily ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little comb that moves the wheel on the pot i ve tried other wahs morley doesn t do it for me and the vox is very good i just have always gone with what i knew no complaints with the crybaby this bag is light with two back pack straps a pocket for accessories excellent quality material and a good quality zipper if you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it i am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good i have world tour bags to keep my axes safe nice padding nice features takes you hours to play around with all the sounds built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage nice and loud in a small package
1301	love this kit it has everything you need as well as cleaning cloths make your axe shine and look like a rockstar this is one of the quietest mixers i ve ever used the range of adjustability is excellent channels fill up quickly but i ve mixed at a time and nearly no noise at least i don t hear any this should be your first pedal for bucks you get every effect except distortion no other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck it s clean high fidelity and versatile as a swiss army knife there s not much to be said about this pedal it just works it s my fourth cheapy behringer pedal and i have been pleased with every one of them this pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right i play punk blues and country and this pedal helps me obtain the entire range of sounds necessary for my various styles even on a cheap amp upgrading to a marshall next month this gets the job done people who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine imo it s a good solid plastic that holds up well and if it drops the price to instead of that just makes behringer effects more accessible than that other brand this is the best string cleaner i have owned to date and i have owned about all of the rest the way it is packaged makes it super easy to pop the lid and apply it the casing is tough enough to be thrown into my gig bag and carried all over without the lid coming off or the case breaking the other string cleaner that is a bottle with cloth applicator spills out and the cloth wears out too fast then leaves cloth pieces on the strings this product does not waste the cleaning agent it applies evenly and there is no cloth residue left on the strings to pick off the cleaning agency works so well it looks like i have cleaned a bbq grill when i wipe my strings down amazing how dirty the strings get after just a few hours of play this product will get that gunk off i am done looking for a better string cleaner because this product has the best cleaner in the best packaging for travel well done fender
1302	i bought this eq pedal to use with a s amp project i replaced the speaker and needed some mids so i bought this pedal to use for a clean channel the eq and boost works great for being a plastic box i have seen the f c be called pure gold in a plastic box on a telecaster forum and read reviews all over the net saying the same thing the eq works wonders for tone and is priced less than it s mxr and boss counterparts i am not going to rehash all the other reviews but i use it with a bass guitar amp and it works surprisingly well with the old amp and a passive bass the boost combined with the low bass eq s works wonders for low end i use a boss ge eq pedal with a different amp and the f c works as well as the boss as long as you don t mind the cheap construction from danelectro i do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesn t matter to me i am wondering how long the switch will last though but at this price who can be critical some danelectro pedals can be sorted into the novelty realm but this one is actually very functional and can open up all new sounds i also tried the eq with a telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end i hope this lasts as long as my old all plastic fab distortion that i bought used for good short cable plugs easy i was messing around with the wiring in a mim strat and i ended up melting the switch so i ordered this one to replace it worked out perfect i ve used the fx for a couple of years i ve got a pedal board with several pedals but if i had to take only one pedal with me and i often do when i have to travel lite this is the pedal i take not only do i get a full selection of effects but the pedal doubles as a di unit solving input issues on some problem sound systems i ve played thru that s probably an unintended benefit but i find it a valuable feature which gives me confidence to play thru any system fyi my buddy s digitech multi effect pedal actually introduces hum into systems where this fx has helped me get a cleaner sound while this unit has no tone adjustments it also adds something to make my guitars sound better i know that is sort of vague the only down side of this pedal that i have found is that because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal it is a little hard to make precise adjustments but with what this pedal does do for me that s a small price to pay for this price i can t see why anyone would not like this pedal
1303	works for practice it s a guitar instrument cable what can i say maybe not the best but it serves it s purpose even though these are folk strings i put them on my year old dread and they sound really good i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing so far so good the small e string and the g string both broke on the ball end while tuning i haven t broke a string while tuning in years never ever had one break on the ball end luckily i bought the three pack but i can t recommend this product
1304	i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar i would have given this item stars but even fully extended it is about too short as for the quality of the strap i love the look and feel of the leather it has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer my cents in summary i think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric this strap would work much better if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin ny i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar this is a great basic mic stand for live and studio use although i don t suggest using this and playing guitar great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments it does not come with a mic clip so you ll need to get one it s a great deal buy it
1305	this little box will give it to you i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains i count in my little arsenal with fuzz distorions auto wah a compressor octaver bass booster and a nice di box the mxr eq helps me a great deal to recuperate definition and clarity after this long effect chains that i love a great little box so if you are looking for clarity definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the mxr eq will do the trick cheers doa no good out of the box plug it nothing no way to send it back i m not from the states meaning i just wasted away something bucks add shipping i did bought a behringer pedal before tremolo pan with good results but i guess there s two sides to this particular low economy pedals well i ll man up and buy something else it is simple accurate takes up very little room and has several modes that are nicely backlight to top it all off it s about half the price of any other pedal tuner korg king of the practical tuner world i had a custom made pedalboard made with wood also it was great in therms of protecting my pedals and with the space but maan it was heavy only with pedals and that was getting me problems with my back and shoulders with this i have pedals and i wont say that its not heavy bcuz it is but is the same weight but i got pedals thats a huge difference the only thing that i maybe dont like is the bag i know it wont last a lot of time but in general is the best pedalboard ive had and i wont change it maybe for another bigger like the pt but still gonna get pedaltrain the best yes finally after reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders i hit the nail ok i play in a really loud metal band none of us are record savvy or anything like that we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out but we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember that riff for the next rehearsal we tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice well the zoom h n changed everything simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just well incredible for such a little thing no distortion of any kind just be careful where you place it i still need to read a lot of the users manual but take my word i hate those manuals i figure how to use it extremely basic and just hit the rec button and rock out finally when i came back home i plug it into my pc and i was amazed by the quality of the sound we recorded in ch mode with two extra mics and man i havent even tried the multi channel mode yet thanks zoom now rocking and basic recording it s how it s supposse to be simple and fun cheers
1306	i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc they work well for that the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head after a time the pinch is bit much i have a small hat size too however the price was great and the sound is good i m no audiophile but do play guitar mando and dulcimer and for me these phones deliver a good well rounded sound one other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor use so if you can deal with the pinch i highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality this pickup is pretty good at lower volumes but it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume the pickup is very over sensitive also spend some time where exactly you place the pickup it makes a big difference try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something this was for a friend who liked the way the guitar pikup worked that he ordered more for his family members pros price point can t really go wrong clean signal no self noise works for a tunercons for recording or amplification purposes this thing picks up a lot of attack noise fingers dropping on the strings bow clicks etc additionally the clamp does not always solidly grasp the instrument and shakes around a bit god help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified
1307	this dunlop pick holder work good for an in expense product it is want i need for travel little hard to put picks in but ok this is a fantastic little capo i say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type of the shubb capos i ve used it has a low profile and i can reach right up to it and still play well it seems to be sturdy and well constructed and i love that i can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings just enough so they don t buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off much cheaper than the g th and does the job just as well in my opinion for everyone saying that you can t fit it on the neck make sure you get the right capo if you have a classical guitar get a classical capo if you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo if you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks get the normal one don t write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind this is a great case that came two weeks earlier than the arrival date in came in good packaging and i found no flaws when inspecting it my jasmine fits snugly inside of it no bumping whenever i carry the case the only problem i have is it smells terrible but that s fine i just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable other than that this was a great investment
1308	awesome strings did what i needed them to do drop a b good tension only con is that ernie ball strings seem to wear out fast and lose tone so for now i m good but in a few weeks i ll need new strings in which case i ll probably go d addario or cobalts still decent strings if you need cheap strings fast the d addario sets are good stuff i got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker the color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran with stretching they stay in tune fine the unknown truth about non nylon strings and maybe even them too is that there are only a handful of string makers and d addario actually makes them for other companies gore uses them for their elixir series and just adds the polyweb coating i also use the ghs standard sets and they are good too my faves are the ernie ball sets but they rarely go on sale i don t remember who makes what strings for what companies though with offshore production a standard thing now it s no telling where they actually come from anyways i doubt that gfs strings are domestic production for instance i bought these thinking they were the normal sized big stubby picks obviously they weren t they re as sturdy as the big ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me i still think amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information but it s still not too bad nice quality fretboard oil has a nice scent to it and remember a little goes a long way i would definitely recommend this worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard i got it today in the mail and i already tried it it s really cheap product but it works really well i m really happy with it and it made me save several minutes to change my strings bought this years ago it was a nice long cable that i bought figuring it d be durable but it didn t last maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig if i was better with wiring i m sure it s fixable but all in all it didn t last as long as i d hoped my band was playing out one night i use an amp stand that was on the stage i really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve it s sound and decided i had to have one i started searching around and found this product the price was right so i took a chance and purchased one sight unseen the musician s gear stand does everything i needed it to it arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble it s light weight portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to lbs i would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier lbs or less
1309	i have had a korg ca tuner for a few years which i really like i wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit initially i bought a boss tu for more money but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the korg tm and the batteries rattled around in their compartment also i like having the middle green led for tuning the price here can t be beat and it s a well built item that works great i was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much but they take more pressure that it would seem and there is a delay until it turns on or off so that turned out not to be an issue i am not real hot for the color but it s nicely made and works well so i will live with it i especially like the little folding stand in the back rather than having to find an old credit card quality strings at a very affordable price they are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product the strings are slightly smaller than the j and deliver a great sound several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound my reply was to purchase a set and give them a try thanks again jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow it hardly generates any dust and gives the bow that extra grab the only problem is that the effect wears off quickly i use it in combination with motrya gold
1310	these aren t my first set i can t count the amount of monster cables i bought and own none has ever failed me so far highly recommend these disappointing was looking for to receiving these but mostly they are unplayable leak air badly easier learning bagpipes than these things save your money and get some harps that actually work decent case though seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website but there is no dealer anywhere near me so i bought one sight unseen from amazon based on the good reviews i m glad to say i can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design a traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction the narrow reverse taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom heavy look when viewed vertically back and sides are cherry with only a light stain and the binding is dark the top is natural cedar as dreadnoughts go this one is very comfortable to play sitting down it appears to be based on the martin outline but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout weight is pleasantly light and the semi gloss finish is comfortable to the touch players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard but those with small hands should consider the slim version with a neck narrower at the nut sound is what really counts however and this canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there the maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high quality fresh strings allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up overall it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category with good volume buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering and the truss rod required adjustment a long reach hex wrench is included if you are not experienced in these tasks a local luthier should do it for no more than or so based on sound playability once adjusted and construction quality this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range it is a real standout in value update dec the more i play this guitar the more i love it it delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought snap and once the action was dialed in the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding i didn t fully realize hindered my playing i am considerng replacing my takamine mini jumbo with a seagull equivalent really am impressed with this gig bag my beloved jasmine fits perfectly inside has nice padding tons of pockets to store stuff backpack straps and handle for easy carrying and it looks fab love the price too can t go wrong with this one i m taking my korg ca which has no backlight slow reset time and a ridiculous stand feature put a business card in the slot in the back and try to find a level surface for it to stand upon and putting it in my sock drawer with my decades old guitar pitch pipe also going in there is my intellitouch tuner which drives me nuts with the arrows and does not fit securely on my fiddle for my fiddle mandolin and guitar i ll use my just received intelli imt which is very compact great for fiddle mando cases which has an outstanding backlight superb accuracy and quick resetting the intelli in its own manufacturers box which has no shock absorbing material was placed in a larger shipping box by the distributor seller the instrument store without any shock absorbing material leaving the intelli a very sensitive electronic metering device subject to vibration and shock during the long trip down the east coast it would be good for amazon to teach sellers the basics of proper packing for shipping it s not rocket science i played the wedding march at my son s outdoor wedding back in april and i needed an amp so folks would be able to hear me i plugged in my martin hd and all went well the martin has an fishman infinity pickup narrow style in it and together with the pickup this amp put out a real sweet sound as i said the wedding was outdoors and everyone complimented me on the wedding march so i know they heard me and i didn t even have to crank up the volume in my den when i practiced i barely raised the volume else it would have been way too loud so in short i d buy it again
1311	a little patients sanding the saddle to fit my vintage guild better fit than the plastic original that it replaced and the sound expanded beyond my expectations i also replaced the bridge pins with tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone i recently acquired a vox valvetronix ad vt combo amp from my local music shop i use this amp mainly in the modern uk preamp setting for most of the music i play when i tried it at the shop it sounded great of course i couldn t go stage level in the shop so i couldn t really get a feel for the sound i took it to practice the next day and was really put off by the floppy sound of the low end when chugging on the low e so i went about experimenting first i converted the combo amp to a closed back speaker cabinet instead of the original vox open back design small improvement but not close enough after couple of weeks i also noticed some volume variations as i played with a little research i found that it is one of the signs of a bad tube i did a little more research on the ax tubes and found that they are not all created equal of course and was looking for one with tighter low end this one came up in the specs of doing just that i believe it was x where i got that info i got the tube this morning put some gloves on an went about switching out the tube yes treat these like halogen bulbs the oil from your skin will create hotspots and damage the tube quickly i pulled out a gt groove tube from the amp i was totally surprised groove tubes were the tubes to have in the late s now a days i read they are rebranded chinese tubes so sad anyway total tone improvement got the bottom end i wanted and i had to make some significant eq adjustments from my original settings and easily nailed the tone i was so looking forward to while the case is made of plastic the construction is solid and seems very durable my disappointment is with the sound i never could dial in a sound that made me feel like it enhanced the sound of my bass it was just different i ve switched to using the built in compressor in my digitech bp instead i had the sn guitar tuner this one the sn is actually for all instruments if i m not mistaken and it works great never fails i love the red the swivel head the green red lights when tuning just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it
1312	best inexpensive right angle cables out there i use these in my lesson room at the music store that i teach at they will last forever if you take care of them i m giving this one stars with the caveat that you must get the silver aluminum one otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break the thermoplastic ones broke on me within months of use different ones until i got the silver one which has not had that problem every music store i go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones and they look in disbelief at me when i say they break but they did if i leave it on the guitar on a fret for or minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea the thing literally snaps and breaks into or pieces and goes airborne at high speed in pieces and could poke someone s eye out in a public performance freaky there s something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and or temperature fluctuation that does it i live in northern california so i don t know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem the silver aluminum one by contrast hasn t broken in now nearly a year of use and shows no hints of doing that it feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic no hint of plastic but it is very light and not heavy like the g ones are i made sure to order the silver aluminum one through amazon since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic and i only want to make sure i get the aluminum one the silver aluminum planet waves capo really is the best capo i ve ever had super easy to use very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you re going from playing one song to another you don t have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it which is a spectacular design it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos and it s out of the way of your hands doesn t interfere when you play any chord the screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn t hurt the fingers when turning it it s the least obtrusive and best capo ever i ll also add that i have an old carpal injury so i want the least strain and small hands so i want the least awkward and most light capo and this does that i absolutely love it and i m glad that the aluminum ones are durable its quality for a small price good if you are looking for a budget wires overall it is good to buy i purchased a couple sets of these to try them out they are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune they seem slower to lock then my snark tuners and the visual scale is not as precise but they do seem to work fairly well the ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars and they can be stored in the case attached its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it update downgrading my rating by star having used four ns microtuners for a couple of weeks on four different instruments i have to say that in comparison to my snark tuners the ns micro tuner is slow to lock and difficult to tune precisely with the snark any of them i have several models i can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds with the ns microtuners i have to repeatedly pluck a string and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment sometimes i have to pluck a string several times before the ns microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all it is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target e would be a perfectly tuned e but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort i still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check but when i want to be precise and fast i always reach for the snark
1313	i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar got tired of losing picks in mid jam digging through pockets scavenging for another pick now it s right there i purchased these to use with my mandolin they are ok i personally prefer a little stiffer pick but my kids have been using them with their uke s so all in all not a bad purchase i ve picked up a few of these for my various guitars i ve found it to be steady and stable and it hasn t left a mark on either my large archtop or my les paul the little locking strap that goes across the neck cradle is a big plus too i ve seen plenty of lesser stands for more money so this one is my first choice these days what can i say about a guitar strap it fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price i have never played a string instrument and it looks like i ll be able to get the hang of this very quickly only problem is the strings sting one play s dead meaning it will not stay in tune not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem have another set of strings better quality and will try that set soon i own a number of guitar hangers this one was a good buy for the money i have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive but also a good deal pricier for what i spent for this one it is adequate as long as it holds up pun intended this is so darn cool it shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune and it works on so many instruments
1314	works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain this pick is great highly recommended i love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding i also i prefer the feel of a flexible pick grip is very good this is my new favorite rock pick i purchased this mic to use for screencasts recording what s happening on my pc s screen while i talk about it i set it up to sit on my desktop approximately away from me and usedcamtasia studio download and a free program called camstudio to test it out both programs worked well with the mic and did what i d hoped it would do eliminated my need for a clunky wired mic headset the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic i love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop s monitor kinks in my system muffled audiothe included software cakewalk s music creator le can be installed on one computer you get days to register it i installed it and registered it immediately but it would not allow me to put in my registration code saying i wasn t the system administrator i am and my windows pc says i am but alas it wouldn t work this software is optional but i decided to install it prior to the microphone per instructions to try it out eventually i ended up uninstalling it soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue muffled audio recording no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it i was stumped then i decided to go to the samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic the generic ones installed were from no luck i began reading online about muffled audio on windows pcs somewhere i noticed a name i recognized realtek which was a name associated with my speakers on my pc realtek digital audio i went to the realtek site and noted updated drivers for windows bit and decided to download and install them i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem i did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording afterwards i tested out the mic using camtasia and camstudio both worked beautifully with the samson go mic on my desk at a distance of about this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts no hiss hum breath noises or distortion very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio works perfectly with the usb connection on my powered usb hub conclusion buy it for great recordingsthis mic is a truly great if it s recognized and properly configured by your system impressively clear recordings unlike any i ve been able to obtain using aplantronics audio usb multimedia headsetor the mic on mymicrosoft lifecam cinema p hd webcam black for the price i don t think you can do better it s compact has great voice pick up and audio recording clarity installation issues may occur but updating audio drivers using a powered usb hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you ve been hoping for at a price that s right update been using this mic consistently for a couple months and i m liking it it s a condenser mic and doesn t filter out ambient noise as well as i d like however for an under forty dollar purchase i m still very happy with it cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it i guess if anything that s been the downside to this purchase
1315	i just bought a tweed blues jr and love the amp it s got a great tone much better than the black one i had yrs ago i just downsized from a watt blues deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side i can say they sound very very similar as they have the same speaker but the bj is much lighter that being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo i was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone didn t do that on my last one this pedal works great for that too it feels very solid and it doesn t make any audible clicking noises that i can hear when engaging it perfect cable for using with my small behringer channel amp to plug into my mic slot on my small mixer high quality and great sound i got mine in a trade for practically nothing i figured i could sell it and make a few bucks saw the mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility looked like a toy to me anyway i decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little inch speaker i researched and found there is a program called fuse that can interface with the amp i downloaded and linked to the amp there i saw you can make a lot of changes that can t be done with just the knobs i saw it had a deluxe reverb setting i have the deluxe reverb reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software to my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my deluxe fender really got close with the modeling i went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between settings i liked it so much i went out and bought the mustang ii i almost like the mustang i better but the ii does have enough power to gig with if you aren t a loud band i will leave my deluxe reverb at home for my next small gig and use the mustang maybe even the little one and mic it up i really like this one as a pre to my fender superchamp x head especially on the distortion channel it really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a huge sweeping circuit i was not able to get it even close to way without it being just ugly but that might be preference also of note is that i ran my fender mustang bass guitar through this active pickups and i loved the grit that it gave the sound this is a great pedal for the and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand very nice work joyo i will be buying more of your pedals for sure
1316	i have a set of the original locking tuners on a ish strat so i decided to try these on a fender telecoustic guitar i have that wouldn t stay in tune these fixed that problem it stays in perfect tune now this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill but this is the switch for that amp never used this seller or site for this purpose before sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks they fit perfectly and i have used them on strat and a levinson blade not forgeting my ibenez easy on time delivery no hassle with either the quality or service this seller is worth supporting thanks with a little sanding this fit my fender american strat perfectly great sound that only a bone nut can produce my strings stay in tune even better with this installed very nice value
1317	tons of useful information on this wheel my only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written seems like reasonably durable construction compact enough to stow it in a guitar case i must have had over tuners in the last few decades and the snark is by far my favorite i change out altered capos every few songs so i have to tweak the tuning many times each gig and this has made it much easier even in noisy clubs with poor lighting if you ve read my review of the much cheaper hohner old standby harmonica key of c you know that i love the special it s great for beginners or experts alike sounds great right out of the box and plays well i was able to bend notes right away with this one while other cheaper harps take a long time or never to break in properly all the notes reeds sounded good if you re serious about playing you will be very happy to have this harmonica around i ve had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite
1318	this is the one that everyone told me i should use being new to guitar i figured one polish car has to work well that was very incorrect on my part this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes i like these pics i use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin good for fast strumming etc they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto i would buy them again i ve been using these for years tried others but i prefer these i d allways come back to d addario s they just sound good i m satisfied makes the strings nice and easy to fly over no buildup or residue on your fingers either i like this stuff this is heavy but strong very comfortable i cannot carry it around with me but it works well at home i recommend it this straplock set doesn t come with any instructions that s because it s so easy you don t need them took the original screws off my fender strat set the button screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in afterwards screwed the lock into mygibson lightning bolt style inch safety guitar strap jet blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was ready it is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock won t come loose by accident by any chance still haven t given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes i can tell i made the right purchase way recommended been playing for years and i have used tube screamers extensively as some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about it is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over dollars are there better tube screamer clones out there probably but for the price you will not find a better unit build sturdy i would gig with this without hesitation i hate to leave this review because i know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products great pedal great value
1319	durable affordable easy to grasp and use it only holds heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to except i did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars these are good don t get me wrong i have tons of picks and these are well made and easy for me to hold in my hand without slipping around too much bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot great quality for the money and works well mic is as described i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn t know the clip didn t come with it so i had to order a clip later nevertheless it has good design to dampen the shocks it is also rubber in construction so it won t crack like the other low quality clips it is a bit big for the cabled mics so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag but for wireless mics it is good i would recommend it i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine it hasn t seen heavy use it wasn t supposed to it sits in a corner of the living room holds the guitar securely and doesn t cause problems although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious and my yo neighbor was convinced for a year that i was drunk and wailing away on the guitar at am at least that s what she told the police this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musician s gear stand they might actually be the same stand under different names the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping if i were to buy a stand again i would still get this one because it s available under prime the other one isn t that gives this stand more value the stand is very easy to set up the lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar this took a little getting used to but it does work very well the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems given the very low price this is an excellent choice for a living room stand if you re on the road or performing you might need something a bit different but i can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself for you can t go wrong its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere this capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument highly recommended just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with i bought this in lieu of the more expensive lee oskar rack i m not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with this rack is constructed better than i had really expected it s easy to adjust however i found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward getting he harmonica unto te spring loaded holder can be a bit tricky still this is a good deal good product but i d expected more robust on your structure but it s good product don t have adhesive to bind on the surface
1320	this is more of a like it or hate kind of item if it doesn t work you hate it if it works there s nothing impressive about a stand so i just like it this is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an key keyboard the front back spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the more common x stand maybe it s because i cut my musical teeth on motown and s rock but i ve always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound or even ground wound strings it might also have something to do with the fact i play upright as well flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright like to my ears it doesn t hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever too i use d daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as i ve found them to be very consistent from set to set and the sealed plastic packaging means that i can buy a set today put it in my case and it s be as good as new a year later i used to use labella flats on my fretless and then switched to thomastik jazz flats then a friend told me he d switched from the thomastiks to these he found them much more consistent in quality and smoother as well i m now a convert too noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price i used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems at this price how can you go wrong comfortable and sturdy works just fine thank you bought another for my strat i have tried many picks in my years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best i have been using dunlop for the most recent years but these are the best the carbon fiber of these dunlop jazz iii make them as long lasting as you want when playing rock slides and picking they are better than any other material and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz their grip is excellent and they feel awesome gotta try them highly recommended cheers this is an intriguing idea for a microphone a nice condenser with built in monitoring a possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal it seemed to me that i should test it both as a microphone and as a usb io device the very first appearance is impressive there s a nicely compartmentalized carrying case inside there s a milled aluminum desk stand a cable a short manual and the microphone no shock mount the mic looks good but has almost no mass while this may not mean much i own and have used lots of mics none of them this lacking in heft i set up a shootout in my studio i have an acoustically treated room with calibrated studio monitors so i think i can do a fair test i kept it simple using a steel string guitar played in several styles for a comparison mic i used an akg perception this is a multipattern mic that s only a little more expensive a cardiod only version is exactly the same price as this mxl i used only the cardiod pattern so i think it s a fair comparison on the basis of price to get to the point the akg beat the mxl in every way it was quieter with a much better midrange a glance at the specs online at mxl shows a significant boost in higher frequencies leading to about a db rise at k or so the polar pattern is shown only in broadband not at multiple frequencies and it shows a dip at the degree position these were things i could easily hear so purely as a microphone the mxl doesn t match up to other mics in its price range but that s not a complete comparison the mxl has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency that s a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses the mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable better make sure you hold still when you use it there s also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level this means that it s easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you re mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level there s also an optional software control panel mac and windows that goes with the mic it provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring i m unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing once done it can t be undone i d apply those after the fact when i ve got plenty of time to dial them in this leaves the level controls a place where mxl could have been more careful there s a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself it takes some doing to figure out which does what there s a highpass filter tremendously useful when rumble is a problem but we don t know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain i hope it s analog but there s nothing about it in the documentation then there s the biggest problem there s a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic s headphone jack but this also means that depending on your daw it s easy to set up a feedback path you won t like that the biggest question in my mind is just who is this microphone for a traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate i have mics both expensive and inexpensive that i ve had for years and years only the preamp interface changes this mxl is usb only only you can t easily set up multiples of usb mics without clocking issues most usb firewire mic preamps have a zero latency monitoring mode so the mic doesn t really offer anything you can t get elsewhere in the end i don t really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians to me that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer if you re a podcaster or a serious skyper then this mic deserves consideration it s a decent mic for spoken voice the hf boost is helpful in bringing out articulation and the single usb connection keeps your desk uncluttered of course there are plenty of other choices for that application but i think that s the best light to shine on this one i ve had a few of these things not all the same model this one was hard to read i changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit overall i like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal i ve been stringing my guitars with d addario for several years while my jazz box is set up with heavy strings my les paul goes lighter horses for courses you might say i ve been using d addario xl strings on this guitar for a while although it s the exl slightly larger bottoms but why not give these lighter strings a try the quality is obviously high tone is good as is durability if you do much complex chording you re going to miss the heavier string but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice i ll be going back to the exl s since i prefer the more positive feel of the larger string but fat or skinny d addario makes some of the best strings out there
1321	i tried this but ended up going back to tortex i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid this is an always on pedal for me it s at the end of my pedal board right before the bbe it really allowed me to wake up the board and i like the fact that i can adjust it on the fly if i don t totally agree with my tone that night very nice built like a brick every guitarist and bassist needs one of these whether you run a pedal board or not i own a fender reverb reissue and i had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very very difficult to find however i bought this jj electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until i had enough money to afford a higher end tube and this blew me away i was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound this was well worth the small amount of money that i paid for it in fact i think i will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it s almost dead before i purchase another tube the quality and feel of this tuner is very good tuning the guitar is really easy just put the batteries in it comes with aaa batteries and press the red button to turn it on then pluck the strings this is my first tuner and its great already it s very portable i m using this in v in a watt tube amp it s really nice i tried the nos route and i much prefer this tube the other good thing is it comes in a box from jj unlike some tubes from other places i ve ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them a bit too soft but given the fact it does say made of suede you should expect it to be super soft better for lighter guitars imo i own alot of mxr pedals and this one is one of my favorites this is one of the top delay pedals the pro s use it is super simple to use regen is how many repeats you want delay is how long you want the delay to be and the mix is basically how loud you want delay to be in your mix you can get all the great delays out of this one pedal from ain t talkin bout love to the randy rhoads solos of the s there is also a little mod button which seems to add some depth to the pedal really makes it seem a bit fuller i like that feature alot i have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard i wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time so i tried this cable and it works perfectly very heavy cord and top quality construction can t beat the price either will buy again i tried this at the store it looks like it would protect a guitar but the latches are kind of large and clumsy the interior was nothing special either i passed
1322	i really didn t expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is it s tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts it s not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap but it serves it s purpose well feels sturdy enough and it s adjustable for a man of any size i ordered it on the th and received it on the rd no complaints here if you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend or on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine for you can t beat it buy one or nothing to lose here i have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig but not enough power for pedals this totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for dc distribution a very nice tone very nice metal sound very crunchy and deep well worth it for the price on par with other way more expensive pedals definetly buy the power supply with it though it just makes it better and easier to use very nice product overall great hook supports a lot of weight looks good on any wall i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application these do definitely have more output i really don t know what else to say about them it s all about personal preference so but if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too oh one thing i can say is that harmonic squeals and harmonics in general are better defined and sustain longer with these
1323	time will tell if they last longer than strings rd the price visually they don t appear any different than cheaper bronze wound strings i was expecting something different but as far as sound goes the strings tuned well and only required some stretching times to get them to stay in tune even after playing smear notes on several songs my problem with cheaper strings de angelo was they would tarnish or rust quickly the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar the company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last to times longer i ll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not since these are literally triple the cost i ll know if it was worth the extra expense hopefully these are made in the usa instead of china like most other things we buy in america good or bad once i see the longevity of this set i ll add to this review at that time it s nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play a lot of songs say capo preferred it helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on i recommend this product i ve purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store mainly due to the low cost they work okay but are difficult to keep in tune the guitars have to be re tuned often when temperature humidity or playing more than ten minutes occurs my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string then the strings go flat sounding these are not quality strings at all just cheap chinese made quality they are okay for someone that doesn t play often but if you play daily or as a performer avoid these strings better strings are worth the extra cost you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings i ve had this problem with all the d addario brand strings both for electric or acoustic or string guitars the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing the tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster so far still made in america i have been using formula guitar polish for over years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal i ve polished many guitars multiple times this gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new it works great on acoustic and electric solid or hollow body acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking it even cleans finger ease lubricants off the neck and strings i haven t needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both
1324	sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a tusq this should improve my sustain and tone even more if you re looking for a budget increase of tone this is a way to go unfortunately these tuners require drilling to fit my squier strat they look very similar but the two pins are approximately th of an inch further out from the shaft so i m going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them worse the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so i m going to have to fill them first the quality of the locking tuners looks great i only wish that they d show a diagram with the specs written on it so that i could have known that these don t fit my guitar installed this on an old aria dreadnough i found in a dumpster cleaned it up buffed the finish out tweaked the truss rod a bit and installed this saddle with new dunlop s and this is one of my prize acoustic s now thanx graphtech i bought this to try out on my baritone uke it works great and is very easy to use i use it with my fender mustang i had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my martin dx i was able to attach it to the smoother hpl back and sides using the suction cup i wet it before attaching you could also use a small clamp blue painters tape etc for trouble mounting it could be used on just about any instrument some may need a clamp it picks up anything it is attached to it will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp pretty cool nice price i like these little guys i m not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price
1325	i love these pedals inexpensive to purchase easy to mod to your liking this pedal received the gain and jcm mod i will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them this pedal is also good stock for a lead boost love this pedal i like mxr products however i am always leary of the metal button on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor the dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive a must for pedal boards these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now it looks nice on our fender blacktop bass plus the locks it completely changed the look of the bass details i purchased this pedal with good expectations however my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged i tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained overall the pedal sounded descent for a pedal but i could not handle the frustration i traded and another joyo for a ibanez stereo chorus
1326	for the money i have no complaints the enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable not true bypass but none of the boss pedals are it doesn t suck tone this pedal isn t the end all be all overdrive but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don t you lose a little low end when it is engaged but that actually works pretty well for leads especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of classic distortion encountered with el s as a stand alone overdrive i prefer other pedals but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp you get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right like any overdrive you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations lately i am running this into either the v cool cat transparent overdrive timmy clone very very nice or the behringer bo which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch jet city combo or palomino combo as with any overdrive this thing will not sound very good imho running into a solid state amp that s just not what it was intended to do it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv because i m a cheapskate and because these things are durable like bricks i bought it used for but it is well worth the new asking price i ve been buying dunlop pick for at least years now and i love the feel and the grip the picks last for a really long time and i would recommend getting several thickness for different applications but for sitting in a room playing around with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac acoustic amp the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy however you do have to use a volt batter to make it operate this is totally unnecessary for a foot switch the worst part is the leads on the battery connector volt were not properly soldered or had shorted out the only way i could get it to function was to let the volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed i e all that has to work are two switches and a battery you would think that boss would put out a better product i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site so based on the reviews from amazon and a friend who swears by these pickups i decided to put one into my taylor i am extremely pleased this was my brother s guitar and he had a mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop it sounded terrible i tried messing with placement to get it to sound better but it just didn t sound good had tons of feedback and just didn t have a good feel i installed this pickup myself i have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars and this one was pretty painless i didn t have to drill out the endpin hole so it only took me about minutes to install this bad boy when i tested it out i was blown away it sounded beautiful just like my taylor only louder the true test was an actual live performance i brought my baggs para acoustic d i and i was glad i did i was able to adjust the eq just a tad cut some of the mid range a bit and it sounded even better i could not believe it it literally gave me chills if you re on the fence about this pickup go for it the reviews don t lie this sounds fantastic especially if you can eq it a bit i did plug in without the padi just to test it and it still sounded good if i forgot my padi i would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system it might be labeled as passive but it s got the volume of an active system for sure it s a great buy in my opinion i also own an olympus ls this gives me the same recording ability but it is much less expensive you do get the ability to record with four channels which i am dying to try once i get my hands on encoding software also nice and not included with other brands a tripod to hold the unit a handle to use the unit like a microphone charger and earbuds some have noted the zoom doesn t have speakers built in if you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it you need monitors or quality headphones i find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments as i said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls this may be a big issue if you don t treat your equipment carefully time will tell but i have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money i am also looking at the zoom h which will come out in sept this product may actually be the ls killer capos are a funny thing there are some that work great and many that aren t so great my capos include bird of paridise paige and kyser this is a very fast and easy capo to use the tension adjustment is fast and easy if you need an all around capo for a six string guitar this is it i ve owned two of these pedals and they both had the same quirk the delay is amazing the repeats trail and decay beautifully the controls give you a wide range of tones but they ve both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me one constant high pitched screeching tone my signal chain was low gain and its done it when it was the only pedal in the chain so it s not another pedals influence i love the sound but i won t use it live in case of feedback that being said its still a very good pedal
1327	when i first got them i thought that they were going to be cheap as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging but it was ok i wasn t expecting much from them the picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material they did not bend at all when i tried to and believe me i tried pick wearing is virtually non existent and i utilize alt picking a lot in my practices i actually learned my first sweep shred d major with these picks within a day of getting them i highly recommend for the shred guitarist my only complaint is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do becuase of the grip but i got used to it rather quickly important you can get these in packs at for only free shipping as well sorry amazon but that is just to good a deal to pass on purchased this to replace the dampit as a no drip alternative with the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use distilled water will extend the life of the sponge overall simple and effective however i may have added too much humidity was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity but i then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case i do use a hydrometer but i don t think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar but only the inside of the case so i think the planet waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it works great i use this thing several times per week in rehearsals and it always does the job my only critique would be in battery life maybe a different setup it uses aaa batteries would provide longer life otherwise it s great these tuners are amazing i like them so much i bought another one they work better than tuners costing ten times as much you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use it it s so simple a child can use it the face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark it is extremely accurate this is so much better than my intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what i paid for the intellitouch it s very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without it uses one cr volt battery and comes with the battery included you have to install the battery which is no big deal just read the instructions i recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too the ns mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi octave range of electric bass guitar and mandolin the accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button the tuner s view window is slightly larger than a chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly lit spaces one thing that s less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself if you ve ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what i mean i d wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing a lighter color may work better the notes appear red when out of tune their color changes to green as a rough marker you then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note they ve gone to lengths to make the tuner stage friendly but i d much prefer the green color mean fine tuned and done that way i can look from a distance i should only have to bother with the bars if i m struggling to home in and in my experience that s the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by new strings slack under the bridge pins a slipping tuner etc mid life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably so long as you don t use a lot of altered tunings the ns is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back i m a lefty and unlike some other tuners i appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right side up the viewer doesn t extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my l with large new yorker style tuners on headstocks with more bare wood like a strat or even my a style mandolin it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn t obstruct my hand while turning keys at first i didn t like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock i could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like i needed two to remove it one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out after a little practice however i found this wasn t the case and the touch required isn t difficult at all the tuner s constructed in a high impact composite similar to those parachute style clamps you see on backpacks it feels durable and very unlikely to break although i didn t try stomping on it i was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag the battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin the tuner has an auto shutoff function to preserve battery life the power and frequency buttons are just nibs really i d prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them the tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from to if doesn t work for you one advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren t limited to usually diatonic open strings for myself i only use tuners to set the pitch of one string usually the low a for guitar or bass and low g for mandolin in my opinion tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics and neither does the job well intonation is subject to a bunch of variables string action and thickness neck relief fret condition nut and bridge condition once i have a single string to pitch i match fretted and open string unisons and octaves after a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument i used to love staring at those pignose sized strob a tuners sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately i wish many more did i m not quite sure how we went from we tune because we care to i m so embarrassed to be standing here tuning i hope no one notices but the ns mini headstock tuner questionable design choices and all does what it says with a minimum of fuss i must first state for the record i hate strap locks hate may be a bit shy of the mark actually i ve never met a set i liked in any single way i ve only ever dropped an instrument that had strap locks on it in fact every instrument i ve owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed even with locktite when you install them you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material leather nylon etc so it is never really tight plus there s only about two threads on the slim little nut and if they aren t a really tight match to the other half wear very quickly especially since you have to tighten them so often duncan type often suffer from non positive lock syndrome if not regularly cleaned and lubed then there s the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons your strap is only compatible with the ones which match and then there is the the metal on metal clankyness yuck oh and and the cost moving on why are these little elliptical end pins so brilliant they are not strap locks if you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them as you should then in order to put your strap on and take it off you will need to turn the strap degrees to the instrument this isn t something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage sometimes the simplest design is the best design and they re pretty too downsides i will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short but then i would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly if they don t using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer especially considering if the screws cut new threads you re pretty much uh screwed the washers these come with are pretty small too so i just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons with a brand new strap they can be a bit tricky to get on but just as tricky to get off which is good that tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap especially if it is made from cheap materials with older straps just as with any traditional strap button you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap but it is very easy to verify and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly but with strap locks if there s a problem you ll have to grab some tools to fix it or replace it entirely talk about a false sense of security with pe s elliptical end pins you just put the strap where it should be and you re set if you are one who is taken to doing back flips or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula hoop onstage then these probably won t save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey s worst intentions but if either of these antics are your norm you might be better served by a permanently attached strap or perhaps therapy since writing the review above i ve ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses i m done with traditional strap buttons and don t imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks
1328	schaller guitar strap locks work really really well however i had problems at first until i made some changes first off you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen the blue stuff will be more than enough second the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn loosen the screw over time kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar so when i install the new button i put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first never had one unscrew again if you do those things first you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident ever but you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock this pedal works but doesn t have the depth of echo i expected i doesn t even come close to the same sound quality of my old dan echo de pedal that certainly explains the difference in price you get what you pay for i m using it with a fender eighty five solid state amp i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same if you re looking for a good slap echo effect i would recommend spending more money and buy the dan echo de pedal or even the danelectro blt slap echo pedal is less expensive than the dan echo but still sounds better than the fab echo pedal the fab echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it it s just not as good as i expected i m sorry i bought it and i don t recommend this pedal there are much better ones on the market shop around i have used fender thin picks for years but always in either solid black or swirl brown these picks are great because when you drop them on stage or in a dark club you can find them easily great little pedal for a very reasonable cost this pedal is durable too cause i have owned it for about two years and it has held up great so just because it is a little cheaper does not mean it is not a good pedal sounds great too soume times you just need a transformer based low amperage power supply for pedal where the switchmode based modern supplies are just too noisy this was the cheapest so it goes i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around this makes a good spare but i would not use it and trust it on stage it is thin leather and doesn t seem like it will hold up under any abusive situation that s just my opinion of it you may not see it like that and have no fear of it i would fear it great pedal get it you wont be disappointed for basic delay needs great tone dont waste your on others with similar specs i m a string rock bass player that has purchased a lot of overdrive and fuzz pedals most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass they typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone are too fizzy and clanky in the top end don t provide enough dynamics or don t provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive this incredible inexpensive box really nails it you get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz all with a great bass tone with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking the downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits the whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an ocd ripoff the frosted side of me loves that i saved a lot of money buying this ripoff i bought this with the idea i was getting a pedal that would give me usable marshall amp sounds after trying for a couple of hours i find that it won t do that i guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn t meant to be used with this pedal the guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control he was spot on about that very annoying effect nothing but praise goes to the supplier kdm distributors they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country but the pedal itself not for me wow i am very surprised by this pedal i got it with the intention of going aft that chimey ac tone which it does a decent job at i didn t realize everything else this pedal can do you can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem metal no problem crystal clear and punchy no problem super crispy tele twang no problem i tried it on bass and was really impressed it is eerily similar in function to my sansamp vt bass pedal and gets a lovely svt type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end i even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added od crunch in front of both my head cab as well as vt bass and para driver works like a charm turn the voice control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy while adding a bit of mid range response i only wish this had a balanced xlr out in addition to the normal out phantom power would be nice then also i would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there i have been thinking of trying the joyo di wit speaker simulation for this purpose but i just haven t gotten around to buying it yet in my opinion you should at least check this thing out i mean its its not a very big capo like it looks in the picture and is sometimes hard to get on sometimes but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done the only problem i have with it is that i get the strings a little bent but that might just be me for the money there isn t a better tuner on the market today this is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really this tuner is s pot on every time and super fast you can move from string to string quick this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product these people posted what seemed like a good price not ridiculously low on the us dream pedal it was to be shipped from japan they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazon com because the item was less than under the next best posted price and these rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn t make a killing on the item i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident
1329	i needed picks so i ordered an assortment i have been trying different ones i seem to like them all i bought this for my year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks she loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics i stuck this on her amp so she would not mis place it this guitar strap performs as expected for it s price great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started or for a backup strap
1330	just assembly for a try only few rolls with music it s had some hole on head that s mean bad quality buyer beware for this kind of it s light and has great sound for interviews i would recomende this mic for any station and we are z net visit us on the web and hear it live this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all cymbals that i possess and use very brilliant and resonant definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price trust this cymbal once and you won t be disappointed it lasts a pretty long while too it s a thin splash so it does tend to break after about months of use er so but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there all in all i definitely recommend trying this product it s a cable it works great i don t see any reason to spend more money on a short cable like this it s working ok not for hard usei just use it on my pc table for karaoke online with phantom mic it s well done
1331	i knew it would be small but i wasn t thinking this small it shore is cute good enough for now but not for the long run shore its loud for the size but it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides from vibration if you keep it on lower sound its fine this is only for temporary use for me its an ok tiny mini little amp for it s size its good don t exspect a fender amp thats all i ordered this pedal based on the previous review but to me it sounds cheap and faint i do a have a few behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one i won t be keeping to me it wasn t even close to as good as what you get on fender amps or on my tc electronics delay pedal which includes chorus vibrato and i thought that i would go solo with this pedal but for me it s a no go i use several behringer components in my set up e g my mixer pa speakers effects accessories etc including this pedal i have confidence in the behringer name and always feel like i m getting a good solid piece of equipment that i can rely on this pedal is no exception it s a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal i don t like to depend on battery power for any critical components if i don t have to so i also purchased the behringer psu sb power supply general purpose dc v power adaptor available on amazon along with this great price sturdily built great compressor effect i ordered this pedal based on the previous reviews but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust i do a have a few behringer pedals and many are very good for the price but this one i won t be keeping to me it wasn t even close to as good as the fender amp reverbs if you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth this is a fantastic amp for you fender has done an amazing job with this amp in this amp you have all of the benefits of tubes warmth at all dynamic levels as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playing the champ circuit forget the fact that you have digital amp models built in too you also have a w champ tube amp with a inch speaker it s not exactly a champ reissue but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any champ out there people who like a great champ tone would pay more than for a great w champ amp add to this digital presets fender gives you digital models through a tube circuit of tweed amps blackface amps hot rod amps as well as metal amps a jazz amp and an acoustic sounding model add to that some preset digital effects including reverb delay vibe trem and chorus each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the digital models are and they are absolutely right but this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a tweed or hot rod tone directly to an authentic champ amp not a model of a champ amp the real deal the implications of this amp are really huge i d love to see fender do the same thing with a pro jr or even a blues jr amp perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp who knows but what i do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character the digital presetsfor me the highlights are the authenticity of the tweed blackface and hot rod tones i really feel like channel sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the inch speaker the tweed tones are syruppy and awesome the blackface clean sounds like a princeton and i even think they were trying to emulate a deluxe reverb on channel as far as volume people ask is it loud enough to gig with sure it can get loud enough over drums etc but i d mic it anyway i get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume mic it and you can play it anywhere the only downsides as much as fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads this amp really doesn t give metalheads that much to work with it would be a great practice amp for any guitarist blues metal jazz or country but the metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs lack of a mid control i m not sure that i understand why you d have an eq with treble and bass with no mid control personally it s the eq knob that i would use the most but if you are switching between digital presets you have to work with the treble and bass to find the sweet spot for your mids to my ears it s not in the same spot on all presets that one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets this amp is cool and unique which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when fender releases the next big new thing line and vox tube digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out fender has found a sweet spot of value quality and usability this is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with years later truly a unique and versatile creation this amp is a ton of fun the presets sound great by themselves but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the fender fuse software it is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike luv it i had version and this amp isnt much different they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software
1332	even though these are folk strings i put them on my year old dread and they sound really good i hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate i also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing so far so good this product is excellent cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue made my little martin look almost as good as new this is the best case ever for the money i have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the gator deluxe i like this case so much i plan to purchase two more this week i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin ny i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar i simply love the cradle from jim dunlop although a little pricey first the material that the neck rests in is very soft overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar won t fall off of that skimpy little legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this planet i did find it to be a little short to support my ovation acoustic bass but a small length of x fixed that second it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which i need to get into the back guts side of my ovation i used it to whenever i am changing guitar strings and whenever i am tuning and intonating my fender strat the surface is perfect no rolling away of screws no scratching of the guitar shiny finish perfect
1333	it does what it says it a kyser quick change capo this capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry highly recommended i knew i did right by buying the dr it s great and stands up to much more expensive of it s kind i have lots of gibsons as well as epiphones and frankly i don t see any difference to speak of if anybody wants a durable acoustic string with fine sound you ll find it in the dr best of luck to allregards roger epiphone dr acoustic guitar string natural i ve found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by schaller and dunlop these look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strap i use them on a prs se and i did not need to do any additional drilling the screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure highly recommended
1334	this has come in handy many times in my studio z net we love having it around good quality affordable price great all around mic used for vocals no frills tough as nails and great sound for live music if you re buying your first mic or switching from a cheapie and intend to use it for singing vocals this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation i ve never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic that came with some bundle years ago i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly you can stand feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in between the sm cn comes with the mic ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip the standard sm does not have a switch one less thing to break and i don t miss it but the sm s does have it for a few dollars extra i had purchased this cord and a cord for an assignment i was going on i had previously bought a shorter cord that just didn t fit tight enough into the mic this one and the other one i bought were really a great well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should i would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you i will get another for my monitor
1335	it is a decent cable it does its job but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth the switch is also loose the connector will move around mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications it would be more suited to home or hobby use not much to say about foam they do the job well you can t go wrong i would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap i have been using this pre amp for a year and it has been great after i figured out that you have to attach a ground cable to the record player it installed very easily just plug it in and it plays i have not noticed any excess heat or other problems even though i keep it inside of my closed entertainment stand i purchased this sometime around september and when i received it i tested it and it seemed to work correctly i ve had no trouble with it that i can remember think of
1336	it s amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electro acoustic guitar it s very useful when you don t want to carry two o three guitars or when you can t buy an acoustic one it s the best i ve been a musician for most of my life playing primarily keyboards recently in the studio and with bands saxophone and a little bass guitar i ve owned a six string guitar for years that has seen very little use i had this misconception that my hands just weren t designed to play guitar but recently my life changed a little bit i have a young boy that s now master of my universe a lot less room to leave musical gadgets lying about and i now live in an apartment building where making a lot of noise tends to be frowned upon i picked up this micro crush because i was originally looking for a micro marshall and i saw this pop up i knew i already liked the sound of orange amps better than marshall given my druthers of musical taste and for it seemed like not much of a reach to try it out for myself shortly after a small package of value came to me with this charmingly tiny amp in it my son s mom thought it was a toy it s so small yes you might think so until you plug it in the idea here is to sound loud without being loud this amp is perfect for that most of the time i have this thing turned up to about rarely up to or beyond i ve got a simple effect chain going in eh soul preacher compressor sustainer mx analog delay cheap but pleasant chinese phaser eh holy grail amp i use this as my clean sound without the overdrive it is beautiful a little dick dale ish then when i want a little edge i turn off the phaser and delay and turn on the overdrive maybe nudge down the volume a little more and i can rock ac dc licks at midnight without raising complaints from the neighbors and it sounds big no this is not the same as actually being loud for one thing your ears won t ring the cops won t come knocking to serve a noise complaint knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves the dogs won t howl but should you desire to rock out at midnight in your apartment building this amp fits the bill so much so that i the man with the hands just not made for guitar now have guitar callouses a lust after a couple k guitars one of which will soon come home with me and frankly a love for playing the guitar that i never had before in my life this all because i can just set up my little rig next to the couch and it s always there always ready to go so i play while i m watching football or baseball i play while i m watching the news i play while i m playing crazy s with my son i play morning noon and night not only that but i m actually getting to be not that bad at playing either lots of playing practice seems to inevitably make on better hint do those finger exercises too they work so i am not exaggerating when i reiterate my headline this little amp changed my life for the better best buy for under i ve made since i bought my son his strider balance bike which is orange too got a vintage instrument you don t ever want to see hitting the floor well here are is the long term secure solution this is a nice strap it feels really durable i like the black side and the soft leather side it feels good around my shoulders
1337	my son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass jazz band and his standup bass chamber orchestra it is solid yet flexible in height and angle assembly was a breeze this is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use built like a tank should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family there is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these i have several came in perfect working condition great buy for its hard to say anything bad about this gadget it s accurate in any sound environment easy to read in any light very portable and will tune any stringed instrument the visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that s a silly extra that doesn t interfere with anything so no problem
1338	got mine for under and it s a great mic i can use it for vocal tracks or recording for webcasts that kind of thing or recording studio guitar sounds etc awesome mic what a great multipurpose guitar tool it works great i really like the fact that it is cutter a winder and a pin remover all in one the quality is really nice next time i place an order i m going to get another one as a spare i d be lost without this tool it s a good product works well and does what it s meant to do i m glad i bought it over the other main pop filter as that one has bad reviews these headphones are wonderful to wear they sound great but that s not enough now a days with the head band being connected to the outside of the muff they fit your head so wide the pioneer hdj has the look read my review on those though they are terrible at first glance these things are serious pro grade they are made of very durable components both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head the head band isn t bad it s a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued not really a big concern though they have a long cord and i ll talk more about it later it ends with a spin on in or a standard mm the sound out of these things is pristine it s not muddy and very clear they have a good amount of bass because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don t leak noise like a lot of headphones do pros heavy duty awesome sound comfortable headband over ear design not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag always clear never muddy even at high volumes very clear left and right ear markings spin on plugcons heavy coil cord heavy weight never got annoying though looks
1339	i bought these to go from my board to the amp we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating they are still going strong sounds and feels nice i have an entry level guitar a peavey rockmaster it came with entry level strings these strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument be advised the low e string is thick when i try to depress the th fret i can t get it to register as a hit with rocksmith unless i press hard with my middle or index finger well sometimes the pinky is needed to do that plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game other than being a little cheaply built it works great i like the fold up into a small package idea room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands i can put this over the shoulder carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip this was my first foray into home recording and it comes with audacityfor free free is free and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction the interface is noisy and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc sent it back after one day
1340	i m a professional musician and love these cables they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables i ve been using quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any ernie ball products great very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces i have them on several bass cabinets they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use these are pretty good quality tweed cables i prefer the tweed they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs they also make one with the degree inch input as well i was not sure about this at first seemed too cheap to work but i was happily surprised it works welll not perfect but not expensive get one
1341	the product feels a little on the cheap side but definitely does the job the way it should so that s all i care about it was cheap and came fast i recommend it i ordered this product to use for personal recording and thought what could possibly go wrong i ordered it new and it definitely shows signs that it not new first the package was stapled that s right stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened then to make matters worse there is a hole in one side of the fabric when i order something new i expect it to be new based on this product alone i would not recommend buying from this seller review updated after more time spent with the mic well there s definitely some detail missing in the mids but it has a generally pleasing very fat aka muddy tone makes a fair snare drum mic needs a bit of eq for almost any practical application i don t think i d use it to track the vocals on anything but it works you d be better off with a similarly priced small diaphragm condenser and a windscreen cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use still highly recommended for the money i was not expecting the onstage tripod boom microphone stand to be this good the bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced the main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust it is built like a baton the arm is adjustable and long i usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm it can hold quite a bit of weight i haven t tried it yet but it holds two of headsets and mymxl multi pattern studio micwith ease the adjustable arm also spins degrees smooth movement when i need to move my attached microphone around it is a smooth leveled motion i love this microphone stand it stands tall and can telescope up to about feet tall very high quality microphone stand buy with confidence
1342	not as bright as i would like them however very nice i can practice without lighting up the whole house i m glad that i bought it i ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price this unit is of high quality though
1343	well constructed with quality woods saddle nut and bracing neck and frets are straight level and do not snag this guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play the strings may be too high or too light or whatever just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well do not buy a luna davidson main street or any other no name get this one ernie ball acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life my playing sucks sounds better with these strings bright and warm at the same time great tone easy on the fingers while i don t have a ton of experience with pedals i really love this one keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain although this is a tube overdrive i actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp it is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what i was looking for a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity for the price i don t see how you can beat this pedal i also have a digitech jam man and it is awesome no complaints with this outfit these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non locking tuners i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners they are certainly worth having fenders at least american made ones are very easy to swap out tuners for these the holes are already there there s no need to drill holes for screws everything is so easy you have to do it yourself i ve swapped out the tuners and have never looked back the only question is what to do with the non locking fender tuners i have now needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget i have owned multiple behringer products and trust the brand it is a plastic casing but i don t tour so that won t be a problem i needed the effect and it gives it fully adjustable for depth tone warble and volume don t spend on a boutique pedal get this one they do the job and are made well i guess the high dollar cables are better but it s hard to tell the difference if you have a trem system on your guitar these bullet ends really do transfer tone energy through the trem block for sustain i added a big block and these strings and it has really brought my strat to life highly recommended these picks sound great very durable and grip is the best i have used my main complaint is the very small size i haven t got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick i find the dava master control more to my liking for most things but i still use the jazz iii s from time to time when i just want a simple clean pick tone was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my year slept before i was plugging in headphones to my amp head but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up take out electric plug covers get all cords out of the cabinets etc oh how life changes with a baby this little product is the perfect solution it takes two aaa batteries some generic brand are included in the package there are two on settings regular on and fx on regular on is basically like a standard lead channel turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch nothing heavy metal but a nice crisp crunch fx on turns on a little delay effect you can not adjust the delay effect only turn it on or off there are also knobs for volume and tone plug your headphones into the side and you can also plug in an mp player on the top to jam with a backing track vox has samples for all of their amplugs on their website however they seem to be missing samples for the joe satriani version i would say that the js version is pretty close to the lead amplug i have a pair of middle lower range headphones audio technica ath m professional studio monitor closed back dynamic stereo headphones and the amplug sounds fantastic in the title i wrote wait for this to go on sale b c of the js branding this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs however it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled personally at the higher msrp i dont think its worth it but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone open cap rub across strings a few times basically you re done if you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over that works well too doesn t leave the strings oily or full of residue i will probably clean my guitar strings every time i play now this little thing is just what i needed for my acoustics my amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now i have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up the read out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by red is wayyy off yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune great for a quick look in between songs highly recommended not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no name japanese knock off i play mostly hard rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech metal and prog rock for solo projects where i m playing pretty fast and sometimes hard they also handle de tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like dadaad they are clear with good sustain great feel to them and nice sounding they do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what i normally use i think i will try these in the super slinky
1344	don t even hesitate buying this thing it s everything you need it s a pop filter it clamps on to anything that isn t over about an inch and a half in thickness it gets the job done buy it this was exactly what i needed for the price range i could afford in a crunch my old mic just wasn t cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles it is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals it is recording my guitar beautifully i ve even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar i ve set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole slightly back and sing into the top at about degrees and back a little i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean i m very happy with this unit price considered but i d have to pay a lot more to improved on it i ll probably get another one i kind of wish i d have bought that combo kit this saved med at least instead of getting a traditional pre amp best invention ever also portable downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but i keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff
1345	i had to make some adjustments on the neck of my martin d and remove the bridge pickup this left the saddle too low to the neck i researched the tusq products and found enough people impressed to give it a try i m pleased to say i find more ring through the body and a better sustain i ll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on haven t used it yet but it looks nice and came quicker than expected so far so good i recommend it nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn t work well that s not the case here this power supply is well made durable and performs to the specs supplied i guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration but why go to all that trouble this product lives up to it s calling besides who wants to keep changing batteries in the stobe tuner planet waves when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget i gave it a star rating because the price is fair the product is well made and works and it was shipped well within the promised time by today s standards that s as good as it gets dp
1346	works great with my baritone ukulele same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo easily fits in my ukulele case too this little gem is worth it s weight in gold so easy to tune with it we have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong automatic shut off helps too aloha friends simply put if you have a ukulele then these are the picks that you should be using cheers i recently purchased this ukulele from a local guitar center when i first got there i was looking at the lanikai brand but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that i felt like a strong wind could tear it apart then i saw this one it has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range i have already learned the basic chords and can t wait to become proficient with this instrument best strings for my ukulele these are great quality i only use aquila strings on my instruments highly recommended my ukulele has a better tone with these strings
1347	great rack mount screws rubber washers are perfect lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon i use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile dj equipment and they have held strong i am very disappointed the guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body it is unusable until repaired update it has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller amazon and have not received any communication don t like that it s difficult to change the tube sound quality was not what i expected maybe because i wasn t familiar with the settings no power cord was included in mine or manual manual should have been include not sure about the cord dials are very small my mic and mic are much better than this i can t say it s bad just that there are better choices in my opinion i have purchased various lengths of these gls cable to patch my rack equipment they are well made reliable and cost effective the xlr connectors are secure and i couldn t purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less the colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone it now rest at bottom of a box this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain
1348	this product works well but i still end up doing it the old fashion way guess i am not a gimmick person i purchased the planet waves ft instrument cable for our son to hook up his electric guitar to his amplifier it works well no connectivity issues whatsoever highly recommend bought this to power all my stomp boxes wha peddle tuner etc works just fine in fact bought a nd one that stays on my workbench for powering various items being tested or worked on has all the adapters i needed
1349	this microphone is the best microphone i have ever owned it is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality it is very clear sounding and very well built get this mic you will not regret it white thin picks by fender what else can i say they are very good looking the only downside with thin picks is that you tend to keep buying thin picks because they keep breaking because you are playing fast and wild with them as cheap as these strings were i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved i picked up an old cheap electric guitar that needed some work it had been dropped on it s head after repairing and playing it it still sounded like crap so i had these strings they were cheap and i put them on only took about minutes to restring and was well worth the effort okay the guitar and i am too embarrassed to give the brand isn t my gibson les paul or my fender american strat but damn it sounds good now if i didn t have so many guitars i might keep this one but i will probably sell it to make room for another these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them honestly i won t restring my fender with them i ll use the fender bullets but these are great for about any electric with guitars crappy strings kill it great strings can make a bad guitar okay not great i will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars as soon as put it on my guitar i enjoyed the way it got the job done my first concern was will this damage my guitar the answer is no it is user friendly and guitar friendly the price is so low you should own at least one no problems just music at the most competitive price available i would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician they use a heavy metal casing that appears durable and the cord is decent enough for live sound but a very slight hum was present with my guitar harp amp i would pay this price for just the element it is truly a great buy and i would use it for armature work any day i use it for harp harmonica and it works great and it sounds smooth with vocals too i would recommend it to any friend and i already have worth every penny great deal on a capo it s about the same quality as one i would buy for x the amount elsewhere it takes a while for the shipping but that s stated in the description i was pleasantly suprised i would recommend this capo
1350	normal pickguard screws nothing special here you do get a nice amount for the money though so this is still a good if not great deal good to buy for stocking up with just don t expect anything special because of the fender name if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize i love this it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona california with the classic fender name scribed wonderful i have these on all three of my fenders again these should really come standard on all american strats if you have an acoustic electric uke this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends beach road trip camping etc it s quite small and easy to pack into a backpack or bag it s not a great electric amp but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke use a volt when you need it or buy a v ac adapter to plug into an outlet you can t find a better option on a budget when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile quality sound i bought one of those padded fender leather straps it says fs canadian leather on the back i thought these fender strap locks would complement the strap but because of the padding the thread on the strap lock wasn t high enough for the nut to reach i finally got the nut to get a hold of the top of the thread and although it works i don t trust that its enough if you have a padded leather strap i don t recommend these at first i wanted to get these to replace the cheap springs to came in my mim stratocaster for it was the last thing i needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo after installing these tremolo springs which by the way have a nice flexible tension i notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved i did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like to enhance tone and sustain on stratocasters so at this is definitely a win
1351	these came on my american tele in and i ve been buying them ever since sweet action durable and very affordable i used this on my last stratocaster build it arrived quickly and was well packaged it is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard be aware the cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back i was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit these already come with foil so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase i ve had no problem with this guitar stand i ve had it for about month s now and when i m not playing my fender strat it is on this stand i recommend it as a well functioning stand at a very economical price these tuners look and feel great i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build it was kind of a pain having to drill the holes for the prongs on each tuner but that is the way it is designed they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part it isn t completely black though there is a white stripe running around the outer edge not a problem for me but it may be for some
1352	this is a good product its not the best strap but for what i paid for it its well worth it ive had it for about a month and so far it seems to be holding up very well this is a great product for a beginer works great as a stand for the elec guitar work good in corners and i like it for starting out learning these are good picks and produce a great tone they re better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers this may be watts but it can fill a big room with its sound not too heavy and very handy for traveling this can t be used for concert or gigs but for use in private family use or maybe inside a church built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient for the money there isn t a better tuner on the market today this is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker really this tuner is s pot on every time and super fast you can move from string to string quick
1353	i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar got tired of losing picks in mid jam digging through pockets scavenging for another pick now it s right there this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars i love its size and portability piece of plastic with no bracing due to design will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf which is most quality stands i used double sided sticky tape problem solved gives me a place to stow my guitar picks tuner capo and pencil and as such is an invaluable accessory worth the bucks just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick they are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold i can play all night without dropping it this tuner work well one of the features is that when its not on one of the notes the full screen is red so it easy to quickly tune up i haven t picked up a guitar in years but this was a long winter and i needed something to occupy my time i broke out my strat and discovered that the amp was dead mice had eaten the wiring crap so online to see what defined state of the art this is it if you need a basic practice amp that with a decent laptop and internet connection can help you produce any sound with a few simple instructions this is it no foot pedals or expensive add ons until you really have to have them just pure creative sound that won t break the bank buy this amp there s just no way i m going to give five stars to a piece of rubber that s what this is it doesn t even look quite as good as the picture largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up without those picks it s just black molded flab the damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful i bought this on a whim and cringed when i opened up the box but for the last two weeks it s been propping my takemine up against a coffee table the rubber is thick enough and non skid enough that it keeps the guitar in place effortlessly it may not be much to look at but it works really well the top portion that rests on a table surface is about inch think there s a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place that s about inch thick the cost of materials is probably not more than cents but it s the design that sells this thing if you can find this for less at a local shop go for it i paid amazon even at that i consider it a good buy cool little digital tuner that works great on my ukulele small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners i like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance highly recommended
1354	i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic which i was pretty happy with for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn t have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems and i was right i put a pair of d addario xl highly recommended for those players who can t decide between s or s and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently don t let the higher price on these strings entice you go with a good set of d addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long lasting strings this is as light as you want to go on a lp scale length about the same tension as s on a strat so don t want s and s too tight then s it is nice strings i wasn t expecting much for the price but have to admit i m very pleased with the tone these strings produce straight out of the package after several hours of play and tunings they re spot on and sound sweet as cream butter great product and very highly recommend rugged pedal by a little known company took a shot in the dark hit a bullseye great univibeish old chorus device would like to see stereo output options in future models solid if you have a strat have studied jimi then it will suit you well if you ve got the right physical approach to the guitar itself i ve found no issues with noise or build quality so far the foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their input outputs in weird places
1355	when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it there on the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use very good strings its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting squire fender guitar in terms of e to e string spacing the low e string out of range and not fit in the hole i got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail saves some money on replacements i found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so i like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings i use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning
1356	if you are looking for a sustain pedal this is it built solid feels like it could withstand a good beating which is good since my teen is using it not complaints just works and is reasonably priced this is a good neck rack for gigging it does take a little tweaking and customizing to get it arranged right around your neck but that goes for all neck racks really once it s fit to you though it works beautifully i use mine daily and it hasn t failed me yet also it will with a little ingenuity hold a kazoo slide whistle and or humanaphone i e nose flute i do a one man band act sometimes first let me say im using this for a bass at least for this review and nothing else that said i lovebehringer products that i own this guy was really cheap and actually the chorus part is weak as comparedwith other chorus i have such as art zoom peavey line gibson or we could say in a more positive phrase very subtle the stereo effect for me was non existant but realize i bought this item over buying a normalaby switch doing so saved me a bundle but in the long run i will pay for it there is a high cycle hum in the background which almost all chorus units end up having but i can say it did the job as far as splitting a signal into amplifierheads and doesnt seem to have a problem with the signal being delivered note if you plan on using a volt dc adapteryou have laying around in yer gear scrap bucket think again wont work i tried different volt dc adapters to no avail all that said i still gota give the item its due negatives the unit is made out of plastic and you will have to take it easy when engaging on off i had to take mine apart becausethe chorus wouldnt trigger on it was due to the fact it just has a small strip of rubber that is supposed to engage with the buttonswitch on the electronics board you may have to put something behind it or replace it i only bought with the idea that a full version of behringer s sequence program came with it needless to says its a compact version and for you other imac os x users out there aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on vst s au s that will work with osx and cubase or garageband other than that its another interface i guess as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that with who the uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pc windows owner i would get it its about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to daw dat interface mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macs imacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably kripes man the one time i go and actually buy a honer and its a bummer this thing has keys off tune i can buy stuff times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk maybe it s a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i m really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b all i can say is buy merana s for tryin out buy suzuki or swan from ebay overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you ll be better off oh btw hot tip for poor guys again you can get a mississipi river harp for only oo if you have a burke s outlet near you they re up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho the doctah has spoken
1357	behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging i just didn t want to spend on the boss version but you get what you pay for another thing that i hate is it s really hard to change the battery unlike the boss pedals save your money and steer clear of this one i also bought a behringer power amp for that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out excellent pedal i love this chorus it is perfect to me the effect is really great mxr has a very good quality it works ok if you are used to using a volume pedal i had a hard time making small volume changes while singing i decided to return it it is well made so if you like volume pedals it s probably one of the best i have also owned the moreley lil alligator volume pedal it has a mimimum volume knob which allows more subtle changes between rhythm and lead volumes the dunlop does not have that feature you really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone i was able to sort of dial in a nice marshall s alt rock sound but when you re not playing it can have a noisy wind like feedback coming from your amp but it can vary from amp to amp you can fiddle with the voice and drive knobs to clear it up but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound but to be perfectly honest it s pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than i like this power supply but i wish that the led s only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to so for that reason i ll give it stars as opposed to the quantity of power outlets and the amperage s that it provides are best in class
1358	made of durable nylon with pick pocket given stars shipped on time and at good price i recommend this item went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case too expensive went to amazon found a great case great price and free stand it wasn t terrible for someone who was a beginner with electric guitars and amp but after a while it becomes less and less useful
1359	i ve had this pedal for a number of years it provides a wide range of reverb effects sounds natural and has a killer stereo output i ve haven t heard a pedal that competes with spring reverb but this pedal keeps up with any simulated reverb pedal i ve heard and does an excellent job with amps that lack a spring unit the effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well recommended these headphones are amazing they are absolutely fantastic for the price the only problem i face is that they hurt my head from the pressure of wearing them but i just need to stretch them out little to say about this incredible little stomp box no color on your sound build like a tank large display perfect for those smelly and dark bars and joints where all musicians play and it has korg brand printed and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner cheers this is the greatest practice amp ever and by practice i mean practicing by yourself and with a band first it s all tube so it sounds really good it s gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes it also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast second it s watts and is pretty darn loud i ve used it for band practice and it s definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer at a bar you ll probably need to mic it or use the included line out third if the speaker isn t loud enough you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air it sounds great in the x and x cabs i have that ll make it loud enough for most bars fourth it has great sounding built in effects nearly everything you ll need most small tube amps don t have built in effects so if you re trying to practice down in the living room you re forced to drag your effects with you that s annoying with this amp everything is built in fifth unlike a lot of tube amps this one gets very quiet you can turn it way down keep the warm tone and practice without bothering anyone else sixth the price is amazing all tube build in effects and line and speaker out wow fender is basically giving these things away i love this amp so much i want to buy one for every guitarist i know the only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch but considering the price that s understandable there s no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them you ll only want the cover and footswitch if you re playing in a band
1360	i play my i pod through a small guitar amp great way to wake up the kids works perfectly for the purpose keep in mind small end for i pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else and works well for it my only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal i don t know how long it will last i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole but the price is right and the stand is solid enough all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last liked the sound the adjustability just wish i could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way i find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid i don t care about disturbing the neighbours but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling the rumble is a bit big to take everywhere i made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must i use it with home recording and it is great for my needs i recommend this to anyone who records at home wow this tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio it gets used daily if you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this get it they won t be disappointed unless they tune below drop d the strap looks great very cool design and looks good on my tele and all for bucks w prime shipping so why only stars this is my fourth strap purchase from planet waves i have grown to love planet waves straps for their comfort and durability and obviously the designs i thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design mainly because at my local music shops i have never seen felt a planet waves strap that was not made out of their usual thick soft and durable material whatever that might be that i have grown to love this strap is very thin and brittle feeling which makes it very uncomfortable to use this strap does slide easily on your shirt which is what i prefer but once it makes contact with your neck it is sharp and it makes your neck sore and itchy needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on ouch i have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in but it is still as sharp as it was out of the package maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up that is if it lasts that long overall what you need to know is that this strap is not the same as the other planet waves straps the material is very thin and brittle feeling unlike the many other straps from planet waves if comfort is not important to you then get this strap the price can t be beat and will give your guitar that s look if i would have paid on this strap i would be furious but at only this strap is still a steal works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation it s a decent dj announcer mic or for a pa but i wouldn t record anything like singing or music and expect great sound has that great heavy mic feel but is definitely no shure mic despite the similarities it s a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like i also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me very nice cable but the white ends which are nice looking could be a little shorter it works awesomely and it s not a bad price for name brand cables despite its iflavor it works beautifully with my pc sounds better than any sound card i ve used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency it s a great intro model not just for ipads whole device is powered and runs over one usb cord i m so impressed my main pc audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device it s an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with reaper
1361	this thing plays great action is low but does not buzz very easy to chord i highly recomend this guitar works like it is suppose to good quality i am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song thank you kyser capos i reshape my own pics on my grinder and use nothing but heavy picks there are just guitar picks they are what you order i fix mine up by adding stair tread floor stuff so they don t slip out of my hand
1362	this little box will give it to you i personally play bass and i have a thing for long effect chains i count in my little arsenal with fuzz distorions auto wah a compressor octaver bass booster and a nice di box the mxr eq helps me a great deal to recuperate definition and clarity after this long effect chains that i love a great little box so if you are looking for clarity definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the mxr eq will do the trick cheers i bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my fender x champ it has much more weight to it and a way larger heavier magnet it has way more bass and is louder than the stock fender it sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby this one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings great replacement and a definite upgrade makes the champ a super champ i love this boost pedal so much i owned the mxr micro amp for a while but i found that it colored my tone way too much too much low end the mc on the other hand doesn t color your tone at all it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords if you re in the market for a boost or a buffer i d look no further this pedal is affordable sturdy and sounds absolutely amazing not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no name japanese knock off i play mostly hard rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech metal and prog rock for solo projects where i m playing pretty fast and sometimes hard they also handle de tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like dadaad they are clear with good sustain
1363	not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings they are the equivalent ofernie ball slinkys yellow they play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble non touring musician s opinion also it s nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer as a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the eb sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or dr sets that come two to a sleeve in summary if you re searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren t reading this review you re out experimenting for others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more i bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with he really likes it a lot it keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely i read a lot of positive reviews on the s and after some use i am kind of disappointed construction they are just like any other strings just lighter gaugepackaging it arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionprice at new with free day shipping this is a no brainer conclusion i initially liked the feel of these strings but the more i played the more i realized that it didnt have the tone i was looking for i am used to s and s and though they are more difficult to bend with they sound much fuller i put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with s come with all cables needed solid and very much worth the money im very happy with this purchase no regrets at all i used this on my last stratocaster build it arrived quickly and was well packaged it is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard be aware the cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back i was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit these already come with foil so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase i have an abundance of strat parts so when a vintage non strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench i plunked these on the pots the customer liked them so much he kept them on now what to do with these other knobs i bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since awesome feel sound and price just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that i do i know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my strat one thing i notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others i have tried thats nice wonderful to use as soon as i put the batteries in and started even without reading the directions easy as i mentioned in my review about guitar polish already forgot what kind i m not really a guitar polish connoisseur but this makes my fingerboards feel real good it got rid of that scratchy feeling when i bent strings dissolved the crud and makes the fretboard look just lovely it probably works as a fine hand conditioner too but who can say again because i m rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing this bottle will also last me years this polish works well for what i need it for i am not a clean freak but i take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there i ve been using a very cheap amp for too long and decided to try a tube amp this thing gave me chills the first time i played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after i unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first you wasted our money on this which turned to dang this thing sounds good guess it s ok with me as i begin to shred on it with my p equipped les paul the tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic and for watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue though i don t think it is loud enough for a drummer it has line out and speaker out which is great and this amp has nice build quality plus it s on sale right now so snatch one before they re all gone i would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device note that this thing takes about seconds to warm up so you can t just flip it on and play instantly not a huge deal just turn it on before you get situated i wish they could have crammed a inch speaker in it though the inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient so stop thinking about it and just go buy it these tuners look and feel great i used them on a warmouth neck that i purchased for my strat build it was kind of a pain having to drill the holes for the prongs on each tuner but that is the way it is designed they would be a suitable replacement for fender tuners should one ever break the gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar promptly received nicely packaged with protective film on it little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up but overall a very nice part compliments my b w b pickgaurd nicely open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes normally found i am proud to have this product fits my fender well looks amazing great quality in it also i am pleased i have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic there are tons of settings and the leds are nice and bright for dark stages or bright outdoor venues highly recommended good cutter for guitar strings and will take care of most electrical wire sizes too handel is very comfortable too
1364	my axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing years i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i didn t care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith i picked up the lp special in black at guitar center for and they kicked in free strings bought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer tone my lp studio had it s pickups replaced with the zakk wylde s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price you literally cannot find a better guitar for than the special sound two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic not sure which they have so much sustain for a bolt on neck i was shocked build quality i did have problem with the high e tuner i didn t notice in the store but the string peg was up out of the headstock when i discovered this i loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way intonation required no adjustment action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow the finish was perfect no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed damn good for a bolt on hardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very well back bending headstock and x orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it no pickguard and it doesn t need one lots of relief between strings and body you won t find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick makes it easy to clean too truss rod is behind a nice body color plate frets were smooth rounded and played nice could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasn t an issue k pots and side body trplug keeps the cable out of the way overall came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other guitar summary this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box it s well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music the frets are medium jumbo s and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re fretting than a typical affinity or bullet squiers in this price range i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music i did blues metal country and pop the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldn t fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil i ended up putting the screws back in i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in hell yeah coil tapping here i come and move my emg s in this lp special and make myself a nice little metal guitar do yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar it s cheap enough that you won t care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years i always keep these around during string changes i prefer the bass version to this if you can find it these are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar i would rather concentrate on making music why fight your guitar i was using the standard version of these i saw these at amazon and figured i d give them a try these cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables i was using however the ends seem much more well belt doesn t make a difference in the sound i don t know but i am satisfied with this purchase never has watts sounded so loud and clear never think it only hadan inch speaker just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices light weight easy to carry
1365	this pick holder is awesome it just snaps on to your mic stand add picks and start rockin it holds the picks securely so if you re performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away its working great but it does not work in stereo it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive very accurate when i wanted a g i got a g i have such a refined ear that i only have this around if i have a head cold or you know don t want to show off but it s a good tuner the tuning is accurate the lcd screen is clearly visible it works great i m not sure about battery life i haven t gotten there yet saw this sucker on my bass player s head and got one a few days later not pitch perfect on the fly but keeps you very close when on the run unbeatable value silent tuning so on stage it s almost a must
1366	very comfortable bench it s wider than most which makes is more comfortable to use it feels heavy duty and stays still during use do you like to shift your booty around on the seat you can t with this it s too narrow at inches i am going with a wider one other than that is seems decent updated march th i ordered the on stage kt and have had it for several weeks now i am much happier with it and it is easier to adjust the first one i ordered was defective and i had to send it back butt now i am good to go nice wide lip sturdy appears to be well made and durable nice finish on it hopefully will last a long time
1367	bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well product is as described and fits mic perfect will buy more in future it does what s it s suppose to do holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get works very well i am a professional touring and recording artist omeb who typically sings through a beta i have recently been very impressed with some of behringer s products sometimes i will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one at i figured i could chance it i used this in place of my beta at a recent show the mic was much hotter than the better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies as far as durability that is the question but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn t cost bucks this is your mic nice microphone stand for the cost sturdy adjustable good construction it works we like it will purchase an extender to use with it this string set offers typical d addario quality and value i use d addario strings on all my guitars mandos and my ancient old fiddle great cord for the money works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for christmas will buy more in future
1368	i use different kinds of picks this one is very special the strings rings out really pleasant and great for speed picking too for macs but fyi it goes out after mn and just need to be unplugged and back in not a big deal good picks but not a replacement for jazz that i still prefer over this one nice backup in case you run out it cuts down the buzz left by the other pedals for that price it s pretty good not badly built either the effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while i just couldn t live with it
1369	i wanted the version of this device with the built in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar maybe i should just change the guitar pitch to my off pitch singing and i could finally achieve perfect harmony i like everything about it especially i think it s ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life a well designed device i used a felt pick that was made in the s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable i bought a set of mahalo felt picks and while they seem nice they re too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and i get a raspy harsh tone when picking single strings i know many people love these felt picks but i ve found a set of soft rubber picks here on amazon that give me a tone that s much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick i wan t sure i would like this thing when i ordered it but it was cheap enough to try i don t like using it as much as i thought i would but that s just me the device works as advertised over a long period of use i think it might leave a mark on the sound hole even though the hook is padded you can t go wrong with aquila amazing song very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too long lasting made with quality improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a dollar uke sound like a dollar uke this stand is small compact and sturdy it holds my tenor uke just fine and when folded fits into the pocket of my uke case it s perfect to take along to a gig or practice and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down
1370	i have played listened to and used audio amps for over decades and while i haven t owned every name brand amp on the planet i do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when i see one this is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar with an input for a mic xlr no phantom power and a cd player or other audio source it also has a headphone output inch it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs i got this originally for my mother who used to sing in an andrews sisters type group back in the day she still loves to sing and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam she hasn t had the opportunity to do that yet but i have tested the amp and put it through its paces i think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind the lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback but considering what i paid for it i can t complain now this is not a gigging amp at least not in my opinion your mileage may vary it is small solid state with an inch speaker and watts of power i haven t measured the exact output so i m taking behringer s word on that i like behringer and they can turn out some pretty good gear within its limits i like the sound of the amp with my carvin acoustic guitar with a fishman preamp it is an inexpensive practice amp so i don t expect the same kind of quality i would from a more serious combo amp the inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good inch no matter what the question is does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work composition or just moderate entertainment value for me that answer is a clear yes however this is an inexpensive practice amp and if you approach it with that attitude i think you will find it a nice little amp don t plan on using it for your next tour with manhattan transfer seal or celine dion i did some research on capos and decided to give planet waves a try i previously had one of those bungie cord like capos which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome the other capos i looked into were kyser and schubb kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip it s disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune the schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck the problem with the schubb however is that it can t really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar in comes the planet waves it has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard however because of the adjustable tension you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness it might rule out the one handed ease but it does take care of schubb s problem of falling off in reality i only found that i need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if i move up way up the fretboard between the st and th fret i don t really need adjust however if for some reason i want to capo at the th i do need to adjust the tension because it s too tight in all it s not that big a deal and it s nice to have the option to adjust the capo in all i m happy no capo is perfect you can do partial capos with this one another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension in case you aren t aware this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars i have an electric guitar a nylon and a recording king ros with a chunky neck works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ros with that chunky neck since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard it does not work on classical guitars or anything with a flat fretboard the capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved it will not apply pressure on the middle strings it s a nice capo but it may not be what you re looking for so i recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos
1371	i bought these to go from my board to the amp we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating they are still going strong wow wow i can t believe it working wonderful i m using it karaoke online in paltalk i did compairation with somes i have it s perfect vocal i connected it with mixer alesis input i wish it s built with switch on offrecomend to buyer thanks amazon for the multi guitar owners i think this is great all i was looking for something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tone volume changes set up single coil and another line humbucker or p guitar and have the same volumes excellent and space saver sure there s a lot more options but not likely ill use just to make guitar switching easy good deal great price but very fragile i m a year radio pro always careful about my cables the end separated from the cable not very good quality would not buy this brand again i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the mm headphone jack into my pc the audio adapter is well built it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a mm jack installation was flawless windows bit installed drivers immediately no issues no nonsense simply works
1372	i originally purchased these strings because of the gauges i wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around upon installing these strings i can t really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge but maybe it s too small to notice with the naked eye i m not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old daddario strings that they replaced they might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new the guitar that i m using them on is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice and smooth overall i m satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings but i don t think i m ready to give up daddarios yet i love the strings so far just put them on my jasmine by takamine guitar today and they sound amazing very bright tone i will be using d addario strings from now on very pleased with them this is my second fender polish cloth they are basic but that s all i need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after i m done playing the only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges even though this has happened to me it didn t keep me from buying the second one the fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me it gets softer with time and use overall i have to say that i m satisfied with the fender polish cloth i ve relied on this stuff for years and it has yet to let me down i play my guitars quite frequently and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat etc during a show a couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self with zero degradation to the finish i ve even used this on matte or light finishes with good results tip a little goes a long way i play every week i use this stuff every time i put away a guitar and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle i figure this stuff costs me about cents per month
1373	the strap is adjustable on both ends and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder i cut it off and glued the material back together with shoe goo and now it s great padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring i ve read where people are using bottle caps instead of these my guitar is more valuable to me than that i suppose because i m not trusting that my expensive gitty won t hit the floor i mean you pay for a quality instrument right why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe i m sorry but that s just idiocy in action this isn t get an upgrade already i play standing up of the time so these are a necessity i have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily but all except one snapped right back together when i first started playing i had a brand new to me guitar hit the floor and the neck break because i didn t use them that s something that should only happen once in your life if at all the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones they were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well these are nice strap locks but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose this can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut otherwise these are a good value with easy on off the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small good for people who don t have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument i recomend it good thing i didn t trust the plastic anchors i put a bit of weight on it the screws came out of the anchors the anchors stayed in the wall i found a stud it works looks fine good inexpensive guitar hangers i m getting a few more
1374	so far the ones i have used have all threaded nicely into our u rack there are exactly as described and do the job what more can a guy say about a little box of screws maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action i use this with my small mobile dj setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer simple to use works great no hum or buzz at all solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise whoever said behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear our radio station owns several pieces along with this unit and are expanding our gear with more purchases of behringer gear super value perfect cable for using with my small behringer channel amp to plug into my mic slot on my small mixer high quality and great sound
1375	this dunlop ergo pickholder is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar this is a great way to always have picks handy especially if you drop one while playing here are my observations small size is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar easy to attach just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed good capacity easily holds picksmy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid recommendedcfh on stage xcg tubular guitar stand with velveteen padding and security is very helpful tool for any guitarist i got a lot of them for my guitar collection and have no complain recommend it i purchased the l pack picks for my son who just started playing the guitar as in all beginners they want the best and he loves the color and design
1376	these cables are very good the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight that is the pin diameter is perfect there s also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice this thing has so many uses its ridiculous i mostly use it to record live band rehearsals and it s pretty amazing at that i ve also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a usb interface for my daw when my other interface went kaput if you are using this for film music field recording you will be very happy easy to use interface and very well constructed
1377	will this replace a pro fret job nah that said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth end results bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick he loved them still has some this gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal it s go from light overdrives on channel to heavy drives on boost channel with mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound on the other side you can t use boost channel without drive channel as a disclaimer i am not a big muff connoisseur i ve never owned one before this i also tend not to like fuzz as an effect i d characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz maintaining enough definition for chord work if you re reading the reviews you ve probably already done your research on the features but i ll cover them anyway three simple controls volume tone sustain with the sustain control being more or less a gain control the enclosure is a smaller pedalboard friendly size the pedal incorporates two of the supposedly most popular big muff mods with switches tone and wicker when tone is switched off the tone control and its tone shaping circuitry are completely disconnected in this mode the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly and it also produces a significant volume boost the tone knob does nothing when wicker is switched on it removes three high frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original big muff circuit to smooth out the sound disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher with a high end frequency boost i use this pedal running into a mild overdrive the catalinbread dirty little secret which conditions the signal i play with the tone off and wicker on and even with the volume and sustain controls set fairly low this combination results in a wonderfully thick massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth if you re looking to get a big muff and you re not a snob about which version the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound not to mention that at this price point it will be much cheaper than some vintage muffs highly recommended
1378	i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan clear purple ones instead i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk and the item pictured is nylon i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise also the pedal just started oscillating a few times i would have given the behringer us five stars if it kept working it tracked nice and didn t tone suck too bad i like the dan electrode but i noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect turned my heavy metal into a sick fuzz and my lavabox into a primitive distortion and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustain onerr overdrive or volume frenchtoast and thats it it s still a good volt power supply but the voltage drop feature doesn t always wow you i have owned almost every octave harmonizer pitch shifter on the market for what this tiny dollar box is capable of you cant beat it first off its polyphonic you wont find that in anything else under instant tracking wide range of versatility perfect volume balancing and very solid design only two flaws a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals still doesnt hum as bad as my pog did the only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam great job mooer i cant wait to try more of your stuff
1379	i usually play my jazz bass fingerstyle but there are songs where i prefer a pick especially when i need speed and accuracy until i found the hard wedgie rubber pick i used a heavy fender pick but didn t like the sharp pick sound very much i bought a set of soft medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i m really happy with the results i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie s really nice for my jazz bass i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars but the wedgie s are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments i prefer the mm wedgie picks since the mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes but that s entirely subjective i d love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday but it still works very well for me first time for a soft wedgie pick that is i did have an older brother i used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great very good price and looks like they will last awhile i highly recommend they for you to try if you don t like they you can give a fellow musian a soft wedgie which they just may like the ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear it s built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time i ve had it since i normally power it with a wall wart i don t have much of an opinion about battery life bottom line it costs a bit more than the standard dunlop wah pedals it s worth it i used a felt pick that was made in the s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable i bought a set of mahalo felt picks and while they seem nice they re too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and i get a raspy harsh tone when picking single strings i know many people love these felt picks but i ve found a set of soft rubber picks here on amazon that give me a tone that s much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick this capo works just fine the only downside is the same as with most capos it requires some fine tuning to get it work on different guitars the only one i ve found that doesn t is the kyser my go to capo for years because of its design that capo adjusts to any guitar acoustic vs electric thin neck vs thick etc easily the only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of use this capo has a similar pinch design spring loaded but doesn t adjust as easily to different guitar neck sizes it has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs this allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation but at the expense of ease of use it s certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming but it s not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songs so all said i still prefer my kyser it allows for much faster changing which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy but this might be a better option if you re in a studio or won t ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time or don t plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place at about twice the price of their standard strings these d addario nyxl strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability higher breaking point and something called fusion twist which i swear is a rare chubby checker b side having just put a set of these on one of my guitars i can t speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings but i can say they are solid dependable strings with lots of punch and crunch
1380	i ve played string instruments for the better part of years starting with a cheap tijuana wood box as a year old progressing to martin and string acoustic guitars and a few electric fender and gibson units all good in their own respect i decided to treat myself to a les paul for my th birthday but not having the financial resources to buy a git i shopped and shopped finally settling on this cherry burst lp it arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding it was even sorta in tune but a quick dial in with the electronic tuner brought that right simply put nice guitar after allowing the strings and neck to settle in together i spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height intonation and pick up distances and now this lp rocks if you re going to spend mid range on a fine practice performance guitar you can t go wrong with this one kids two thumbs up suggestion a fender mustang or amp makes this guitar sound even better good basic strap it s not fancy but it doesn t need to be by being just plain black it tends not to detract from the good looks of the five string bass it s used on decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar other than that they appear ok nothing to rave about i am pleased with this guitar strap and feel it will do great for the young musician in our home i used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer it really makes the guitar stand out it was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it i recommend this product works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time this package of picks is of good colors and good weight they seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff i use this item for my daughter size guitar its looks light in weight and firm and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars
1381	the most annoying thing about modern ideas in ukulele strings or indeed in guitar strings is to wind them with aluminum wire making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands or at worst cognitive damage skin contact with them these rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound but are silver plate wound no health problems possible from strings makes them the best these items though well made and strong are sized rather differently to national picks with the national i need a large so i ordered large in this item it is however very tight smaller in fact than a national medium thumb pick essentially a waste of money this hand full of picks saves your fingernails they are not the best but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size i am used to if you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track these will not help much that being said these are not junk nor are they cheap nasty instruments there are plenty available that are much worse than these straight from the case these don t bend well but do not despair having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days about eight hours of playing so far i have persuaded the g a bb and c to bend enough to satisfy curiosity but they will not hold up to serious playing i do not destroy my harps easily so am not the most aggressive player out there but i felt like these would certainly be something even i may wear out pretty quickly for the purpose i intended these to perform they are about perfect with me breaking them in i can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics better use these inexpensive harps to over blow and squawk through than the set i will be buying in six months if the promise of musical ability follows through the advantage of the plastic comb is that i don t need to pass on any germs with them they wash very easily with no damage for the price you get seven good harps that make presentable learner instruments with just a little prep without the experienced blues player to break them in it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them there are many youtube videos that will teach the method so try hard persevere and you will crack it with these harps try learning bending on the lower key instruments first they will be easier this is a great value for a practice and travel instrument i got mine with free shipping built like an instrument not a toy it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele fun to play easy to take along stays in tune well enough and it s only a hundred bucks i bet if you bought one you would like it this amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers and name on an old card and give guitar picks at the same time the edges are a little rough but it is a punch not a precision cutter one of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed this is the first harmonica i ever used i did some research and ended up with the special in the key of c i have no basis for comparison and i am a beginner but this instrument sounds awesome the construction is perfect and the included case is very appreciated for i can t complain
1382	works well for my needs it adjusts and holds whatever microphone i use in position very well a good buy i would recommend it for light to moderate use this switch goes with the fender blues jr iii series of tube amps the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill but this is the switch for that amp well hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one i bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs and it is a nightmaregoing on a week now no support help from either company heed my warning if you want to use this with ni ez drummer or other programs like that you must know how to reroute mapping of midi in order to use it this is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software there is very little helpful info out on the net i ve owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item there really is no midi support im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back alesis could have made this an amazing item and times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software i bough this amp for my year old son who is learning guitar for his christmas present i thought that since i love fender guitars and since he has a mini squier we d like to get something in the fender family i seriously expected a cheap imitation of a line spider with a fender logo slapped on it i should have had more faith in fender i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp the amp models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool i have ever used the amps don t sound digital or processed they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain you would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it i can t get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe they sound so full and strong my biggest compliment of the mustang is that it is the only modeling amp that has great sounding vintage tones line has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones vox has never really made great modeling stuff digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc this amp is for you there is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for modern metal but metalheads might be better off with the line stuff the other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls by looking at the controls you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound you don t need to dive levels deep into an lcd screen in order to make great sounding tweaks but if you like to go deep you ll love the fender fuse software it is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound the fact that fender not only included fuse with this amp but also the ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything is just frosting on the cake i am a father of who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing with the added features of a headphone jack and an aux in i can play whenever i want i am actually selling my nice tube amp and using the mustang as my only amp for now and i feel like i am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all the value of this amp is amazing people will shell out x as much for a line modeler but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the fender tones
1383	i owned this pedal for many years before finally trading it in on some other equipment it produces one sound extremely well but it only does that one thing the sound it does very well is the late s early s fuzz sound white room black curtains satisfaction ina gadda da vida note this pedal produces very good sustain but has really bad attack as such it will not really do the whole lotta love sound as i said it does one thing very well but its range even with classic rock is quite limited if you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound this pedal gets you of that sound if you want to also cover other classic rock you re gonna need at least one more overdrive distortion effect the vt vintage tube monster has quite quickly become my go to overdrive pedal surpassing other od pedals i ve used including the digitech bad monkey the ibanez ts tubescreamer the boss sd super overdrive and remarkably the fulltone fulldrive mosfet the vt has several things going for it tweakable eq high mid low which allows you to run a full spectrum from muddy dirty low od sounds even from a single coil to bright screaming lead tones with high mids or highs noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to squeeze the tone for some interesting effects wide range gain that gets dirty around o clock and full on distortion when crankednow for full disclosure sake i did change out the tube to a jj tesla ax but most people who know tubes will tell you that really tubes are often hit or miss simply on account of them being analog heater based elements that s part of the fun of tube based od i have played a vt that had a great sounding overdrive but mine didn t have that sound until i put in a new tube try it out with the stock tube and go to a different tube if you don t like it at least try a new tube before giving up there are two things that i don t like about the vt and i can tell you both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone this pedal got it right with tone after a tube switch the issues are the housing is huge and if you look inside it seems like a waste of space there s a lot of open space with nothing there and while i can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat it s a bit overboard compared to the fulldrive the lack of a boost switch is really a miss especially given the large enclosure it would make perfect sense to move the knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side that d take little effort and given the independent power of this pedal would be a piece of cake to achieve heck i could probably do it myself but i don t want to ruin the good sound this produces bottom line i understand that on a pedalboard real estate is everything this takes up at least the space of pedals is it worth it to me it is i run od pedals on my row board and i can honestly say in the last gigs i have never gone to the other od it s been the vintage tube monster every time i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived just to find out it wasn t working it is defective and because i brought it to mexico now i can t get a refund or a replacement i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something very dissapointing
1384	this is your basic black electric guitar cable but it works great so far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great nice and rubbery and feet is long enough if problems arise later with this cable i will update this review but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable these d addario medium acoustic guitar strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point the strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our auto tuner and have held up well highly recommendedcfh this strap works well looks good and is comfortable to wear the choice of colors and durable material are two strengths price was good for a useful accessory case arrived in great condition quite roomy fits my vendetta and or my les paul two exterior pockets for tools extras etc x thicker padding than the epiphone gig bag i got for the lp but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away i m not hauling them to shows get one i recently bought this for my first electric guitar and i thoroughly enjoy it it has a lot of power and noise behind it it is a little starter amp just in case the picture was a little deceiving i cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion with distortion it sounds great it is a solid piece of work and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp
1385	this pedal has a solid feel under my foot and gives me the push back i expect when playing live gigs always welcomed is the fact is stays in place where i put it on both wood or carpeted surfaces thank u behringer your pedals really kick ass this one is outstanding and for the price can not get a better deal highly recommended well behringer have to say that the electronics are german mind with all that says go figure it out for yourself other then that plastic so i give stars cuz of the soft plastic case and the trouble of changing batteries but u can use the charger and u will be well off sound is really awesome for the money and it is high standard delay time and sound i don t think u can get the german quality anywhere else for bucks i say buy it it is a great delay pedal and not only the delay most all behringer effects are sounding great for the money can not go wrong they said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you re playing up to three octaves but i could never get that feature to work properly from video reviews i ve heard on youtube this harmonizer does not even come close to the boss version but it costs about less since i am not a professional musician and i am just playing around with it it works just fine and you get what you pay for addendum i ve now owned this for a while and discovered that it can turn my six string strat into a bass by turning the balance knob all the way to the right and my pitch on the second from bottom position in fact when i record my dean edge bass onto the boss loop station and then record my strat on top of it using the behringer ultra shifter harmonist i cannot tell any difference in tonality i am thinking of selling my bass it has just become a needless expense needs the neck adjusted twice a year the strings are expensive and it is harder to play then my strat this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer it works as expected and has proven to be durable i don t hesitate to drop it in my gig bag knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show i ve been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy this was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine no regrets on the buy at all this is a hit or miss product for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well it s not a total loss since i can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution i ended up with it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on i bought this in to record music classes and workshops that i take in both acoustic fingerstyle guitar as well as electric guitar bass and percussion all of those environments are very different and require different approaches otherwise you ll wind up with only mumbling or with the sound blown out the dr mkii has worked well for over classes recorded this unit has been great for picking up the human voice about feet away while it has been sitting on an extra tilted music stand with it set to auto level then i can take it to a loud percussion class or electric band class and it quickly adjusts itself to the environment you can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually i ve needed to do that for classes that involved a lot of lectures but then bursts of high sound i was willing to let the bursts clip so that i didn t miss the human speaking around them one little feature that i now love is the fact that you can preset the file names and it uses them followed by a number to create next file i set them for certain venues that take classes or even a class name if i know that i m going to be taking only that class for a few weeks this makes it easy to copy to my pc and keep organized it does the job it s bulky but it works well it comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets or to use the tablet while still in the case i wasn t expecting much from this case i bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that i had also order off amazon that was of better quality then i had expected this case is sweet i love the black and crome it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth if you need a case don t even think twice about this is a great one at a great price
1386	the cable is good and normal good price and works well the rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and i have to push them in place all too often decent holds stands and maybe a few extra poles the bag s shape from side view is a rectangle compare to other stand bags that s more of a square zipper seems to be very good quality the bag is not padded at all and the material used is very thin there is however a water resistant coating on the interior of the bag i think i should have spend extra and got the on stage padded stand bag but if you are going for local shows and doesn t need the extra padding for air travel this is the bag to go i first bought the yamaha mg c mixer but it arrived defective so i returned and bought this instead first impression of profx is very good it s a lot more durable heavy than the mg c and the knobs are constructed much better for example all the knobs that have centering dent on mg c doesn t line up well some are off by a few degrees but on this profx every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm really like the eq on the main output as well as mute on every channel build in fx effects are okay you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anything when using usb to do recording with audacity there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording regardless if microphone channel is turned off or not microphone preamp is so so i guess i have a akg d and sm with both mics i have to turn gain and channel volume to to get a decent output but it does the function perfectly runs a little bit on the hot side power cable is kinda short so you may want to look for a longer one
1387	got mine for under and it s a great mic i can use it for vocal tracks or recording for webcasts that kind of thing or recording studio guitar sounds etc awesome mic these strings sound amazing they also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing i get better harmonics with these strings as well i really like these strings because i have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast i can play a guitar once and leave it there for weeks and the strings will be rusty and nasty when i return to it i now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them but this stil happens then i happened across these elixir nanowebs they are great i no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly and they stay rust and gunk free for weeks of regular playing however i did encounter one strange thing while playing at a rehearsal my e string just popped and broke hurting my finger a bit i was surprised because outwardly the string didn t look that bad so that is the downside with regular strings you can tell the string is near the end of its life b c it looks really bad with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking made me a little cautious i still prefer these over other strings though these just sound great huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner ibanez electric guitar good stuff will certainly come back for more when the time comes cheap for what you get and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but eventually decided to try one out given that a they are making them at very reasonable prices and b i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle this mixing board didn t look that impressive to me when i first checked it out but having set it up and used it it operates very well and cleanly the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus the fact that it does not have an on off switch is a minus but basically it works well the eq is useful and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer behringer makes a range of models with less more inputs to suit one s needs so this is great also having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether you have to turn it down to zero and there are no faders except the main instead it uses knobs for everything well i would have liked some of these things but then i would have to pay more and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far by the way i am running the following through the mixer an at audiotechnica condenser mic an alesis qs guitar via line in or mic d two krk rp studio monitors presonus firebox everything s been working and sounding great thus far the effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me since i am running logic but if i ever use it live which i may do i d imagine they d come in handy the effects are just so so in terms of sounds usable but not that great in my opinion i own the behringer xenyx fx which is essentially this model but costs about dollars more for the fx it comes with set effects i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic using a presonus firebox audio interface with both midi vocals and instruments and didn t use a mixing board but

the effects are just so so
1388	as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal i completely agree with that and it will sustain your notes it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate i use the ns when i use my chain of pedals that said this pedals has some wonderful uses every note will have the same volume you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume you can set it to sustain for days again you will need a noise gate there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as active as this one perhaps that s the price you pay for what this pedal can do i recommend messing with it quite a while you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it good strings for my electric guitar i liked the product a lotclean sound easy to change and much more this pick is so good to play electric guitar it is heavy and small what gave us attack make the sound clean and bright don t let the system absorbs you this device as others is really great for the money check everything by yourself this is as good as other devices that cost times more i love snark tuners this not being the first one i bought nor the last i loved the fact that i didn t have to press all the buttons like the other ones just get it relatively in tune by ear then this thing will help you with the rest my only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip it has already pulled up and i only put it on and off my guitar maybe times so far i mean i ve had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad i m just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe
1389	i had the ones that came with my strat which i believe are schaller s i like the security of the schaller s better because even if the pin is pulled they aren t going to let your guitar loose however my problem with the schaller is that it would always unscrew the neck screw i had to tighten it after every other use and let me tell you not a little loose but a lot loose with the ernie balls there was no redrilling which is needed with strap lock and the eb s screw is good and long you also don t have to put them together like the strap lock which is a bit of a pain these have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern i d have rated stars if the plastic you push together to insert and release was knurled that would make it easier to grab and use these will now be my default locks the quality of the nickel is very good too this is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board i like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking i find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle i don t use it much with single coils since they don t seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone built solid a quality pedal that should hold up well works fine it is of course difficult to tune when other s are playing around you i found the mic tuner isn t as accurate also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily it is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too i was a little nervous for some reason when i started watching this i saw it in the theatre i was afraid i might be in for another live aid let down or something like that i had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened but had no idea if this would be as good as all that never fear you need to see this film the guys prove that the hype was legit i was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like for your life even if the performances of dazed and confused and stairway seemed a little pedestrian but hey it s lz doing stairway which is better than of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance the show seems to get better as it goes along and by the time kashmir comes on i had tears in my eyes no joke this show is riveting i bought the blu ray so i could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show which really defies description i am not sure if non lz fans can appreciate how incredible this show is or what the band accomplished in doing this they took it seriously and rehearsed for weeks for this one event jason bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the s if you love lz you probably already have this set if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one night only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era it s pretty awesome
1390	my wife myself are a celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed we considered a wireless to use with a battery powered crate taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet at these events no power is available when i saw this at the price offered and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered i thought it was worth a try in the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn t hear the stories in the songs we use this to give our voices a small unobvious boost it kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood the result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show laughing at the comedy crying at the tragedy our tips cd sales have gone way up is it high fidelity quite simply no but in our case it works beautifully recommended just remember the price point and you won t be disappointed i have been using an old elastic bar capo for years because the last spring capo i used did not have nearly enough tension when i first applied the planet waves tri action capo i thought here we go again there was ample tension e g but b and e were buzzy as all get out not expecting much i adjusted the tension it took a couple of tries to get it just right but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar zero buzz across the board that in and of itself makes this capo a five in my book add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze on and off it looks nice i have the black version as well as its comparative ease on the wallet and this capo is a rock solid five star product this capo also has a pick holder the feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo s overall size and shape but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself get this capo i ve been using slinky regular nickels for over years on my electrics and love them i ve tried various coated strings etc but always come back to ernie for sound and value but on my acoustics it s been d addario j s since day one and still is never had one bad set out of over a hundred i adore the sound and the reliability so why have i never tried their e git strings because the slinkys are perfect but i must say so are these i just put a set of s on one of my strats and they are as snappy yet not too bright as i could want they really complement the single coil tones especially the and out of phase positions so if you re a strat fan and love that tone give these a shot one thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are a few inches longer than most electric strings in fact no idea why but if you have huge posts and like mega wraps here s your puppy i only do a triple wrap max so it s just more to cut but hardly an issue and no matter what the coated string fans say those might stay clean longer but that brand new string zing only lasts a few hours on any string coated or not so if you re recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones or playing big gigs where tone is everything i say stick with uncoated strings and aside from slinkys these are the best i ve played these are some bright strings i play with a pick and mostly stay in the realm of rock n roll so no comments on the slapping and popping claims the packaging makes but there are plenty of great rock tones to be found heck crank the amp and dig in with a pick and these would be great strings for any motorhead covers you re planning on playing good bright steel tone not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips or frets as rotosounds and they re only a jackson not a bad string i am primarily an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago a gibson les paul what i am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars most name brand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others a few are actually a notch above the others these nyxls from d addario are definitely in that notch above category i find them easier to play better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others i have tried i plan to stick with them a few comments about each area playability these nyxls bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting left hand than do most of the others of course i have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore these strings seem less cutting even after a couple of hours of constant playing they also squeak less when i slide up and down the neck sound the sound is crisp and rich at the same time most electric guitarists who i know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly i prefer a blend of both just as i do for my acoustic instruments these nyxls provide the closest blend that i have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics andtuning tuning and re tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction even some really good sounding strings don t hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone these nyxls are holding the tuning far better than the others i have used less time tuning more good time playing all in all i found no flaw in these strings there is always something new coming along and d addario s formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference until someone comes up with something better i expect to stick with them well made by elixir and developed with taylor guitars these strings were designed for the new rosewood series guitars that came out this year the promise is a bolder high end fuller low end i am a long time taylor owner and favor their series rosewood spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods i have almost always used elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze lights on my guitars i like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings i have never had any issues with elixir nanowebs i recently picked up an ce first edition fret such a fine instrument and it came with the elixir hd s took some getting used to as far as feel due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings e b g but as far as sound they are great the d a low e strings are no different from the regular elixir pb lights so i am not sure about the claim of fuller low end compared to what unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response i am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than taylor s but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings that is what i notice most from the hd s compared to the regular i still find no fault with the regular elixir nanaweb pb s but will most likely continue to run the hd s on my fret i may also try them on my older ce just to see if there is any difference improvement so far i find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain try them out and make your own decision
1391	forget all the volume drop comments there isn t any and it does not color your tone one bit i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in i wanted something to dress up slow ballads and of course born on the bayou this pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on i play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it we have my grandpa s really old mandolin now so my dad and i wanted a nice case for our year old mandolin i saw this case and thought that maybe it would work well it works just fine the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there i have checked this amp out twice once with an orange ppc and once with the version with both a strat and a les paul and i am very disappointed in this amp now admittedly with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones so without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing bottom line unless you want full on distortion of the time you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp if you are committed to orange and boy do they make some stunning amps go check out the dark terror i had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed this compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack it never sounds thumpy or unnatural but always musical i really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like
1392	sound great last much longer than any other string i have tried worth the extra give them a try simple compact well constructed easy to use and sounds good all things you would look for in a capo this is the original shubb capo designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings the shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make each with their own specialized use the c is probably the most universal of all the models this fits a les paul traditional gibson les paul traditional plus electric guitar heritage cherry sunburst aprs se custom guitar grey black with tremolo bridge andepiphone lp special ii les paul collection electric guitar vintage sunburstelectrics the primary use is for a laguna acoustic follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension it s key to not get too much tension we ve had trouble figuring out where to park this capo mostly it goes in a pocket once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck it doesn t clamp tight on the headstock not a huge deal but a consideration i d been shopping for a music stand at local music stores all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are plus tax this item including shipping cost me only about here from amazon and the seller musician s friend sent it promptly got it within business days without any problems i had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions the bolts aren t as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand but i don t care about that it s not hard to adjust and most of the time i have it at a certain height so no need to fiddle with it but during a group performance it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother if you re someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height it s no big deal other than that it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should for price off retail excellent i m completely satisfied with this great deal for the price works fine but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric did the job for what i needed now i know i would love a better one like a fishman easy accurate and best of all it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing i ve tried other brands and they don t swivel correctly
1393	i like these pure nickel strings nice tone work well on my stratocaster with fender locking tuners great combo even with ghost bends slides and pounding with drop d and open g tuning great highs and lows but rough on the fingertips and difficult doing barre chords slides and single string progressions ok with more effort arrived quick these are good replacements or upgrades work much better then the other style of string trees i would recommend this i never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my american standard strat what interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before these are easy to install and simple to use all you need is a mm socket and your are set as others have pointed out these are staggered so there are long ones and short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way it only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove i ve read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but i don t even notice the difference they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected
1394	i was using a kyser capo until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn t hold all the strings down i thought i d try something else out and settled on this one it s easy to take on and off it s tight enough the main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so i think it will fit even the widest fretboards i don t know about a or string though these cables are perfect the quality of this cables are incredible and the sound is excellent i really love monster cables it s cheap light simple and does its job not sure what else you could want out of it i m more than happy with it but just don t know what else to add it simply works bought two of them about a year ago and i m still happy with them they do what they are meant to do no complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them
1395	good cheap mic cover fits es ok could be a bit tighter i suppose anyway it only needs to keep goobies from getting in my mic great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic great price very happy and shipped from amazon perfectly with great packing i am running big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is watts but runs a pair of peak super pro inch speakers and a pair of road gear subs so far i get a big punch aout of it i tough i had to buy two of this but one works fine i am running a dj karaoke system i also got a pyle pro channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable item received looks diferent i say better really great quality item it was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up it s durable and i suspect will last me for the rest of my days this is a very well built stand even with its slim design which also comes with a nice carrying case very good for light portable set ups also holds a big mic if you position the legs right completely open with the mic parallel to a leg that said do it wrong and plunk will not likely stand up to a gusty wind so use it indoors only paid for it would give it stars but i know user error will cause a less careful person to crash some mics good for kick drum and cab mics by the way anchor it down with a sand bag if using it for this purpose
1396	i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar i would have given this item stars but even fully extended it is about too short as for the quality of the strap i love the look and feel of the leather it has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer my cents in summary i think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric this strap would work much better if you have a larger sized guitar find a longer strap fast delivery works perfectly i have of the danelectro effects pedals hard to say which i prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound i m partial to the chorus good item this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods my only complaint is that i wish it had just a little more height adjustment maybe inch overall it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it upon close inspection the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe wall so don t expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off even if it is welded better than mine was just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs it is literally that thin of metal tubing for i did not expect perfection so to it s credit it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars this stand does have one other good quality it is cheap since it was less that i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it i was able to carefully weld mine back together but this would probably not be an option for most the stand might work fine if you don t fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up but if you need portability and durability i would definitely purchase a better quality stand i ordered this primarily for my string ovation bass first there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings my ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but i was finally got it on the bottom between the d g string tuners it does not respond well to an open b but octaves are fine and as long as i have confidence in my intonation it is no problem i tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on when i tried it on my ibanz solid body string i found it to be even less likely to read quickly or at all also worked great on my strings joyo makes great quality products cheap i love this product it works great all my pedals hove there own power supply
1397	this was very easy to put together top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable love it perfect size and does it s job had one pick inside as a place holder stick tape holds it anywhere you want it cheap and easy strong and won t tip price is very affordable i own several and have had no trouble with them buy it and you will see this little stand serves so many purposes for me at home it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when i want to test out different pedal configurations at my gig it holds my presonus mixer a laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers it is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide and short or tall as well i have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it i plan on using this one day to hold my ableton live machine as well as a small octave keyboard and i will use the mic boom arm at that point even as a keyboard stand i like it because i can put pedals underneath it with it fully extended to long mode i can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it of course that is solid inches of stage front though which is indeed a lot for the small places i fit into with my duo i ve tried many types of chairs sitting on my computer char etc but it was always awkward this bench with its thick padding and wide width allows me to practice playing the guitar and move around freely honestly i even sat on the floor for a while but no matter what i did my legs would hurt i just wasn t at the right height this bench is adjustable and i was able to find a height so that i could practice for hours without putting a strain on my legs and back it was absolutely worth the small investment for me i have many heavy guitars yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers i m neither however my back was still hurting and i m definitely a weakling so i bought this shoulder pad now i only look like a weakling to the more eagle eyed people who see me play guitar thanks planet waves really though it s quite good i was at guitar center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased ibanez ew asent acoustic guitar which is virtually identical to theibanez ew zwent exotic woods series zebrawood acoustic electric cutaway guitar but everything they had in stock was a bit too small i ve been playing electric for many years but this was my first acoustic purchase turns out i have the dreadnought variety which is a bit larger this fender bag received some great reviews but i was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren t correct i couldn t find any info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag so i took the leap and i m so glad i did bag is not too snug not too loose and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps great padding yet still lightweight and a great price and it arrived a day early sweet ibanez ew body not neck dimensions w d l thank you amazon fender
1398	i am disabled a disabled vietnam vet and my mobility is becoming more limited every winter my wife bought me this for christmas thinking i needed a new hobby to keep me busy during the harsh winter months i am so happy she did my first thought was now i have to learn how to play this thing i am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with i now own guitars and have even built custom guitars i always get carried away with new projects and can already play quite well or so i m told i practice a lot now about the guitar i wanted to wait until i knew a little something before i reviewed it first i don t know how they sell these for the price they do it is a very high quality piece comparable to guitars in the thousand dollar price range the action is nice and low good especially for a beginner i did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference i use light d addaro strings and love the tone and feel the yamaha is solid wood everywhere no laminate as you d expect for this price the tone is fantastic the finish is flawless and tough it sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it i have been strumming vigorously for over four months now and not a mark is on the guitar i have been playing many other guitars all electric as well and am looking at a high end acoustic now but will always keep my first there is no reason for me to need another acoustic i just will because i can this yamaha has great tuners and stays in tune well rarely having to make an adjustment once the strings are stretched the neck is nice though a bit thick so i cheat sometimes with my thumb on the low e the set up was perfect with this and i just can t see where it s going to take much if any maintenance over the years other than replacing strings as needed the yamaha came with a great hard case tuner pics and other goodies as a package and was very inexpensive i did put a nice soft leather strap with a quick disconnect on it as there is no front strap button but no big deal there if you re looking for a nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing this would be a great place to start i see these selling used for what i paid for mine new so you re bot going to lose money on it either read the other reviews this is a really nice value it is still my only acoustic that i own my other guitars are all electrics or project guitars i do have my eye on a martin though plus stars for this one if you re considering it buy it you will not regret it i still play this on almost every day i have both the fender g dec and the and the line spider jam just blows them away the controls are much more intuitive than the g dec line like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so i could hear my guitar over it and i was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks or drum beats i wanted and the only time i had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easy i only mention these capabilities to compare with the fender line once you go further into the amp and get into the dubbing recording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedal the amp can get really loud and i don t see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side show since i have only had the amp for a short time i can t say anything about how it will holdup but i have other amps by different companies and the quality is just fine by the way i have a g dec for sale addendum the following is my take between the jam and the series do with it as you wish a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different years the spider does not have on board song or drum loops like the spider jam if you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then the isyour amp if you need a practice amp go with the jam i have both amps and as far as i am concerned the jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the spider does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the spider technology with a jm looper as its engine while the spider i have the is a nice amp it is very specific to the user needs and isnot that flexible i do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as i used the jam for a longtime without and only acquired the express pedal when i ordered the spider also be very aware that the line documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there so called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation i was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad i did i am now able to play record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound i recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar
1399	put this on my cheap acoustic guitar and it looks so good i might have to upgrade my guitar not much else to say about it it adjusts easily and does exactly what it is supposed to do this stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use it is well made and i would buy it again if needed i ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar he uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar he swears by them and loves how they stay in his grip without slipping while picking and going nutso on his guitars buy them you won t be sorry plus wow its a great price i bought two of these one for each of my sons and i wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age so far they seem awesome they adjust easily were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them definitely not a flimsy stand i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass he absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well nice sounds
1400	easy to mount solid grip on guitar only detractor would be that with my guitar at least it hangs kind of far from the wall this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though an acoustic would clear the wall nicely my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar without marring even soft wood i very much prefer this to having it on one of the accident waiting to happen stands on the floor this strap is not a bad one but it just did not fit my guitar so that is the only problem i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it this dunlop pick holder work good for an in expense product it is want i need for travel little hard to put picks in but ok snark tuners are great since i ve bought snark tuners they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way i ve had some for years that i still use today without ever changing batteries or anything they are great and last forever this one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine tune your instrument it have a vibration and mic sensor so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played really nice piece of equipment for a small price
1401	great product i ve use them before and have always thought they were top quality they aren t much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great easy installation without any modification at least on mine and they connect hold very solid just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap i needed picks so i ordered an assortment i have been trying different ones i seem to like them all these aren t usually my go to strings but d addarios are a good solid sounding string they last fairly long when taken care of and don t usually break too often i do like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing they will continue to be my nd string of choice as they ve not failed me any time i ve purchased them definitely recommended so you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing this strap is perfect even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well the materials are high quality soft nylon for the strap it feels kind of like a non stretch ace bandage durable non scratching marring plastic for the links and adjuster and a thick rubber material for the ends the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility again this material seems to be non marring all this and a secret compartment for picks overall a fantastic product with a price that can t be beat highly recommended five stars if an initially unfavorable opinion changes i owe it to the maker to say so so i m saying so for me the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used it s not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down in many cases they jump around until by the time they settle down the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers so a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved as far as the sn is concerned wrong i ve found the sn to in fact be super tight but one has to insure that there isn t even a hint of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar this is what i don t like about the other type of snark display it s not symmetric it requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green and none of the yellow bars to be lit if the rad bars are illuminated constantly how can you tell if the string is a hair flat when i m on pitch i want all indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish in that regard the image shown here is wrong it shows the super tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with green and even a yellow uhm no the sn is super tight has a touch metronome and lets you set it down a few semi tones if that s what floats your boat and as they say on tv all for an incredibly low price i keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag just in case at this price i already have a half dozen super tights with two more on the way
1402	if you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone this one works well it is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk having the microphone always plugged in accessible on the desk and ready to go means i save much setup time for my voice over work ordered a few of these should come in different sizes but for the price these are fine keep em in every case enjoy will buy again this works in some applications but doesn t work in many others even when detected by the software it will not work with line equipment too bad because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop arrived as expected and as described capo is well made and is very well priced i am very happy with the purchase
1403	i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar my first cheap cord wasn t actually broken but i didn t want any down time so i had this just sitting there as a replacement fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out even though my cheap cord was still working fine i really wanted to just try out the new cord i really wish i had done that in the first days this cord did not work right at all it seems like there is a short in it somewhere i had to unplug plug maneuver into place of course since it is for guitar it falls almost immediately out of place again so i am back to the cheap cord that hasn t failed unlike this brand new bad cable this is the stand you remember from the band room effective and built like a tank you will need a wrench to assemble a very simple task one note the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring invest in the optional foot covers if you re concerned a dull inept version of a tubescreamer just sounds flat and boring not very inspiring at all then again i never did really like ts s works great great little tuner i would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it but im pretty impressed works really well was a great price and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time the capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar there is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state this is a solid state people will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a tube amp to practice through you re not getting the right tone man the problem with that is there are several companies out there marshall fender vox orange etc and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one so i figured before i committed to a company maybe i could just use this fender to emulate some of those sounds i want that worked out beautifully though i am very much a beginner i have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp s eq can have on your guitar s tone i thought i needed pedals to have some of these effects instead i can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger reverb modulation i need i have got to the point where i understand about how just adjusting my volume switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when i want to i would not have been able to do that without this amp this amp helped me develop as a beginner so i wouldn t waste money buying other things beginners think they should get excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more
1404	i bought one of these to try on my asher junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick worked but it was difficult getting all three picks in one wedgie so i ordered a second one between the two of them between the nd rd and th th strings up next to the nut works pretty good holding these types of picks which admittedly the wedgie was not actually designed for liked it so much i ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass the bass version only down side i see is they do seem loose like they could fall out and i doubt the picks will stay in place when i case my guitar haven t tried it yet but otherwise worth the price and a good doo dad to have around especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself real help to me staying organized this is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole it would not work for an f hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge if you use distilled water as recommended it should last quite a while the top comes off with a gentle press on the sides the dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly don t push it all the way in after moistening and you won t have a problem i drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the d and g strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole they can t be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings i ve never had one of these move from where i left it if the sponge isn t dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case when the humidity is very low or less the sponge dries out in to days even if the case isn t opened as with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days if you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar or don t want to see one use a guitar humidifier especially during the winter heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels between and is ideal for most guitars air conditioning can do the same for especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar s is okay for many reasons it s always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use a humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly it works well i use it for my oscar schmidt i don t use it for feedback i use it to protect it from the dust it fits tight but it s fine nothing fancy snug fit for my mic kinda of thin compared to others that i have seen bought extras in case others wanted to use my mic i bought this brand because i have one of their mic stand mounts for iphone which i like a lot pros the clips did a good job holding my ipad mini without having to remove the folio type cover marware axis quality seems acceptable for the price the ball swivel works well cons it s too heavy for my mic stands i tried it on the boom arm and it made it top heavy and unstable if the boom is positioned in a very upright position it s ok but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome i had high hopes for this one but it s not going to work for me i have returned it and ordered a different chargercity model the one with the lever type mount
1405	bought this to hook up a beta to a panasonic g dslr and a kodak zi for interviews works the way it s supposed to degree trs is a nice touch good price strings on my accoustic were old probably corroded it was time to replace all with frest strings these are great did the job people like it who am i to disagree it works well but i wish i had discovered the gibson app on my iphone before i bought but for the price it does work a lot better never clip it to any body parts only on you guitar don t ask only kidding needed to get mic into computer via the usb port just try to find amazon had it and at a good price great hook supports a lot of weight looks good on any wall i would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application
1406	impressed with this set i installed them today and have been playing for a few hours my wife thinks my guitar looks better now and i agree im not sure if they are supposed to be flush and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out i think my guitars tone has improved a little too but i also installed new strings qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system the cables are of a pretty good quality with solid connectors and well constructed the cable itself is a bit rubbery and not slinky like some of the higher grade microphone cables but so far they have held up fine the cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier use it on acoustic and electric always lose them before i ever wear them out i dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker it works perfect with cakewalk music creator and a digitech vocalist best price out there these are perfect for those using dunlop strap locks but have more guitars than straps these are allparts parts quick usps shipping
1407	i never had one of these until i had to twist each tuner around times to change a string but that s not a problem any more i used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends but that s not a problem any more and i used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic but that s not a problem any more either all solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case so i m a fan you ll be too beautiful tone and durable string nice tension very good for bends sweep picking and rakes did i mentioned great value picked up some blue steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone also was the last to pick it up for shipped to my door if you like a parlor guitar this might be for you the case is kick ass too easily a value update after putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner along with putting on new strings this guitar rocks putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone this is my go to guitar sounds good and has great intonation the only fore seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning i have a washburn d and love this just as much for the cost for years i have fell more and more in love with my yamaha cgx sc stil nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo note change to a better piezo system lr baggs are great high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes i wanted to experiment with this item result great i finally got to listen to what i use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments the sound is richer and clarity makes unique this is one of the best simple to use guitar tuners i ve used and i ve used a lot of them the bonus is that it s also one of the least expensive that i ve seen you won t be disappointed
1408	cant go wrong great quality on a budget price hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up i deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars basses amps fx midi gear etc over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy noisy pots knobs input and output jacks that are crackly etc in the past i ve tried some locktite electronics cleaner which is provided in a similar can it would rarely work in contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear i ve used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks it s really like magic in a can for me i can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height the padding is great it is lightweight without feeling cheep i ve owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw the pots all still work without adding noise and in general the device does exactly what i need it to do you won t find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp mixer i love the pads and the knobs i used it with live the software side requires a bit of configuration to work with some software but ultimately was stable and functional except with my laptop the usb power supply must be noisy because the lpd will lose its connection and power if you even gently touch one of the cables however it works fine if i use a very cheap powered usb hub in between i suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply so it may not work in some configurations lose a star because i really love it but in my configuration i am not willing to add a gratuitous usb hub and another wall wart to my road rig nice try akai updated update jan i have tried a different lpd to compare it does not have the problem on the systems where my old lpd would be flaky the new lpd is rock solid it appears that i have a broken one with an intermittent problem if yours has this problem send it back while it s still in warranty so that s nice now it s really a great product that i can um sort of recommend to everyone however considering that akai professional has us doing their qc for them i d suggest saving the shipping box in case you need to return it for an exchange at least for a few weeks first of all don t be oversold by the extraordinary value that some reviewers claim this fifty buck inputting device to be akai is considered a budget priced version of and a step down from sony which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself but it s the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with garageband band in the box finale sibelius audacity or a similar program the last thing i would do is lug a pound pc or sp kurzweil model plus ac power transformer upstairs to place on an over crowded desk even the pound yamaha np with its notes is awkward to use for this purpose make it nothing longer than a note keyboard but if you can get one at half the price of the e music note that may be the handiest most practical device for your needs sure there are alternatives you can click at a virtual keyboard that garageband makes available for a mouse but it s slow or you can download a virtual keyboard to your ipad or ipod for a couple of bucks but it s limited to no more than an octave and a touch screen which though superior to mouse clicking still isn t as satisfying or immediate as inputting by pressing down on actual physical keys this cheaply made even cheap but effective akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely especially for someone who s working in congested space it s regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard it s nothing of the sort nor should it be that s the reason i initially went with the np only to find that the bi purpose instrument i had in mind was impractical for either intended use take a look at the korg nano piano and if you re a pianist you ll immediately see the superiority of the akai but be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the akai or the e music or you ll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name performance this akai model looks and feels like a kindergartner s ten dollar toy but it s the best compromise i ve been able to turn up for my crowded work area
1409	buttons itself are fine however when i was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar right above the thread and i even pre drill it there is no way i can get it out so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it now slightly off center now well this is a very simple accessory but also a very convenient one you can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag works and it is good no problem very standard one all your own preferences so you need to try it out before you say if that works for you i ve got several guitars and capos this one is not too bad i would still prefer classic style seems like spring is a bit too strong price is great thou
1410	i started using kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since i now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them they work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children i teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times great capos you won t be disappointed i really did not expect much from this rag i just wanted a good quality lint free scratch free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use i was totally surprised that it actually works this good removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner this will probably help protect your finish over the long run too you may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag this thing rocks it picks up every smudge smear print and leaves nothing behind it s an amazing little cleaning tool and i will replace it if when it ever wears out if you are like me and you want your instruments to look clean grunge free onstage you should check out this little wonder you can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want doesn t get any easier great product a note about the mixed reviews i really wish amazon would separate the different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page it really isn t fair to the actual good product to have it s rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a completely different item it also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want when i go to the product page for the amazingly good micro fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint it makes me sad i have had both of the other items and this micro fiber cloth is nothing like the other this item has sewn seamed edges that will not fray it never leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind no scratches no lint no hint it was ever there my guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth and i use the thing almost every day i got on this rant bc i came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it i told him i would just get another then i came here and couldn t remember which version i bought and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item leaves behind lint what the crap are they talking about turns out they are talking about a completely different item i looked up my purchase history and found i had bought the micro fiber then i placed an order for more for me to give away again putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course putting an apple and a lemon on the same page literally and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed at least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones you know what version to buy and which to avoid anyway end rant this is a great guitar once you change the strings as suggested great portability for the price however having read reviews across multiple sites i too am a victim of the horrible glue smell that so many others have complained about i really liked the guitar so i purhcased it from two separate retailers but had to return both due to the horrific smell i even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a smell free case and they sent a case but it stunk too it s a shame i had to return them because they were nice little guitars the stand is very well constructed and very stable the other stands that i have used were all bottom holders i was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder but then again all guitar stores display their guitars with them so i thought lets have a go i m glad i did my stand doesn t tip over like the others you just have to lift up before you take your instrument out the fingers in front hold the instrument in lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument i had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that i almost sent it back but with a little trial and error i figured it out that said this thing is rock solid i was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a ipad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip
1411	hello musicfriends this is built cheap but sounds great good controls too for me in the studio songwriting its perfect but i would not exactly go on tour with it there is something about the knobs i still love even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it may be the age thing i borrowed a friends mxr to try and liked the added sounds it gave me it filled a hole that was missing since of my board is behringer pedals i looked at behringer first and was delighted when i found the ph classic side by side with the mxr there wasn t a hole lot of difference and with the behringer s added swirl switch gives you a few more options it also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals i ve read a ton of reviews and still haven t heard of one breaking because of the plastic as far as value to money spent this pedal is again at the top of the list oh it also sounds great i had two of these and wound up selling one because i never used it the one i kept is currently serving as a keyboard amp for two keyboards simultaneously aroland rd nx digital stage pianoand aroland v combo key stage keyboard i was able to do this because there are two inputs on the front of the amp input is designed for normal sensitivity and input is designed for guitars with active pickups thus far i have had no problems with both boards connected at the same time and it does not seem to matter which board is connected to which input the sound is impressive exceptionally clean and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound which helps significantly when running keyboards through it moreover the amp is loud if you choose to make it so and even at high gain settings it has ample headroom if you want distortion this is probably not the amp for you you can switch it from clean to drive to more drive but it is essentially still a clean sounding amp i find this to be a plus but i have met my share of guitarists who think otherwise another great feature is you can daisychain these amps using the pre out on the master to the pwr in on the aux amp s you can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop i personally have no use for those features but i can see how they could be useful overall i love the amp and wish fender made a single model because it is pretty heavy and bulky those are hardly significant complaints since i sometimes regret selling my second one because if something happens to the one i still have i would replace it immediately
1412	wow these cables are made really sturdy and the noiseless feature is priceless definitely a real good value for the money best string capo i have ever used and that s over decades works easily and flawlessly very well made five stars this is a nice sturdy well made guitar stand it is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly first saw on youtube video how genius a pick that stays in hand makes me wonder how ever played without them small price for big help i use the cable great build quality looks professional sturdy plugs and most importantly it sounds great i like the smooth fabric sleeve it doesn t stick to things like a plastic rubber cable can i play nights a week in a midi assisted duo our pa is a pair of mackie thumps powered on the floor and behringer b d powered on stands with a mackie board we adjust the pa to the room by adding or reducing the number of powered speakers in larger rooms we have a regular pair of floor monitors but in smaller rooms where you are stuck in a corner between the coat rack and the waiters station you know the spot where they generously removed two small tables we don t have space for floor monitors these smaller jobs have become much more common and i needed a compact yet powerful monitor since we work with midi sound modules to reproduce the drums bass and assorted extra instuments it is very important that we hear these sounds clearly the behringer monitors do the job well the overall sound is clean and clear the speakers are light and portable and for me the boom stand adapter works well i compared the behringers to their clone the mackie srm and frankly i couldn t hear a major difference with my mp player playing through them obviously behringer cloned the mackie s and did a good job they have all of the same inputs and outputs as the mackie s and look almost exactly the same i have owned a pair of behringer b d powered speakers for about three years now and they have been knocked over and mistreated accidentally and still work great every night so i am a fan of behringer gear in the end the real difference was the price the behringer s go for while the mackie s go for about the choice was simple since i couldn t hear or see a major difference i bought the behringer s i have only had them for about two months but i have been pleased so far update it has been a couple of months more since i started using these monitors and have even purchased an additional one i still love the sound and all of the other things i posted above but forget about the boom stand adapter it is very difficult to get lined up so the mic is facing you and because of the angle of the monitor itself which is not adjustable the boom will not stay in place i am using a good quality telescoping mini boom that is not very big or heavy at all but it will not stay up save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand other than that these are great monitors this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there i play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen it worked but i don t use it anymore i have been using an app on my cell phone until i purchased this from amazon this thing is awesome it s so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it oh and it turns itself off after seconds of no sound it does get a little sensitive when tuning in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark but the more i use it the better feel i get for it if you don t have one get one
1413	put it in my fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well love it to death had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility the built in volume knob it a great tough i could go on but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better job than here if you can t find a container and add your own sponge then buy this keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential i think this item should cost three bucks at most and would still yield a healthy profit i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better i use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughts if you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood i just got this yesterday so i don t know how long it will prolong the string s life but i have noticed a difference already it s a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone also it s cheap so i would give it a shot if i were you i m really happy that i discovered this product in fact i m already ordering more the winder works really well and same with the cutter but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome i guess for taking w you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool but if using at home then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter that s what i do anyway still i think is a good tool to have yup it s o k nothing special i don t know if it s the best one out there but it does the job great price easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar it does what it is designed for can t ask for more i use this for my acoustic primarily but sometimes for my electric guitar it is accurate and easy to use
1414	i am so happy with this product that after buying the first one i bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin in this price point it s a good capo if you know how to put one on and use it i use it for lessons in case a kid steals it so i m not losing my g capo which was great capo in my years of playing the guitar i have settled on d addario as my string of choice when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy i m really glad i did the tone is great they re durable and smooth on the fingers even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell like tone that mandolinists are after they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels you can play sweet classical passages roaring bluegrass and even rock i have a high end washburn f style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good this is the pack to get thanks d addario for providing an awesome product i like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing these picks are nice but just too small my only regret is that i had taken more time to research the size they work well just need to be a little bigger cool little digital tuner that works great on my ukulele small and unobtrusive unlike my other digital tuners i like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance highly recommended
1415	bought to tune my bass works fine and at the this price it cant be beat highly recommend for budget tuner i hate winding strings i got this to help with that it does it job very well you can string your guitar in a fraction of the time it could be a little tougher but as long you don t give it hell it will be fine great and cheap product good price for an pack of pickups any guitarist need a pack of these because its not too heavy and very durable they are a wonderful product the lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar with these you can t go wrong nice comfortable very comfortable to use and easy to install on the guitar and was just like the picture showed easy to use from day one and i am a beginner at the guitar would recommend it to any one
1416	for the money you can t find a better deal i am currently overseas and didn t want to bring my good guitar along this is a great playing guitar for the money comes packaged extremely well and high quality all around for the price it is my son s first guitar and he is learning on it well it is still in great condition good quality guitar these pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price well designed and reliable i highly recommend these thanks to amazon for offering this great product this is a good quality strap it is wide and has leather ends it fits my les paul just fine and i am sure it willlast a long time with normal use can t go wrong for the price the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget the d slap echo effects pedal works great and gives me that old tube amp reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit there s no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all this series of pedals fab have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well danelectro offers more expensive units but i don t think the sound is much better just the hardware is better but that s my view you can t go wrong with this product danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great this amp is small in size but full of sound because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks very responsive very clean sounding this amp is well worth the price as usual another good piece of equiptmentfrom behringer i not only use it for my guitars but also on my keyboardmakes real good sound very adaptable again will buy more of their products as usual most of my purchases on amazon were quality stuff at good prices very efficient and fast delivery times this is a great product very light very sturdy and at a low price well worth the investment
1417	for only a few bucks this little item is extremely convenient i placed it on a filing cabinet next to where i practice and filled it up love love love the hastle free access to my picks thanks guys for the great little product all smiles unit works fine with my digital piano it s light portable and fairly sturdy the price is right for what you get i only have a low cost mahala ukulele so i wasn t expecting much of an improvement when i replaced the stock nylon strings after watching several youtube videos showing me how to do it i was wrong these strings sound much better the sound is much brighter and cleaner than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new the aquila strings took about minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods my ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers i would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better there is a problem with the design when you move the head the little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head just break off the tuner itself is great but the product fails because it broke in minutes what a good buy this gig bag is nicely made looks great and the padding is really nice luv the zip pocket in the front perfect for strap snark capo whatever bought this for my hubby s tenor uke and one just like it tho smaller for my concert uke highly recommend it only cost around so my expectations weren t very high to begin with but right out of the box it had a hole in the stitching and the front pocket was sown on crooked i don t plan on keeping it long this stand holds up my ukulele so yay folded up it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the hola gig bag which i also use and heartily recommend make no mistake this stand is not pretty it feels and looks like cheap plastic but it does the job
1418	i have several overdrive pedals some of which are much more expensive than the boss sd for a long time i overlooked my sd and used other pedals but when i went back to trying the sd i was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals i had been using i don t mean merely that it s very good relative to its price i mean that it s very good period it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about on amazon at that price it s an amazingly good deal note this is definitely an overdive pedal it will not deliver metal distortion at least not by itself if you want to ride the crazy train look elsewhere like deltalab s metal distortion pedal what this produces is smooth old style overdrive it s excellent it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus i plug my sd into a fender mustang ii amp and turn on the amp s chorus the result is delicious i ve used the sd with both single coil and double coil pickups both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker but it sounds great with single coils too this tremelo pedal works nicely and it s great when you re playing through an amp without tremelo problem solved the price was also very good if you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about digitech effects pedals they ll tell you to stay away from them except for this one that s because the digitech bad monkey tube overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by boss or the ts tubescreamer in fact the ts tubescreamer is the pedal the bad monkey is best compared to this is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone notes will sing and chords will really crunch especially in blues and classic rock but since the pedal works well as a level gain boost i ve heard of guitarists turning on the bad monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects to really push them to new levels but the best feature of the bad monkey by far is the two band eq virtually any distortion pedal has a tone control that will make the tone darker or brighter but since one band eq basically takes away bass to add treble or vice versa you may not find the sound you want that s what s so great about the bad monkey if you feel like your tone is too weak you can fatten it up if it s too muddy you can add treble and you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like construction is extremely durable die cast metal and probably heavier than a boss pedal the switch is more similar to a boss than an ibanez pedal but i find that easier to use if you re a beginning player or a player on a budget this would be an outstanding pedal to own along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal there s really no need to spend the extra money on a tubescreamer if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear but even for player where money is not an object don t overlook the bad monkey it might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you ll need i have several mxr pedals every one is superb except for this phase the non script version reviewed here this phase is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion a swoosh of sonic dirt i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal s distortion suggest some modifications look up mxr phase mods and erik s corner will show you how i made the r c and c modifications the result a slightly improved phaser one that still churned out plenty of distortion finally i tried adjusting the internal trim pot on no setting could i get rid of you guessed it distortion i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable no luck bottom line if you want a phaser that doesn t add significant distortion avoid this incarnation of the phase this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn t it try something else i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended to be honest i m not metal guitarist but i do love metal music and as far as playing goes i love bluesy solos with lots of distortion i decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix one of the best names in the business and for the fact it was cheaper than most i m very pleased with the pedal and couldn t be happier if you re not familiar with ehx s signature distortion fuzz pedal the big muff please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out describing its sound with words helps but doesn t really do it justice it definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you ll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand they re one of my very favorite effects honestly so for this review i m going to focus more on how the little big muff stacks up against the other models for starters this version takes care of all of the common complaints regarding the nyc reissue its true bypass its much smaller not super tiny like a boss but a little slimmer than say the wider mxr pedals like the phase it uses a normal v adapter jack thank you finally it sounds better yes it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has this one is smoother not as creamy as the russians but it also doesn t suck tone like that one does either its a touch higher gain than both the russians and the tone wicker versions but all in all it absolutely is a big muff so if you re in the market for one of these and you don t want the options the tone wicker muff provides this is absolutely where its at its better in every way than the ny reissue also it costs less money yay first i don t like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my fender blues deville sound distorted they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal there s a difference think about it if you don t get it second i don t like having a lot of pedals i play in a rock country band were we play music that sounds like neil young tom petty ccr etc just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of chords and an occasional minor th i just want an overdrive my digitech bad monkey and my arion tuner but i need distortion when we do covers ac dc hendrix etc the deville can do hendrix if you turn it up to but of course then it s too loud based on those criteria the digitech cm is perfect the classic overdrive setting allows me to sound like hendrix or rocking neil young or any other rock band from the s and s the modern setting allows me to sound more like s and s rock e g guns n roses and soundgarden and this is important both settings make my amp sound like it is being overdriven it sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point it sounds fricken awesome it does not sound like an amplified pedal so i can use the bad monkey i ve reviewed it on amazon if you want to read it for boosting my clean sound i use the cm if i want to play dirtier and for covers two pedals plus the tuner and i can play everything i want i m happy i really like this cable maybe it s not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine i keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away it probably stretches feet if you really need it too what i really like is that it s compact and i don t have cables laying all over the floor overall it s a solid cable for practice i ll buy more
1419	i was first exposed to the hercules locking mechanism when our praise band leader brought in his hercules two guitar stand and i tried it with both my full size string guitar and my string banjo i was impressed when i decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room amateur studio i was excited to find that the same hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall hanger models i put them on my wish list where my son daughter in law found them and bought three for me for christmas this last weekend i just finished putting them up and i m completely satisfied with their solid construction they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably i used the provided screws which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls i probably wouldn t trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall but instead get something more substantial to mount it like a toggle anchor what i m happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments the opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and string guitars but not so wide as to not support my string banjo i ve submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical string guitars and string banjo my friend plays gretch semi hollow body and fender solid body and other electric guitars with his hercules guitar stand so i assume they would also work with the wall hangers i am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy works well arrived fast no problems works as described a good purchase for a low priced capo works for acoustic and electric expect less for that price excellent fine manufacturing good finish perfect for my line wt it works well at all heights great deal for the price and very sturdily made easy to assemble and feels solid recommend this if you re tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music i bought the two pack and i ve found them both to be a bit finicky sometimes they turn on right away and other times you have to click the button a couple times to get it to light up when they re on and working they work well and i like the small size and tight profile against the headstock i just wish they were a little more reliable
1420	serves its purpose worked better when i added a quick disconnect attachment quality finish comfortable and enough range to adjust as needed i actually use this stand for more than holding a mic i use it for video and photo purposes holding light reflectors flagging speedlights etc it s heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo this is a great stand for your violin or viola i use it all the time and i feel that my violin is very safe in it at gigs i had read many reviews on sm clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job it seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone the gls es same with the sm es i had to give it a shot i run the sound for local bands and i use sm s because they can take abuse and still sound great only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far i really like it the frequency band is not identical to the sm as some others have said a little less bass but that doesn t mean it is a thin sound it certainly is not i can get it to sound the same as the sm if i eq it slightly but i like the natural sound anyway also the signal is a bit hotter but i really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments value for money it can t be beat if you are on a budget get one they did the job they re plastic they didn t cost much fit my string with no problems they aren t bone brass wood pearl don t expect them to be
1421	this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record but frankly the old discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap and a new paint brush then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth just try not to get the labels wet this product did not fit my takamine g as the hole is size i had to buy from lute hole who then customized a part for me beware because you d figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there given the advertising even the guy at guitar center when i called to find out what was going on told me to go with lute hole i never had a use for such an item before very recently but upon necessity i found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar even if it does fit be very very careful in fact be very very wary as i briefly heard a light cracking noise when i tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time i stopped thereafter after doing research online and finding out about the g s specs i ve read elsewhere that it kills your tone but i had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig ultimately i spent nearly more than i wanted to just for this kind of item what is it they say in this era caveat emptor i was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy or thick guitar pick i saw this and had to try it they are very solid don t bend and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar haven t tried them yet on an electric but they should be great there too you need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action not a surprise but the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat anyway these are great guitar picks if you re looking for something solid and long lasting if you are ordering these to replace one or two of your gibson speed knobs you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to gibson s in all fairness these could possibly be better than gibson s stock seem to be made with a more solid underside but the numbers are a little bit smaller this is the only reason i gave them four stars fit perfectly on cts potentiometers and if you replace all four of them nobody except you will know lol all four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects as opposed to other reviews if you get these and they aren t perfect send them back until you get a perfect set it s free hope this helps not much else to say bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar i am re doing i ve learned the hard way that there are some things you don t skimp on and this is one switchcraft is what we used in the air force years ago and are still some of the best made electronic components out there
1422	this is a really nice product for the price when fully extended it becomes a little tippy but i don t fully extend the legs which gives it a wider more stable base otherwise it folds up nice and small for travel nice product i paid dollars for this it must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it s not cheap at all folds up for transport works great on hardwood floors padded where it needs to be and has a strap so it doesn t fall forward either angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet look for something where the legs enter the carpet more straight down it is an excellent backup capo i don t feel the spring is strong enough to do the proper job i use steel strings perhaps it would be good for nylon strings like the other one star reviewers my problem is that the head broke off i tried to glue it back on but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that if you buy this you really need to baby it my advice is look for a more sturdy model seems like it draws current even when it s off i have two guitars and this thing stays with one guitar i make sure to turn this tuner off before putting the guitar away and when i get around to playing the guitar again to days later the battery is already drained this happened at least three times already the tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that i have to compare against i don t know which one is more accurate the good thing is it s very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it i probably won t buy again for my other and future guitars
1423	it s a lot smaller than the picture makes it look but that s a good thing it serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock now a days i just search amazon because they have always got what i want at reasonable prices this is no exception i am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my epiphone les paul custom pro to the guitar guy for setup etc this was was better then i expected it is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit in other words great all around i know it sits on a self with many other guitars when i take it in to the guitar guys so i am perfectly confident that it is well protected and it is lockable with key if you are looking for a more then good case for your epi lp just get this one you will not be disappointed also i ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day no special shipping maybe it is my locations but that was great too well packed originally i purchased a behringer eq equalizer pedal for my rig it was cheap at around some change but like the other reviewers noted it s noisy with hiss so i took the advice of another reviewer bought the fish chips model by danaelectro and it s terrific i plugged it directly in line on my skb pedal board turned them both on turned on the amp put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max no discernible hiss nor hum mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable this pedal has a cool s style appearance it has a great punch when you raise up the level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar amp sounds for a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the price tag if you re in the market for a great band eq pedal then you ll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one this product rates out of possible stars i love this guitar strap button it s a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in i actually purchased it for my newmahalo u pk sparkling soprano ukulele outfit in pink it works well for it s stated purpose and appears to be of high quality the leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole check out my user name stinkylungs on youtube to see a video i made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close this is a great guitar for the money i paid for my guitar and bought it through amazon com from streamline audio video it arrived ahead of schedule in great shape ready to play right out of the box after tuning it of course if you want a better guitar than this you will need to spend a whole lot more the sound is great and it is easy to play only about long and may weigh a bit over the lbs stated in the description my strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what i will need these are the original perfect fit on my american deluxe strat so durable i got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful d good stuff it s a simple strap button don t know what else to say i can t imagine a strap button not serving it s purpose i hate minimum word review requirements no cable noise works well with pedals that don t play nice with other right angle plugs like the original line of aguilar pedals great little product and i would buy them again this is a cheap and easy upgrade at about years old my mim standard strats hardware was starting to show her age most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust for about bucks i was able to replace all the screws springs bridge neck plate this is stage one of my rebuild the tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality fold don t forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them this thing sounds amazing except for one small problem at higher gain settings it hisses like a mother i m not talking about extreme settings just gain and character thats what tech calls it forgot what joyo calls it at o clock it has a beautiful warm singing lead tone better than any pedal that i have owned and that s probably distortion overdrive pedals if only it didn t hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal if you have a rocktron hush or other noise gate pedal it is worth considering the joyo is an exact clone of the tech british pedal which costs i don t know it the tech has the same hissing problem or not a bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo but well made i don t think that you would go wrong
1424	i have had one for two years and no complaints needed another for my travel guitar the lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck the spring is firm and in years has not given up any tension finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple i take particular caution to make sure that i don t leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently it beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better it slips off if you go too fast but i thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this it didn t come with much of any instructions so i was using it wrong at first there is a big and a small slot the cutter is so that i pinched my finger during use the cutter works great you just have to be careful the screw that holds it on keeps coming loose sure i can tighten it but it just means the design could be better all and all it s one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master i hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesn t scratch the chrome off my turner pegs that and maybe they could use a long screw and some loctite to keep it from coming loose and well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find everything i have seems to be jet black play very mello easy on my fingers too can t come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on my taylor acoustic i have not used mine yet but my brother in law says it looks like i got the same strings on my guitar already i trust him he knows more about guiatars than i do i have been playing music for years and often i lose my picks during a performance i took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers best pick ever i bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home he has guitars everywhere i am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars it is pretty good at staying in place though i own at least of these i use them on all of my instruments including banjo mandolin guitar and ukelele for the price they cannot be beat and they leave a small footprint too i seem to have problem with getting it to hear low e of all strings but it is very compact and convenient to use
1425	i used this for a while but now i have the behringer ch rack mount and this rarely gets used also every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp i still use this for practice at home this thing is amazing like many i cannot afford a tube amp this transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps i played years ago sustain and harmonics are insane preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones the unit is very heavy and rugged the only component i would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost ok for the price tuners old style not sealed pup plate mal adjusted and off quite a bit i d suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions on the positive action and intonation good better than expected much better than most chinese guitars at the same price level however i ve purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less that said you ll probably do ok epiphone setup and overall quality better than the squier big disappointment i ve been so impressed by epiphone s but this one didn t do it quality of manufacture and assembly great pickups far less than inspiring yes it s a great platform but was so expecting those p sound i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it just didn t have the tone and bite i was expecting i could certainly invest in some pup s but i have too many great p guitars to bother roll of the dice i guess
1426	after tons of experimenting i settled on the exl for d standard and e flat standard i ve tried but the top is a little too floppy for d and that makes notes sound out of tune if you don t press the string just right also tried and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string that reduces articulation so while you get a fuller sound with the you get more dynamics and attack with the and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier you can eq fullness into a rhythm track but you can t add in pick attack and greater dynamics tension wise at d standard is ideal but is doable sound wise has been best for my metal recordings and that s why i m sticking with the exl set from now on i also replaced the g string with a gauge wound for better sounding power chords and compared to ernie balls d addarios start off less bright but maintain their brightness longer thus a more even and predictable response over time martins are no doubt excellent strings the light strings carry excellent deep tone and are not to hard on my fingers straps don t get any better than this super leather very well put together perhaps a bit wide but i play short sets for the gigging pro i think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight excellent just excellent its not a very big capo like it looks in the picture and is sometimes hard to get on sometimes but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done the only problem i have with it is that i get the strings a little bent but that might just be me
1427	it took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic but with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio these have worked great when i ve needed to have input vs the xlr especially when i bust out the old tascam track cassette some times i like recording drums analog versus digital or other instruments it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price works great with moonflowers and lasers i have gotten the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights i really wanted to use it halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn t want it out on the porch next year the pack is a fantastic deal i ve been around mics under for years and when compared to other mics in the range they are as good or better good lows and clean highs without any hiss absolutely no whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp don t miss out on this great deal shipped in time didn t test microphones yet but i think this is best price for microphones according to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well i ll check it later it does the job to do my home made music demos nothing professional though im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes
1428	looks good but disappointed that they aren t made in the usa oh well just shows me little by little more and more things aren t anymore bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat doesn t fit perfect kinda bummed but oh well i was happy it was made in the usa but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn t done by shipping ok its cheap you knew that when you bought it i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture it was only one and it was red broke with first use actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great had issues before with company but they resolved all issues i would do business with them again thanks for taking care of me pleasure doing business with you nice reverb can get all of the reverb sounds you want got to play with it but i got dialed in easy there is no shortage of tubescreamer clones on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues jazz and rock the digitech bad monkey is one such example but the chinese made joyo jf vintage distortion just be the best and it s half the price of a ts about the manufacturer joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor very similar to an mxr in size and switch but cloning the circuitry of well known classic and modern boutique effects pedals some people jump to conclusions about chinese products but don t just take it from me do your homework the response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive and there are great vendors distributors within the u s that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days i m definitely a fan of joyo products as for the vintage distortion itself people have said it s based on either a ts or the more expensive ts frankly while the latter is apparently warmer and less mid range heavy than the former i m not sure there s any significant difference i played this jf side by side with my ts and it s probably one of the more exact clones in the joyo lineup for example the joyo ultimate drive is an excellent higher gain overdrive pedal based on a fulltone ocd but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there some of which are arguably better than the original with the settings matched the jf performed almost exactly like the ts in level gain and tone there probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full which isn t a bad thing it s very responsive to your playing style and again it sounds like a tubescreamer i ll probably be keeping my tubescreamer if only because it s an iconic pedal that performs well but it s superior in name only if i had to use the joyo vintage overdrive in its place i d be no worse for the wear stars highly recommended very nice compressor i leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone sustain can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing quiet much quieter than other compressors in this price range no concerns here
